although I had visited the USA for at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extraordinary .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have been danced to American music , read American writers and operated his sports .
in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
when I was 14 years old , I saw the grand D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered mur@@ der@@ ous consp@@ iracy of an oil Mag@@ nat@@ i , who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I think it was as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only strengthened .
I said , &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose variety is so inviting , that you can always be that you are and it &apos;s easy to find in a community of equal people .
I even had a very shy love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about tourism and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as it goes with its nar@@ row@@ ness .
he never stops with his mind behind the mountain , as it is so beautiful .
he tells exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declar@@ es his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women .
but the people responded to his statements and tuned them in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million voices , which he won at rep@@ ubli@@ can elections , was the highest number one ever achieved by the party .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ ots person , I asked myself ?
I was able to bring Tr@@ ump and his v@@ oter with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the Journ@@ alists Program , taking up people from around the world , a deep belie@@ ving person that I could talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tr@@ ump Welt@@ anschau@@ ung not agreed with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours of watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ ump int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gled for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family that treated me as their son .
it still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es who always helped me with patience and grace , and helped me to get used to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my mentor , had helped me a lot at my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied through them are deep@@ ened my love toward America .
while Tr@@ ump his way to the appointed rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , said the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people have voted for tr@@ ump , because they were either on rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump voters as a breed .
to sub@@ ordin@@ ate people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ ful and indicates in@@ ability to understand who are acting and thinking in a different way .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not considered about hec@@ tic changes in their congregations .
could it be that these voters have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they would say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who disc@@ usses the cruel decision to rise a man who looks like contemp@@ t on those who look differently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( Fig . ) . : as much as &quot; based on white against all other Eth@@ nia &quot; ; word game from white into play on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash ( as much as Sch@@ leu@@ kin @-@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones , has exactly what America did so great .
millions people around the world estimate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you always like , America is welcome every welcome .
for this country chose as his President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise of this promise and says , Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole not@@ ion of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is once again on the ruin , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election .
at a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ aring the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices got lou@@ der .
&quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with his words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that isn &apos;t your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

from mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music by waste

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Church in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic town of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that is played in both places is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca , and # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from nearby excellent lum@@ bar and its world famous kitchen .
for several years , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : one out of children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of their musical instruments to overcome the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students is for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and gangs .
but this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot that started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope .
the young band members take their comm@@ it@@ ments to the music group very seriously , meaning local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they are always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le you meet day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga play .
music from garbage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practically on the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay , on instruments which are made of recycled waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments , which consist of local waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recy@@ c@@ ler started under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez to turn parts of waste in instruments .
instruments can im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , c@@ elli , double bass , guitar , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of garbage .
the re@@ pertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , re@@ members the beginning of the time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ sals and we had to teach in the same place the children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not cooperate with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made of waste was made .
today , there is a whole orchestra which plays out on instruments made of resur@@ rec@@ ted material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about a billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the bri@@ ghtest - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring drama from tr@@ ash to music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music by Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illi@@ c@@ it illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental issues .
the publication happens during an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , for shared use of content .
in West Africa it was then known that this ship was already in illegal waters of illegal fishing , before it looked up the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were thus raised and inc@@ lined to welcome a bill in its co@@ asts .
in Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ res , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised himself against the ship . they refused to carry him to their har@@ bours and refused to judge him a fishing ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the region &apos;s waters : it was not succeeded to catch fish there .
in the end , it was forced to pay 2 million dollars in Liberia , due to pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which explo@@ res criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network were distributed by six countries that had exp@@ elled the Premier of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition , what is caught is hidden , absent because it is extremely difficult to locate it . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , which should be protected by certain habit@@ ats and species , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
however , while actions against illegal fishing was once hin@@ dered by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ dles , the actions happen today in real @-@ time , with trace@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange or read list@@ ings , news about susp@@ ect activities or details that you notice or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very alert when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this enables the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas - such as susp@@ ects to discover that a ship invites his caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such studies show if the ships have a fishing license where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal .
countries that are opposed to illegal fishing are allowed on the basis of this information that the ships cannot be sold in their har@@ bours . and that they could not sell their cargo to numbers , as in the case of Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Executive Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales , which lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fis@@ her that penet@@ rate into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive fish fisher@@ ies that attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing trade around the world . among these even those illegal fishermen .
among other things include promotions , such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ feit license papers , specif@@ ying f@@ antas@@ ia names , fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this legal tor@@ ch tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 suspic@@ ious ships .
it has revealed criminal networks that had spread counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several dec@@ eit@@ ful ident@@ ities and it has fled and found wing@@ ed ships .
due to his cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across major distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to su@@ stain suspic@@ ious ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , also helps to track the illegal ships to hide .
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we are trying to pass through , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Che@@ fan@@ aly@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , a N@@ RO who also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can &apos;t be used by satellite .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects various information of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i should help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
one model program
but if F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the inevitable global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform in cooperation with Google and the marine protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and is able to display the position of every trace@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; accum@@ ulate with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - that is simply sense , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run with which a global system permits the persecution of ships .
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als , but also d@@ eter them .
ships which previously explo@@ ited without license and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , now know they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i already have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats or more licenses .

the movements in Venezuela appear to be the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the presi@@ dency of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of opposition to a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the emp@@ t@@ iness when they were gathered on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) can be found in both these demonstrations and arguments against and against them .
the debate will also lead to other parts of the country - including the Bar@@ inas region , located in the Are@@ as region of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central region of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Isla Margar@@ ita in the State Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country wor@@ sens continuously , which makes itself noticeable in everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by a acute lack of food and drugs .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the counter@@ part of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; ultimately , the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .

the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme , &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the fairy tales , which are published in real time , bear witness among others an overwhelming participation in people in many areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
one of the most shared images shows a demonstr@@ ators that calls through the prot@@ ector : &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot;

particularly large waves struck the news on police op@@ pression in the central north @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , protest@@ ers returned to the local cathedral to protect itself according to his own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ nes state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t carry skirts because you could see something many national gar@@ den@@ ds !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ograph@@ ics makes the round which forms the degree of op@@ pression per day :
so the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for a criminal proceedings - this was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .

here is your counter@@ part !

others have taken this protests as a further step in the fight against a government that made little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis , making it more difficult to be able to tune in critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the fairy tales always take more frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean city Córdoba .
now , the adult man said Qui@@ j@@ ano in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were examined for crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden , the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed in the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he kept a family secret for 34 years .
in the circumstances , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ne@@ ous .
as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
at that time , I could not realize that my father was a thief , fol@@ klore , and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ wer . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was from 1976 to 1978 . he was Deputy Chief of Intelligence 141 in the Pr@@ ison La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors who was charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , killing in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the magn@@ itude of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he spoke before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent on his child , and as this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you are friends with one of the ERP .
just don &apos;t worry , that they will not escape you one day and then I have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Tur@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my Father had raised me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university clas@@ ps , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

because over there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me to La Per@@ la four times - all in 1976 .
on the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the car , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small wrapped par@@ cel and told me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects have been removed and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he fell on an open space and said :
over there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a b@@ unk@@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they stood at the end of a cable hanging . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body which was ti@@ ch@@ ained .
they captiv@@ ate a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , shot him with water and sent him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ is@@ i@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the stri@@ fe there was terrible ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same od@@ or came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much harm another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were treated to eye .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilian that was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked man lay with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance , people tran@@ quil to the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I met &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot;
I knew that people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were buried by soldiers and buried .
I know that , because my father told me home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were known as offices .
I know , &quot; Pal@@ ito , &quot; Rom@@ ero beat a man there and killed him .
( according to information by survi@@ vors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was also accused of death of the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path that you came in here is also the way on which they came here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were given a number assigned to the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came , that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War@@ riors &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ riors &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was by the military even later , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - became clear to me that war crimin@@ als are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs which one takes to an enemy who has fought for it .

but if one walks into a house and put the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... then it is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it just .
I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to get into a house and to steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
he called me a crimin@@ als and I answered : and you that you asc@@ end to the street ?
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded over anger , and struck me , and cried , saying ,
if you go so far , then will I find you and take you alone .
we need no one another !
this was my father .
I have no one good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ rough pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes at home .
back then , the defence accused me of being a pity on this crime . I said no problem , they can lay hold on me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to test@@ ify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ ous act &apos;
now where I am older , I feel repent@@ ance .
I have children . once you have children , one sees the value of a life .
one develops and recogni@@ zes that it &apos;s wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so good , you were ex@@ ec@@ tively speaking during the dictatorship . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why do children kid@@ nap ?
one day , my father brought a girl with his mother , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - that this was a little girl .
I always imagined the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
you could have just put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families who were handed over to their mort@@ als ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ ous act , which one can do a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and found somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains forever .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the idea of view my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him au@@ dition for all of the atro@@ cities that I had to experience himself because of him .
then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
I felt in@@ viol@@ ated and asked me why all the ex@@ ag@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they allegedly defended , actually was good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horri@@ ble crimes and comp@@ elled me as a child to participate .
he only said &quot; Well , then show me . &quot;
I just did that .
I reimbur@@ sed the first ad in 2010 .
I finally realized that he was a crimin@@ als .
no one can imagine that I am pre@@ judi@@ ced . I eventually quit my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest even before the end of the process .
he was charged with 416 of crimes , including heavy , illegal imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death cases in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under the age of 10 .

on a sign the Japanese word , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , &quot; the older drivers &quot; means , but perhaps also with ar@@ mour@@ n@@ ly back@@ grounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible drivers &quot; translated .
the wrong translation was to be printed on electronic ads from 1 to 20 September at the entrance hall and in the building itself .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . he was also aware of the local time .
the newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable . &quot; said Sherlock Holmes .
the flaw@@ ed English translation was first removed . later , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ fecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore she explained that the mistake had been found in the text that they had received from the trans@@ lators , and that the translation was not tested on their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the exc@@ use :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt ins@@ ulted through the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) for our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set out a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , are very important to worry .
in the Kyoto , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 from a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this represents a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 deaths .
this means that their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused inci@@ dents in the same period has risen .
the nam@@ ing non @-@ mentioned rep@@ orter has published comments on the light published on Yahoo , which show the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
- &quot; Thus does the translation actually not work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation mistake . &quot;
there are no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true place for the bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of trans@@ lators are mani@@ fold .
you need two key skills : passive language skills to understand the text text and an active language skills to broadcast him in the destination language .
the latter demands the active dom@@ ination of the target language - something that is in the case in native speakers . in general , the convic@@ tion that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue should be .
a French native language should translate into French as an example - not from the French to English .

many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language , which could translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of english speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , leave translations even fir@@ ing internally . then the Japanese employees , whose English knowledge will be the best , for trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good .

machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the promising and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by machine translation will show that this technique can still not replace a human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the sm@@ ooth@@ old prints , often used T @-@ Shirts or bags , are used only from sty@@ list@@ ic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors may be acceptable or acceptable as a jewelry , or at least harmless . but of large companies or by the government to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a rep@@ utable source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and c@@ ens@@ ors take on internet and television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet use that they didn &apos;t have access to online channel Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the use of VP@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV will also be no longer accessible .
also other online radio stations carried pictures of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positioning groups who oppos@@ e the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and had transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was tied , and recommended the U@@ sage , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ r : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider are again blocked .
this is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ern with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant since 2014 on the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission threatened to report on t@@ elec@@ oms with cash pun@@ ishments and lock@@ ings if they continue to report about the demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; Call to Viol@@ ence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ s later confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay was un@@ accessible through a lock of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies the website to broadcast the meetings of the National Assembly .
earlier research institutes of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet provider may use DNS to use , through which the DNS servers respond to certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers or ref@@ uses the request when calling a such website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ VP@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
when VP@@ IT@@ V , a third @-@ locked channel , the broadcast was set on Thursday 6th April , when the VP@@ IT@@ V camera was Elvis Flo@@ res , who was transferred to Caracas live in prison .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in police custody .
eight hours later , he was released , and VP@@ IT@@ V was returned to broadcast again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government is also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians will always keep the access to multi @-@ media coverage over current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls become a slave to obtain training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ ad@@ ita as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today Tina has been fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which became exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Ele@@ gance , who will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with the friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , ru@@ ined schools ) , which will be edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices , Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where she did not live together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
those who have become something of something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one den@@ otes the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money out@@ lines its min@@ ers @-@ old son or her min@@ ers @-@ old daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child will receive food , education and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , however , that the children have to pay for a few days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all that can not be lifted up .
as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice this practice is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after graduation , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected things to say , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
they tried to call things by name , as the feeling of gratitude is vacc@@ inated for cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed to be silent in general .
&quot; the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family , who takes the girl with itself and just@@ i@@ fies its exploitation by faith , that they would give someone a chance that otherwise would not get an apprentic@@ eship , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will learn many years later .
sometimes they never experience them .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon that takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in the hospital , her body showed traces of severe blo@@ ws . soon she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military staff Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the residence register .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
Fer@@ re@@ ira pl@@ ung@@ ed until the end of January 2016 with a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of a young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they beg@@ ged that the murder child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were the deeply involved in the practice of the girl Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they described the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered together to protest groups and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations demanded a spe@@ edy study of the Falls .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl whom their cri@@ ad@@ ita was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be proph@@ es@@ ied - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to court .
everyday life of a cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas become explo@@ ited only as labour power , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k worked in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to work , and began to sell , on the street , or on the swe@@ ets , to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of their employers between four and six hours each day .
at the same time , she had to share the time that you still have time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
Fri@@ days for example , they pur@@ ified the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished furniture and des@@ infected the floor .
when the school was at the end she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time was limited , because they had to have dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the refrigerator , &quot; she reminds .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings the bud@@ get@@ r al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and Editorial from Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ ien@@ ces such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; to read .
he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media over the regime of dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would like to get there &quot; bad habit . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , home again to their mother tongue .
they feared your Lord that she had enabled the formation which she had enabled to lose again , she explains .
but you were totally clear that they had paid for everything they had paid for them with their hard work .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was disc@@ rimin@@ ated in the school , too . &quot; a thing about which almost never spoken are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans where cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly well that I didn &apos;t belong to any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
the company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group , where you can share jobs for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s girl in Paraguay .
the Administrator of the group is P@@ EPA Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city center in As@@ unci@@ on district .
Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please login to you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a birthday girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes small children and is very beautiful , &quot; she wrote .
in the third comment , a girl from the Landes@@ ner In@@ ner would like to work . &quot;
then the author started to display once more :

draft bill to pre @-@ register Egyptian users social media , to register with the government
image by Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary groups recently ordered a bill to &quot; regul@@ ate regulation on use and commercial social networks . &quot;
when it is adopted by Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt under a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , then a position would be established in order to provide a permit for social media citizens .
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users would have to register users on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers , to use social networks .
if it failed to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months &apos; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the draft , which consists of six articles and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is going through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video tut@@ orials and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary committ@@ ees and supporters of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ monitor , registered user accounts and users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook block . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . because of them it would be necessary to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on the site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research specialist &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I have a strong impact on the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt for things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they have violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will arrange a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people , and also to bring it to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed under the Legisl@@ ative of Parliament and the Constitutional Complaints before going into the plenary debate .
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind in the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ation will be present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill to vote against Cy@@ ber Crime , in which a life imprisonment sentence was planned for those who claim to rebu@@ ke &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the animal protective H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the Nich@@ tre@@ g@@ ation organization Nature Iraq work to protect the g@@ host@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ type of the bigger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which are aged by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are found because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , because they are always less lo@@ ot at risk .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
how Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining noise in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the thought of the ecos@@ ystem is also dependent on that a large prey is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually can be seen in the free game of wild . hence , when the team appears in the video that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained biolog@@ ist , Raz@@ a likes to show another side of their country , which consists not only from war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies with wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Specialist Group and is committed to promoting protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region .
Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and filmmaker , produced this video for En@@ sia .

in early March 2017 , the progress made in the north @-@ east of Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , which was progres@@ sing in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those who had been hit by the &quot; thre@@ e@@ fold disaster , &quot; a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a kind of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , who had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring countries of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappeared whole coastal cities .
the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows a local view that has been reached six years later in order to re@@ build the life of the local population .
the newspaper &apos;s detailed report includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ organization as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare homes ( fore@@ se@@ man , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , the biggest success of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures were recorded , where 80 percent of the planned replacement stores were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas in the Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened 70 percent of its final light .
however , even six years after the disaster , he evacu@@ ated also six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ n@@ fs@@ chat@@ eau ( fore@@ se@@ ers , Kaz@@ ak@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to the final replacement parts .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in dom@@ est@@ anding .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had been successful in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated products , which have been settled after the disaster in the shelter .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six years later , industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while almost 100 percent of har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ates and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of fisher@@ ies har@@ bors have resumed its operation .
ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have severely affected in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only one episode of the nuclear accident , because only 690 @-@ hectare of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nu@@ c@@ cal locking zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely again , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains far off .
tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima only has 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population being prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper resulted in numerous question@@ ings among the local population and under the evacu@@ ated accounts . she question@@ ed them about the state of re@@ building and also how to find themselves compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to get more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local resident population has taken measures to be prepared for future qu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , there are 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents that still haven &apos;t been done in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
how it is to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture ,
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has increased its attention to the location of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience only the massive earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness to the worst , dis@@ astro@@ phic accident that had ever had to experience Japan .
out of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were transferred outside the pre@@ fecture .
in early 2016 a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement stores .
after the 2017 state , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still living in Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated regions are older than 50 years old . they have to be found in proper dom@@ ination because they have to compete in the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a part of construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people encounter people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , however , one often sees that a more one more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important since they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat topics that can get less attention in reporting as they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to anyone about language and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ ana Eg@@ ar@@ asa speaks about the time that she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back to his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian Activ@@ ist activ@@ ist in the artificial compass , after he was beaten down by police in nation@@ wide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva from a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer struck him while a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a r@@ ammer on the head . nation@@ wide , millions of protest@@ ers participated in protest@@ ers against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás studied , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread quickly in Brazil within a few days .
the face of police officers can also recognize the face of the police officer , who attacked with a demol@@ ition . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian federal state Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his r@@ ammer on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officers were beaten by a demonstr@@ ators and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire op@@ pression would therefore be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video in the net , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary shortly after it hur@@ ts .
another video filmed with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
the clip shown below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , we have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further acts of violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was killed Irish from his father , and here we have been a occupied school with a gas le@@ ck , and here we have been attacked by a police station , after being attacked by a police officer , who has put him on his face .
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to a brutal police force on Friday in the past Friday .
polic@@ emen put on protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had set up a stage for Red@@ ner , Rub@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media tra@@ ps have been for@@ tu@@ cked by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window plate .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a dist@@ al glass window to shape their cover pages with photo .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred the cover story with a bus @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more on a broken window disk than the protests of replacement people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this must also acknowledge , if one is strictly against any form of damage .
here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is a absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are exp@@ elled with the title &quot; protest@@ ers &quot; on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the villages forgotten by the kidn@@ apped ham@@ lets in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central and Spanish sugar mill , regardless of that there is no significant sugar harvest .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the circum@@ stance the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost and after its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changes the work .
others are signed and comm@@ uting every day to the factories , grinding .
N@@ ene , a sol@@ ub@@ h@@ eter@@ an which rises every day at 4 : 00 AM , the crisis in the sugar cane and does not have his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , which are again in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members themselves to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry imp@@ lies the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests have already been no news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane ?
the old railway platform saw better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economical necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories , which amounted to 4 million tonnes .
they only have the factories left to produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane and the sugar rise in the world market .
the sugar level rose again in front of a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO report , agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with certainty , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the construction of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene as he is known as a soldier , talking about the closure of the factory is the word that he is most repeated , &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to receive the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
the first letters began , the first letters began .
it was official survey@@ ed documents which only differ regarding the parts that would be removed , the address and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was sur@@ passed and the letters were increasingly common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the dis@@ counted factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still running sugar refin@@ ery . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the laying of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with each part he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important job producer has been obl@@ iter@@ ated .
in many cases , no alternatives for the work@@ places and services provided in the communities were created , in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present persons saw , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is only extracted high by grinding .
( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the Con@@ gregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich lear@@ nt that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to ab@@ rupt them , they also listened to asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , this dis@@ advantage also other establ@@ ishments .
without work in the region , and with advanced old age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to open other factories .
they were shared to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the provision of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are also impos@@ ing .
in late 2016 , N@@ ene back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , back to the ruins of the place where he began working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty invent@@ ing the old soldier a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a down@@ ward person , yet he gives the lies that you told him not .
they tor@@ tured him for ten years .
N@@ ene is aged 65 years old , not because it is missing on strength , but because it is bitter .

first Nations Youth Min@@ utes use Hip Hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
yo@@ ungst@@ ers of the First Nations @-@ Communities in all Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they are doing hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , since 2014 workshop manager mobile sound studios bring directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were headed by David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e @-@ communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
the workshop is thus increasing the young participation in convers@@ ations related topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ adoption , &quot; or whatever of them coming to sense .
these questions are inspired by songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; at which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely unknown .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a vide@@ osp@@ iel@@ s to conv@@ ey as important to the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people have not always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ k@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation is recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung on Cre@@ e .
the boys involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly by the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip Hop Group who gives them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the st@@ anza is at your disposal as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like that no one would ever be interested in myself
but I try to go on earth for my days
this is the day you will take our cry .
because we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will raise one day .
I do not want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also lead to our youth as well .
thus , they can do what is intended for the Creator

plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , will be found near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sandy pur@@ u ( bur@@ gers , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) from each dish that will be served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic dishes , and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there are a multitude of these small businesses that make up those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so unusual that they didn &apos;t even call them anymore . however , a new trend converts them today into a show@@ y mobile accessory and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ omes , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sandy pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic dishes decorated mobile phones , such as they will be shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects such as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ants for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in Essen@@ ces is becoming increasingly elab@@ orate .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile @-@ stand .
for this three @-@ dish bowl ( lo@@ l ) , we found a good use as mobile phone support .
we also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple containing your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the coma .
some mobile phone support and mobile designer allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura or salmon have been used , a popular tro@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their dou@@ bts :
is there somebody who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members un@@ comfortable .
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and handles made of dried salmon .
further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes you can view at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # ru@@ bri@@ ers &quot; man . &quot;

in reports and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico the missing and killed b@@ ill@@ ets are regularly appearing on statistics . these mirrors , however , are not reflected at all the extent of the human tragedy that brings to this battle .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of Sin@@ al@@ oa , th@@ ron@@ ts the stories of the victims of the conflict absolutely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , barely anyone looking at the mo@@ urn or the churches which have learned to live with pain .
there are behind every body , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds will never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; dealing with drug traff@@ icking live &quot; ) in order to give this victims a voice and stories of people told the struggle between prosecution and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project :
organised crime cannot be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ic@@ kers , and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; like fear life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father and sisters at just one day , lost her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
priest : &quot; like every Sunday , we also prepare ourselves to the task that we have placed us , go and go to graves , for the people we have loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he was supposed to be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentic@@ eship .
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are subject to the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid out because they demand a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a book by Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central and Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form them occurs :
I have known disease and sensitivity journ@@ alism now for some years now .
I pass each day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which actually can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is po@@ unded or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be in@@ different or considered to be normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to be Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ ic@@ kers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is that , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear , that also something happens to them .
I see our weakness , if stories are to block numbers in a statist@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to speak that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months Er@@ pressing in the Capital District : like a family with threats ra@@ i@@ ded . &quot; in this , she describes how armed crimin@@ als destroyed money from their business until they did not only destroy the business , but also their family were torn apart .
you think of everything you &apos;ve lost and about how some people can change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain above never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the other we are apart , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they kill or kill you .
I wondered in these terrible days , if weeping would dissolve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he asks questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , their parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes cooked , torti@@ llas warm and &quot; ch@@ ichi &quot; for the babies who are living with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , she told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years ago when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody grave of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a result of the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the civil council for public safety and the government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors amounted to 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this equ@@ ates to average 8.5 hours a day .
these are only a few hundred thousand stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade them into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is launched in 2015 , whose objective is to represent the complex information behind the failed battle against drug traff@@ icking who has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in an under@@ stand@@ able manner .
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; Sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages to which he is linked , contain pictures on which violence is depicted .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it concerns to lift up a rum@@ our or fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something that emerged in the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , it ten@@ ds to continue to exist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication it was used dec@@ ep@@ tive , supporting trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false script of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not den@@ ies that there are abundant coverage of events in DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place San@@ ge in the East of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , the country &apos;s second largest country had been negle@@ cted for years , and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became too dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to the victims .
the government officials are described by a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinem@@ as in the vicinity , full of people watching the soccer world championships .
houses were scattered and scattered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of that day .
top is an example of this .
it shows rows of hollow body , which are flo@@ ated on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years the same photo was f@@ ished several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not to be attributed to the trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote areas of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically about atro@@ cities , before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch .
many were mu@@ til@@ ated , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up could be depicted .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture of the DR Congo disappeared again , as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this abu@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of ab@@ or@@ tions ; Africa Check has been docum@@ ent@@ aries to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the image has been presented as proof of mass agencies .
yet another step further bring personal comments like this example illustrates the picture of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the painting from San@@ ge occurred also in conjunction with the le@@ thal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash raid , published by the United Nations , those who could flee were strokes , rape and some dead , some through burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , post@@ s like the following arose , which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR of Congo :
this image comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which claimed to be fal@@ sely , the president My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an being said , mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition she had used the picture from DR Congo to interpret this information .
the original contribution , which was picked up on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations , which called AF@@ P as their source , had likewise asked Th@@ an being this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo in connection .
the world wide range of false statements
traces of these false links vary up to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere in the world .
by using a &quot; inver@@ ted picture search &quot; you can see how far information can be crossed .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the Tin@@ Eye search engine has 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images , which are very similar to the picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch private pages , platforms social media and communities as well as national publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , others have attempted to un@@ mask counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have bound examples of abu@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on what page they had been published . thus , we want to display the range more clearly than by the language alone .
several examples of abu@@ sive use can be used from the listed countries below ( which in some cases ) can be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases that can now be completely upset ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
state @-@ examples of the wrong cou@@ plings of the DR of Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
based on pages or servers , the orange @-@ based countries are still available on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ tering .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( established in Alger@@ ian and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

in this post , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City did not only discuss the abuse , but also discuss the abuse of the picture from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions on the Int@@ an@@ ions of Persons and the trage@@ dies ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; EN Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Crist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( In Nigeria she burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the quarter is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica is quoted as his source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( which is not known whether the original report contains the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this here , used the picture of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have clearly seen no pages as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the incorrect use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a Post of the US @-@ American , anti @-@ islam@@ ic comment P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues to be silent in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
this article does not give attention to the per@@ sever@@ ing distress of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quoted the work of an article of Indian Express with the image from DR Congo ; the article of Indian Express had not included the post of publication of this picture .
Greece , 2012 . &quot; dis@@ bur@@ sts ... &quot;

this page used the image as a proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this claim has been contra@@ di@@ cted by a Greek fac@@ e@@ check @-@ page in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a association of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency Nas@@ im and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an abu@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , in part one twe@@ et , the sympathy compared to the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand a blo@@ g@@ gers , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , have been used to del@@ im@@ ble , since the photos of it mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
in Myanmar , the government of Myanmar published an amend@@ ment to what she came to as &quot; deliber@@ ately f@@ aked messages and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments in order to create mis@@ under@@ standings in Myanmar . &quot;
this jud@@ ging which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to f@@ ake pictures of rum@@ ours that are used by H@@ ate Speech , and of extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hist@@ s and circul@@ ate in tur@@ key ( which is often widely used by bur@@ mes@@ ian nation@@ alists ) .

this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , is clear that the picture of the DR of the Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an decre@@ ases in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and the image is still included in this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who were killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declar@@ es that the picture is not written by the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it creates a &quot; similar d@@ y@@ dist@@ ic attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to dis@@ agree that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo di@@ ps , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and on the attack Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that occurred in the name of Islam , a larger attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ath@@ ered for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages that were associated with it were raised in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that had been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Pascal &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre in circulation , it translated discussions like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to Fal@@ se .
from the Embassy in which the picture from DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Martos represented .
there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , ag@@ gregate and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) , Tin@@ y@@ eye also points out , but are not fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time stamps exist on the web cra@@ wler and isolated via image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pull these posters . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second frame uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
religion is to be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth considering how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers do no longer give faith to those images .
with social media , there are less people who are un@@ intended to exercise the water around a tragedy .
imp@@ lies this mood of false and false information that the actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and will decorate the real atro@@ cities of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of non@@ violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the return of images of a ref@@ us@@ al is equal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , concern that violent pictures , readers and spectators des@@ elect and receive the ability to receive emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media act on it to help others ) .
while in discus@@ sing some non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
Techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will have to think thoroughly about the situation where a picture is somewhat suggests , in which a picture can be resolved by the context or at completely abu@@ sive species .
any analysis of false assign@@ ments should also be considered internationally as international .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
camera by Andy Simm@@ ons , in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ readable ) tries to offer language enthusiastic about words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
these words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt to a simple translation .
a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , why a full explanation and sometimes a context required to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog , for example words from the VAT @-@ lap language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ba yourself in recognition of your parents in acknowled@@ ging how it stri@@ ves for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ ric language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or sl@@ oth that you feel after being heated in the sun in cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they dis@@ gr@@ ind other cultures , enth@@ use other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish more of this &quot; un@@ readable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive are these small languages .

how Sri Lanka is surrounded by the worst flood disaster of the decade
the Sri Lanka Island state looks at the worst high water and penet@@ rate catastrophe in this decade .
by the mon@@ soon , which is normally set in late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts have stepped on the banks in the south and west of the country .
following a statement by Sri Lanka &apos;s disaster centers on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missed due to the floods and mud pots .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe stays .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the distances in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene rules of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected area and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos provide an impression of the magn@@ itude of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .

Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods have dev@@ oured the Den@@ ied crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ all are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in floods , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da in G@@ alle flooded the waters of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has made five planes available to rescue campaigns and five are made for transport of emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also been declared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and life@@ jacket dr@@ one for their operations require , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims -
we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .

the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me brought a &quot; High Water Remedy &quot; button , which allowed users to pick up a vehicle to pick up help and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
as well as they performed a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousands of en@@ quiries and 150 successful bo@@ aters for flood and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of government and civil population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring residents into security and afford assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human life , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .

approved in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love .
I trust her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we will call par@@ ole for women &apos;s rights .
in the next step we add rights to trans@@ gen@@ ders .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others col@@ li@@ de par@@ oles against Islam@@ eness .
my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; These things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; I ask .
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they escap@@ es me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practise our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different kind of art . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , like I don &apos;t fit there , will be muscular .
dism@@ is@@ sions to be mixed
I will not stand alone .
this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures come to one in the sense if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as a Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox of Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western imagination , religion was deleted Rum@@ is , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduced images of Muslims , which Western books have been colonial for centuries .
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the one @-@ white American scientist Edward S@@ aid dist@@ ressed the history behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but today these pictures continue to rise today .
they continue our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood .
for thir@@ teen years I worked in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , incorrect Nar@@ rative is domin@@ ating our new@@ s@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rati@@ vely over@@ shadows the reality that have led to their countries in the last three decades , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this fool fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from confin@@ ed their head@@ scarf to public buildings and are forced to cover their entire body through their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
a powerful group does his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ arian weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements to change .
it imp@@ lies that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to an American floor of Afri@@ cans , which were brought along with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this scar is deeply and flaw@@ ed by our collective imagination , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are used to aim anti@@ fung@@ al attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ology .
because of these stories we tell and about the way we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion dollars
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves , which help us understand the world .
and my industry , too , has failed to record the scar of 1,7 billion .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America .
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to immigrants from the first generation , coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my parents decided to live in New York in order to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan was re@@ thinking about the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines , my parents were unnecessary Muslims and Americans .
but am I now ir@@ relevant Muslims and American woman ?

there are hundreds of tremendous Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and religious activists who ende@@ av@@ our to fight well widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ for@@ ged Islamic machine with money , think tanks and experts for false information , which is already a faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is to manip@@ ulate .
because of the stories we tell , and because of the nature we tell them , Islam@@ ist host@@ ility is found in more than just a stranger , who eats the head@@ scarf with a woman .

Islamic host@@ ility in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so spacious , so versatile and complex that it can be impossible to fit into one drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they look back to the following terms : believe , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , see that I am Muslims when it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ordinary ritual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms , and her the Arab verses about protection , which are called Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ s .
I repeat each of them three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one that can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim worship is always part of my shadow .

affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother &apos;s maternal grandmother and her sisters , as she did for decades to win a competition of art of flor@@ ist in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of her that I can see in that moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their complete and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi saint ; and a cor@@ ds with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which can be almost in@@ war@@ dly .
to be Muslims , the prayers had to speak , which she said to me , when I have a bad day .
there is to be Muslims , as she taught me to relate to God : Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation which was founded over centuries - through a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; kol@@ oni@@ alized , which has founded a company with the name of hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning of God to call my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow up and listen that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my own grandfather won &apos;t we@@ ep .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an died un@@ sore for his family in India , he ruled the family that he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palest@@ inians , their families , as with my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists , who have split the Muslim world as the game of risk .
to be Muslims , to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have colon@@ ised all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped from a century above a Muslim country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go back deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plugged story .
it means recall that four years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were spread over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , who went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ s lie buried beneath the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
to be an American Muslims , to know that the suicide rate has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy carries the USA hidden and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story four times more is reported as a story with a white assassination .
it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slave with the name of Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we are saying black lives .
an American woman , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist signi@@ fies the inher@@ ent inter@@ se@@ er@@ ality of our multi@@ colored ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate it to others .
the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branch . &quot; we are &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
to be a mother , to care for my child and to make all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build upon this fol@@ ly of structural enemy .
structural Islam@@ ism consists of the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the Immig@@ ration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that embra@@ ces its borders against people from just the countries that bombs it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely accepts Arab and Muslims .
it is the wars which we lead and the bombs we reject on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientific image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 on evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deep to pro@@ pon@@ der the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we are back for decades to recognise the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ t@@ less and dangerous prints we dis@@ semin@@ ate in our news actions .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to gras@@ p our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video erie Secret lives of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ er Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am worried because of this difficult global time , in which we are .
and this moment has consequences arising out over the 1.7 billion dollars .
there is a reason for consp@@ iracy theore@@ ti@@ cians who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have done Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
for a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now , they conquer large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am worried about the real@@ ities and the story I wasn &apos;t aware of when I was so old as it is now my daughter , but who made me today at an un@@ found Muslim .
things I left here like a baking paper in my speech .
things , perhaps wake up memories , because in all the sec@@ rec@@ tions that make our hum@@ ank@@ ind , a story does l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley find conversation during the 8th Annual Conference on Islamic host@@ ility .
more than a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools to read us or we read in our papers .

we all have to ask ourselves , why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led to us and people through the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public conception , was a scientist of Stan@@ ford for four decades .

initiative for stor@@ y@@ art wants to preserve urban@@ e languages
history tell , by Flickr user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an opportunity , here and now , despite a language barrier to contact someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is possible .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about Steven Bird &apos;s other initiative , the inci@@ ble blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language variety of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in O@@ ak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS had already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project are :
the mass mortality of the world &apos;s languages may be avoided when we do cities , the diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to enter .
while &quot; listening often is often linked to understand , &quot; listening these events instead &quot; listening to feel right to establish . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ telling stories will initially tell their story in their own language and transl@@ ates or declare it in English .
even if the participants are no professional story t@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and their portra@@ yal is that the list@@ eners are allowed to in@@ corporate .
they call laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story nar@@ rator Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou will also take the opportunity to explain the story of the nar@@ rative element of the nar@@ rative element .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the cable of the bun@@ ny and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
having explained the meaning of his mis@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ ct he shares his feeling of inclusion :
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities took place , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the USA Neu@@ en@@ forcement of the State School
on 3 April 2017 , with the aim of a new check out of the public debt of Puerto Rico , several religious and bourgeois organizations involved in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ bic Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old City of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da . &quot; ( civil war for the neur@@ ot@@ ting of debts ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of new debts have also submitted a petition on official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto R@@ ican demands that politicians , banks and government agencies that are responsible for debts to be held responsible for their corruption .
we call for financial examination and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding to the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find out with decreasing pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not integrated in the United States - is suffering from a heavy financial crisis .
thus , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; is an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens danger , to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration was named &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

artist and writer killed the work of the missing Syrian development Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as the Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing since more than one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives put the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has made for an open network .
this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , publisher of Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , blown out excer@@ pts from the book cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ vol@@ e ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective replica ) .
the book , which was released last year and is licensed here , contains a set of essays that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are being built , and what the real costs are linked to those of them .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have page worked to look over the ne@@ bul@@ ae that surrounds our new@@ s@@ feeds in order to make sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and accla@@ imed Internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted out of the A@@ dra prison directory , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in free culture , many of us begin to think about their own f@@ ates , deeds , and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given to this process of extreme beliefs ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police base was based on a &quot; strictly ge@@ heim &quot; command of the military court taken out of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who introduced himself as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death part against her husband .
his place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of creative Commons re@@ active in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in expanding its access to the internet and to know knowledge about the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and moment@@ ary head of the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the kind of cultural prototypes were pre@@ dictive as the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put all this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ en , but the world .
this stri@@ pper set into digital arch@@ e@@ ology and the preservation has created a period of time created for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
Bas@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not close this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and wrote about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and taught me to embrace her .
I am overcome when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read and speak English well .
he always has his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically without knowing they actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel und N@@ oura was working together on the book for a year .
she fli@@ pped the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from the Arabic into English .

it happens during each visit ,
I sing in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the mind at the moment , in which we embrace you ,
that each of the dangers is no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and ke@@ epers
I forget the thr@@ ill of the prison
and I penet@@ rate every detail of your voice and words .
I carry with passion for me ,
if your eyes say farewell
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to cry and smile upon your absence .
I persu@@ aded myself that I will return soon ...

those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed .

Mozambique : after the release of corruption , Mozambique was re@@ acting again to previous post
Muslims re@@ acted to anger with anger , in which a government member , after half his sentence , returned to the workplace of the state machine in which corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other accused due to imp@@ le@@ ver@@ ance of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza in between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately requested his return to the company , which took place on April 19 , then .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which claims the motion for Cam@@ b@@ aza , there would be no obstacle course for Cam@@ b@@ aza , as the company performed no disciplinary procedure after his detention .
however , many habit@@ ants are not good .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to address the director :
provides a back@@ lash in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ back in terms of the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we are aware of , is that the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the states of jurisdiction .
however , the company apparently doesn &apos;t seem to have appropriate legal steps for the use of the corresponding features .
eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well and considered the case as &quot; dec@@ entr@@ al &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza had been an expert type , he would have been a consultant after he was sentenced to one prison sentence , and half of them have drow@@ ned .
he could susp@@ ect speech@@ es and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to become re@@ integrated into the company which he helped inf@@ lic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza gladly pay for his silence .
contra@@ di@@ ct !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the stock of any mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza of the state rewarded , because he ins@@ ulted him I can not believe that someone is rewarded by someone who has so mas@@ sively ins@@ ulted the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the moral and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only serves himself in the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand@@ ing it was a ti@@ ring source of money and the state itself has become f@@ aint , the pre @-@ loaded and finally condemned to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief belongs to prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to remain the first independent president of the Mozambique , but also as a sharp , eng@@ aging and - by the other - proph@@ etic red@@ ner .
one of his most famous m@@ app@@ ings was , when he was energetic , that &quot; an ambitious human being capable of , also the f@@ ather@@ land for his amb@@ itions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is also criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and released .
and today , the company relies on the contract with which he rep@@ lic@@ ates money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - The α@@ et@@ ric International ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to w@@ ron@@ gly
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas or age .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network received its post from the net because they abst@@ ained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian source or generally considered an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot;
the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the ascent of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given an extremely ab@@ or@@ tive con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as an H@@ ass@@ speak against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight H@@ ass@@ ay in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; is usually related to rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not call forth H@@ ass@@ ay .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that in which they have discussed the use of the word or have dou@@ bts about the expression of his usage , cen@@ sored .
in addition , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written to Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( age @-@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way , if he could know how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the set ha@@ u - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that she is going to reduce H@@ ass@@ language &apos;s radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook will be more analytical to spread Facebook before all post@@ its , that would spread to rac@@ ism .
Facebook delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it is fil@@ tering the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what it should do instead , analy@@ zing the post carefully and check it by checking the following words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age @-@ age ) .
the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spread the H@@ ass@@ ay , receive a fairly good lesson .
it is now time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who like H@@ ass@@ ay , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the c@@ ens@@ orship of keywords often have a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , where users can easily start social networks to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the written word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to clear his post when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
ir@@ on@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from content , post and parts of Content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook community did not escape . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of people who have no negative inten@@ tions or simply try to show their views against the H@@ ass@@ talk of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hyst@@ eria :
post without H@@ ass@@ talk about Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more requests before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice :
Facebook may have a beneficial intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
such words will be used only once more hat@@ red within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they start this without a local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; peas cur@@ ry &quot; have forbidden .
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to ber@@ ate the f@@ eit@@ ful post@@ ing .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they compl@@ ained about a large turnover , it would be great .
datas@@ he@@ ets automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has taken care of the user for a lot of fun .
instead of taking serious concerns , users now make fun and write the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in the context of H@@ ass@@ language to see if its post is taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post@@ ings , which contained no H@@ ass@@ ay , but still removed :
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see peas and watch a Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook has the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

screenshot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , which have used social networks to extend their voices and influence .
among other things , H@@ ass@@ language aims to heat the violence in communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ized for his failure , the balancing H@@ ass@@ le on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but instead simply put the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would rather have been more current , looking rather to context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ends with the children &apos;s face
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s date is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided to ban a law that is supposed to ban these practices , so that the he@@ at@@ itude age is 18 .
before this amend@@ ment of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es , there was a large public out@@ cry in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups in the country assembled , that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state that the state does not inter@@ fere with the maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contra@@ cting partner of the UN Children &apos;s Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; defined every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of the children who were already married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and at 18 there were 8,1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 boys in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which were ende@@ av@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s before , followed up at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . without doubt , they helped me to bring this outcome .
however , everything went smoothly .
a Hindu leader , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics of the children &apos;s before they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition provided for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated cause , and eventually came in doubt whether the Opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but in early 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s face - despite the 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where an easy majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against children &apos;s face was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes against it and not only one single against it .
after he has previously decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of social media users had been enthusi@@ ast@@ ically because the laws for the infan@@ cy had finally been changed .
Facebook member , Lov@@ ell Francis , who was involved in the Ministry of Education at the Ministry of Education , said :
it has used too much time and unnecessary talk , which spar@@ ks the heart of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel was in the opinion it was definitely long enough to stop the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come :
public Status update on Facebook of L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : News , Excell@@ ent News !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who list@@ ens to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which was quite openly about it , as important the adoption of the law , noted :
the he@@ at@@ itude of Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years regardless of the religious affili@@ ation .
the design for the change of marriage was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the voting .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were against , have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s stay in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are not allowed by law .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ dil@@ do .
many thanks to all activists who have expressed it .
congratulations .
a thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook is in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said it was absolutely legitim@@ ate when Mahar@@ aj would proceed against the law , most of the social media users would have regard the debate differently .
Patricia Vor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking , in a way we can only talk about the problem that the state will protect the state in our bedrooms , that it may be used by big , hard @-@ driven men that will be ab@@ used to them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ d@@ ations are legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they sign .

through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again .
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA on 18 January 2012 .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month the Turkey has blocked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle @-@ based cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia .
day for day is more obvious how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and writers and fans of TV @-@ series fight against the lock .
although many techniques used are used to use env@@ elop@@ ing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been subject to Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most well @-@ known country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors pages ( pages that reflect the contents from Wikipedia and frequently be updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Pl@@ etary File System ) when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages at its dec@@ entr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ Network ( so machine @-@ machine connections ) which is not supported on the domain name system , so that it does not make a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is call@@ able , however , in spite of legal pro@@ hibition .
in a Blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on Wikipedia from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform so it is possible to read the contents on dec@@ entr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if you cannot reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org website .
IP@@ FS was also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror @-@ source of Wikipedia , and also Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors pages if in the respective country of Wikipedia .
cons@@ onn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open peaks &quot; pod@@ cast :
this is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you are access@@ ing a different URL , which is not the original . that is what you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself when it is blocked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wild@@ card uses his camera to make attention to the need for nature protection
a su@@ hl@@ ous rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around himself , never satisfied . you were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly shaped motives and washed colors .
that motiv@@ ates him a camera to carry and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring to the international stage for Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ als .
and his hom@@ etown right beside the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures , which direct attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife .
he described on Facebook like this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I just rested at home when in Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was found and I immediately began making pictures kne@@ eling ! !
Sag@@ ar stre@@ aves a collaboration with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so terri@@ fying as they look like .
and he should know it , because he stood by face to face to face :
a tiger can not be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also , because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ ffer appeared . he puts up immediately , and we look at me and he star@@ es through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
its passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ as nature and wild animals are not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent in order to make a tiger in Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it lasted until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arri@@ vals .

last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian state O@@ ni@@ a and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives with names .
the tradition also does not call their wives by name , is also common among men . however , they have much less assign@@ ments to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly to the main jump theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , to discuss and discuss the fin@@ eness of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs , who are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is involved in the exploitation of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s homes to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and heads these clubs .
it reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassador of change .
the first video that showed Roh@@ ini in her discussion round , did not speak of women who mention their hus@@ bands .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify with .
the name of her hus@@ bands does not speak out loud , is a custom , which they all have been deb@@ ited and never question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t keep this will be viewed as a list@@ ic , as a woman without mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband , has never been called by name for her , as it runs .
she showed the discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband left for a long time after the video was over .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned back to me and said , I should call him from now on his name .
with this confidence in baggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion loss .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving , and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell us the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that respect us not ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so shy , that while the whole exercise ran only in front of itself ; another decided to turn the fru@@ stration that fru@@ stration to him and his family by cursed him .
the expression of their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
in addition to the ad@@ renal@@ in exchange with an ancient bra , the women decided that she would actually try to call her hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of attendance was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the car@@ eless red point on the forehead that shows sp@@ ouse status :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the chin @-@ red point , if he did it .
he laughed only , and I listened to him to carry him .
the other women have not completely heard of it , but think that they are now in a better position to select himself , not to bear him in some days .
for many women , the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their views and goals .
&quot; we are doing a trip with every discussion group .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I do not want the women to make sure what could hear , &quot; she says .
during the last months she celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and spoke about things about which they never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and I have also about some things , for example like our ident@@ ities attached to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to tell certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is the okay , but some wanted to carry a Sal@@ man Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a pants , they have no dar@@ ed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clos@@ eup , mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ h@@ ed Roh@@ ini in a discussion round , so the women were able to carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will create it .
on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion I have changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are getting slowly into roles :
we have done so far only small steps .
some women tested it a few times , but then they listened to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now contribut@@ ing to any time of Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
women in a discussion club know that changes they want to reach in their lives - like h@@ ash to move more freedom of movement or their own clothing - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but every club of us gives confidence that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club is going home and other people talking about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

one of five men are deported to Mozambique and killed

a new system for kidn@@ apping of sli@@ ghtest people , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , is worried by the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government had called a number of operations to stop the Pra@@ k@@ tik .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently acknowledged that the organs of sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
it giving the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a belie@@ ving man could expos@@ e gold , explained the police pre@@ cher of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that there were succ@@ essive ass@@ aults to men in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of these people for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to a mission accomplished by the UN in the South African country in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government campaigns were developed to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who have prepared to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are traveling to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , war@@ med the Muslim police according to the latest mur@@ der@@ ations of three @-@ belie@@ ving men due to their bodies .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where these mur@@ ders took place .
Hus@@ band@@ Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ burg in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police cover the case already :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of belie@@ ving men .
the persecution and killing of smooth individuals responsible for the profit and sale of their organs in the Mor@@ ov@@ bal@@ a province , for presumably super@@ st@@ itious ritu@@ als , has also taken into account the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also exists that a faith exists , according to whom the victims would have power in mind , the riches of riches .
in recent days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed on Facebook the chron@@ icle by the Blo@@ g@@ gers &apos;s arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty in which Mozambique is facing :
I would like to ask GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique to go to the street , in which the teacher would be ashamed of good notes , work and other services to pursue their bread , a nation in which the al@@ bin@@ os would be ch@@ ased , or even &quot; black magic &quot; to come to the aim of reaching fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of them had no chance to escape macro humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter @-@ users , twe@@ eter that both the boss of the Mor@@ avi@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , and also the Poli@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are inn@@ ed as well :

a photo by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had drawn attention to the international community after being admitted to the hospital in late June after his lawyer had been admitted to hospital in the end of June .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State endanger@@ ing ) , after he calls on the draft of the Charta 08 , a manifest@@ o which claims the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter . &quot; he says it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
however , China continues to grant calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , po@@ ets in Liu X@@ ia , to release or permit him treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ized the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others were completely exhausted from the topic .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
unified nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese civil servants at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu .
but a speaker , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Liu abroad a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister in Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de refused to answer any questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian government stated that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement in order to re @-@ record the salmon progres@@ ses to China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee set his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo .
he was unable to receive his price because of his arrest .
during the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek emergency medical support where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as her release in a statement on June 30 :
we also anticip@@ ate that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet all visits and receive who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans would wish to tell him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in@@ sof@@ ar as it was with his recovery . &quot;
a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary , Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AF@@ P on the 27th of June to release the message of the Chinese authorities not only Liu , but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia free of her house arrest .
the request of the US Embassy was a fur@@ ious answer from China after changing the Ministry of Foreign Ministry that &quot; no country have the right to inter@@ fere and in@@ responsible for Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley dealt with that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom , such as travel health and access to medical care of its choice , which they have established according to Chinese constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife un@@ conditional .
I need China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o to go to a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany in Germany
the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Liu &quot; receives all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters , that China had major concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could be over@@ shadow by Liu the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called to make Liu a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P first that Li@@ us Mrs. , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always super@@ vised the room in hospital and Liu was not allowed to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
Canada calls for China to maintain its international human rights obligations including freedom of expression , to preserve these rights violations in the rights of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Office asked China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons on 29 June .
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , regardless of where , is needed . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that you don &apos;t find any further information whether France will eventually commence .
Taiwan
the Council of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan took on 27 June on 27 June to release Liu and a greater tolerance towards those who want to dep@@ loy peaceful resources to promote political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese leg@@ is@@ lators Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party urged China to allow China to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried in a statement on 28 June by Liu very worried and gave many people to pray for Li@@ us Well@@ being .
he said about Liu :
it is my faith , that the initiatives that he took and had been punished for a more harmonious , more stable and weal@@ thy China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was supposed to be considered as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting during a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because it compared to Singapore with other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has question@@ ed whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , whereby most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to reverse the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ed to create this valuable country , one ceas@@ es to say that we are not in a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a escape from the responsibilities , a duty breach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons led by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ gest@@ ion were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in view of what he seemed un@@ err@@ atic to un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York City ; equally cities which are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old lending of the author@@ itarian rulers take to be the foremost demo@@ cr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , because it fits better to their power .
in the end of the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam , the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests , our youth security , and our political system .
he put appropriate questions with non @-@ answers r@@ ational kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ gest@@ a to clear his mind as it did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our value of K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take out the effort to clari@@ fy this point , if it was paid up to be part of the government of Singapore .
by making An@@ on on the blog posted a comment , it shows on the reviews that you should begin to understand the entire script of the conference , so that you could understand the context of the testim@@ onies of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ gam , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these towns saw a party for decades ? ) .
when he said , Singapore was not a country , obviously he did not understand it in this sense .
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ at , as leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore told you very much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old gar@@ de that awaits me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s a different thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have dou@@ bts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes that he really believes that he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK review over@@ lays the weak spots of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
does Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; have sinned a mistake , or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ or spokes@@ man ?
when Singapore is not a country , we are considered independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , what country are the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within government cabin , the say@@ ings of Lord Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ gam are of severe significance .
why do the Singap@@ ura make their military service , but defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink human resource ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to affir@@ mation , Singapore was and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have a lot of Singap@@ ura more angry ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island country .
I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , above all , &quot; etc , but that is not entirely correct .
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors revealed through certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I reply then . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in his team of conversation by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication then follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook in front of anger if they are kept for Americans but does not bo@@ ther me .
for anyone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us by Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well visible to her backpack when travelling .
all love Canadian .
Americans however ... .
it was so , when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before the invasion of Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th of September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always wore small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gay mar@@ ri@@ ages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is supp@@ os@@ edly considered the toler@@ ant country toward ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends who I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t make me anything if you would like to conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot; nice . &quot;
first , called &quot; nice &quot; means to be in essence - like the gut@@ sive , soft , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
when Canada was really a nation of full people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; cute &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing at which one can change .
harmless to be harmless , to be in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and in@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
this can be something good when you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from things that happen around one .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , a prime minister of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own business .
what outdoor standing can be called &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans aren &apos;t talking often about the fence across the neighbors .
we lack the warm heart@@ ed , open kindness that I connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada heavily sexy .
music video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ zed Thai Jun@@ ta
a music video published in Thailand has published a music video which took the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ c , which took hold of power in 2014 , and to restore civil government in 2014 .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ ils Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what direc@@ ts him his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , music video refers to the prolonged military dom@@ ination of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video loaded on Facebook was given up to 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin video , &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists turned to the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics , notably as it is with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
watch the video of the video , which relate to some of the political issues , have followed in Thailand in the last three years .
the &quot; 44 &quot; rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which are given to the Commander of the army , absolute decision making concerning important national themes .
the 11th rule : &quot; change Your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; sub@@ ordination &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to ver@@ ge activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitors the online content and people who have thrown into being monarchy is prosec@@ uted .
Thailand establ@@ ishes a strictly speaking against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty s@@ ins@@ ult ) .
the War of War was proclaimed in Thailand on 20 May 2014 .
two days later , it came to a coup .
one of the problems that Jun@@ ta continue to purchase is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts they were warning that the purchase is unnecessary and waste of tax @-@ control .
in the video will even be shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before taking them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and cause Internet users to cur@@ b long prison sentences , they should ins@@ ulting the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs of the band called the Sal@@ ut &quot; Tri@@ bute from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost cities in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , first published on the OC Media website , published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society covers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern suburbs in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the hydro@@ car@@ park of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ preci@@ ation and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ v@@ ases live in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called ghost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war era even more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these viol@@ ins .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 had grown to 16.000 people after it had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a result of war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ k@@ ow@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically for the decline and desol@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ ired and quite rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a local elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t you talk ?
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with remaining splend@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and with their contribution to the central plan@@ ing economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district meanwhile .
around fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which is still one or two families , one sees the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they dis@@ covering me with the camera in his hand , they re@@ tire immediately .
&quot; our Mother is forbidden to make us a photo , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers a little bit to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the farming industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetables .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district management provides free candles and bread on their villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ gett@@ es &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not have to leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she told her .
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial aid by her daughter , and in@@ sist@@ ed that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ ati@@ ans monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s hard to survive , &quot; she is too .
aun@@ t G@@ alya is telling that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate public holidays .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if you are holidays , we will visit us .
but we cannot do this - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls for T@@ ante G@@ alya . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ gett@@ es .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ gett@@ es . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talks in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they re@@ members the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply gone ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it .

her husband is working in the cab@@ bage .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s Kinder@@ garten once was at once , she kept pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .

many people believe that this buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it actually has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was little work and all lived like it was right .
I remember each day , as the city and the war were once . &quot;

in Mexico houses &quot; Mama Africa &quot; lived on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
this article by Amy Bra@@ ck was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and will be published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , where he is on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year old Mexican female , a small woman with a cor@@ allen @-@ pink frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet , they know many of Mama Africa name .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel rather has no charm .
for approximately 2,50 Dollar the night sleeping in simple rooms , with grinding , ab@@ ov@@ able walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - still hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an immigrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast begin to call her : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present , it &apos;s more quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on ant@@ ons outside .
she does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medication that they could not pay , they mass@@ ed them with a bal@@ m that exhaust@@ ive from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yoghurt hat ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it fits to it because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States , normally make a first stop in South America and then go to the north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest of Haiti .
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel the way together and that Afri@@ cans speak already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest for M@@ um Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; we will always be in touch with us . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send text messages when they are gone to report them or to report her over the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught to prepare the chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is very well known here , but she is not the only spar@@ king hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their little home .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ ick@@ ets have to be sold too expensive to numerous African immigrants .
he started to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on the ground floor , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his office from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who had fled from him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single one he has offered her roof .
a few months later the family lives again and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the House of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , the travelers keep calm their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it &apos;s also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone .
like a proud grandmother , she hides her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ pin which you made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many trav@@ ellers , boy and elderly .
she laughs , while she imag@@ ines her briefly .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ er@@ one , &quot; repeated them every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , the fore@@ man &apos;s fore@@ man .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone received a mobile phone in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi . in which she att@@ ends the District Government to install a monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the message , the app is said to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
however , the authorities will also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture because they had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app with a private We@@ Chat Group .
in the press release , the app was able to determine and track the sources and distribut@@ ing paths of terror@@ ists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ ing website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a service provider with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , of online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users alert , how much time they can spend online and to remote control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors will help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote &quot; remote actors &quot; or even h@@ ack@@ ers could manip@@ ulate the home network of a person or steal from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while news on digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , displac@@ ed ethnic min@@ orities like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme cen@@ sored and surveillance measures as well as regular Internet connections .
this is based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; Images from The China &quot; ( fore@@ se@@ man , fore@@ man ) , the cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where the polic@@ emen were able to check if they had the monitoring app installed .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they are forced to use devices that are intended for older people to use .
this is a form of captivity through the observation technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from the China &quot; ( fore@@ man &apos;s fore@@ man ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can highlight the password requirements of a Windows operating system and therefore un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minimize prolifer@@ ation of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and the party related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , up to 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards . &quot;
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this action viol@@ ates personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ishments for a whole range of other possible clubs , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death

this is the first of six reports in a row of &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane has posted its experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you are looking forward to you and you are sure that you are entirely alone in one place where everything has disappeared .
everything has come after and after dis@@ b@@ anded and a truth revealed , which is clearly recogni@@ zable both from inside and outside .
one who makes all honor her name .
one who has settled in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions , do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you bring your reality back and look behind the scenes , beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - transform the characters into being of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all dou@@ bts dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of the evil one . you will clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them have established your grand@@ parents , stone by stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he exhibited his power over us , by even destro@@ ying the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers have been ri@@ pped during a peaceful protest , such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough so that the city crossed the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the quarters were cov@@ eted , but not my own .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy days , even if I had no high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little re@@ ass@@ uring , after the power supply stopped in the quarter .
I broke through the silence by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice with@@ h@@ all the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to meet together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed to me ; we al@@ lied to a glorious image that filled my expectations full and full .
in such a moment , you are aware that you get the spirit out of the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care in the least .
I received a call from my father : &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you gave it all the way up to the office of security from the body .
I joined there .
the Colon@@ el Gh@@ assan stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
the Colon@@ el Gh@@ assan begins to speak : &quot; let me hear how you cry &apos; All@@ ahu &apos; , or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not nearby . &quot;
his hat@@ ch@@ filled eyes were set up in me .
&quot; and you know what to look for me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then , has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure as I said : &quot; I would not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is the same with us . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition lies down to me in the nose today .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; an Irish torture that I was exposed to months .
I pier@@ ced the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the single cells .
I im@@ print all the details exactly before I super@@ vised the room .
unlike otherwise , they probably have dealt a bigger cell this time .
I have to share them with just one another prisoner , and may immediately sit down without waiting its permission .
after some minutes , who felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I grab@@ bed an old proven communication method : with his f@@ ist against the wall .
I knew that my sigh@@ ting was a &quot; wh@@ om@@ el@@ ling . &quot;
after a long time , he ultimately answered me .
apparently in any of the surrounding cells there was a respected man of middle ages , which looks similar to me and &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness there is no striking faces of mind , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ators had assured me , they would love him if I remain .
liar .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to drive all these c@@ rows that lab@@ elled towards the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu &apos; Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be at approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cry of scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that the colour of the per@@ dition is , until I saw the yellow light that provided us the hor@@ ror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; playing on the 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
thus the secret was to protect and prevent the state security from us , and to prevent the tra@@ itor and terror@@ ists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect - so they played their conf@@ essi@@ on@@ elle vom@@ iting ticket and locked the close eye view of their world view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I manage the listening room and meet to Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to get acc@@ ust@@ omed to it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws after a friendly conversation for me become a usual communication tool .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to be acc@@ ust@@ omed to be punished , although I had nothing done to earn this penalty .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear down as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker rejo@@ iced at your scre@@ aming .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you and you can &apos;t stop your cry .
my cry was not enough for him , why they had to divide the tube through a cord .
during my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ators had worked as a garbage collection once or if it belonged to the normal work of work .
they had twi@@ sted four cables to each other , to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them changed , while I was still at the turn .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I ceased to scre@@ am .
the head@@ sman noticed the cooling and found no danger to it , which is why he grab@@ bed next to an electri@@ cally charged rod .
river flows through my whole body , enough to store my whole quarter .
my half @-@ bodied body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect ra@@ cket .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to fall asleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and be@@ g you , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends the most of his times inside . once again he shu@@ ffles to his computer , go to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what one can leave , is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nic@@ ot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
he lives in the top of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and had forced to flee from their village to Palestine in which she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
since six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who is the conservative daily opposed to the conservative majority , and she asks about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rap@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as a man who is not restricted in his mind , and he can feel according to his own statement with people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not supply it openly , it swe@@ eps against the US foreign policy a special dis@@ like .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b believes not that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian favor of the second generation , &quot; so he himself was born even if he was born in Jordan , and so far he was never in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life circumstances , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while living in water over two cups , it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public eating is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sel@@ ing hot young woman has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the mu@@ g@@ inity l@@ ur@@ k coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of the k@@ ent cigarette in the nose into the first place of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one throws a look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore , one avo@@ ids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - in order to land not in prison .
recently , the Interior of the Interior of Jord@@ an@@ iens has cancelled a performance in the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary groups that support the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ing that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual fron@@ tier Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , has contra@@ dic@@ ated the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert .
the MP and former press @-@ press officer of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singers have been cancelled .
in addition , many pret@@ end , the commitment of the band in matters of Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be dangerous ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m that author@@ ise the old legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimates the Jord@@ anian people as a progressive supp@@ orter of human rights , who still decided to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply sil@@ ky rh@@ etor@@ ic , but in fact an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality reflects in Jordan that occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b used traditional gender equality by forming his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vo@@ re@@ lied sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an exposed unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually have confidence .
over the past years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; hon@@ ours &apos; - the un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch , according to its cul@@ mination , reached its peak in 2016 . however , Jordan was added to the institutional infrastructure that Jordan has become an institutional or domestic violence that tried to assist murder or domestic violence .
according to a law in breaking out of the year 1954 , women who are exposed to danger from domestic violence , &quot; for her release is often a lon@@ gl@@ ong bureau@@ cratic effort , as well as the guarantee on the part of the family , that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for it , also not fri@@ gh@@ ten on themes that remain in the country for a long time .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , he is dre@@ aming that he does not separate his music , which is full of explic@@ it concerns on sexu@@ ality , freedom and freedom of expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come out of the Middle East , man .
he became a reflection of politics , &quot; he says .
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically active in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats many times :
&quot; you are free , and every other is also . &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words , &quot; which you want , &quot; be faith or not believe H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya to mem@@ ori@@ ze that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and his opinion had been cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a modified version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ qui@@ res the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance against homosexu@@ als is not speaking to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in mind thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ is supposed to work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do it ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought into silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian newspaper service adopted several former government officials and members of the course of the association , with the reas@@ oning , they could have expressed themselves in social media in the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country .
in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs said only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is a permanent giving and taking . Jordan has now denied a performance for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ rock and internal changes . it is sure that changes from day to day will take place at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also dreams of an Arab world without inter@@ ventions abroad .
he dre@@ aming not only to bring his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem , and Damascus , but also of them , &quot; they are experiencing . &quot;
perhaps the region will be ann@@ ul@@ led by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , spreading and artificial nature . at least he hopes it .
until it &apos;s done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually taken in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory says that the Fest@@ ing invaded the east of Japan in the armies of the west of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seating , so we have a super vision .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , held a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally t@@ l .
I have been looking for a long time again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two st@@ rollers are straight ahead .
however , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of an 18 meters high fixed car was amazing .

rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this history , because they help to keep Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair of hair .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us , most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ b and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 per cent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , has led to more normal brushes in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , who can recre@@ ate these elab@@ orate hair@@ styles .
an exceptional demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts stand against each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric l@@ ooks that can be seen in the following video ( more videos about current cont@@ ests can be found on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions , such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice to find training in hair@@ dressing , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities you &apos;ve seen dozens of young people that they can take a job is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year , and reported on some of their successes :

Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the message &quot; declaration of gu@@ err@@ illa &quot; to have published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the post is published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write letters to people we know ?
is there not much more important , people who feel e@@ jected to bring affection ?
exactly this question went out to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Fort@@ ul@@ aci@@ ón ( letters for reconciliation ) that encour@@ ages young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa letters .
only recently , her country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to do their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the Guer@@ ill@@ a@@ movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but the colum@@ bi@@ ans is still a long way , until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who have lived for many years in illegal camps , exposed to war rh@@ etor@@ ic and around the clock carried their weapons with themselves , must now be back into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which in turn to life in fear and in some cases , had acc@@ ust@@ omed to their ranks and in some cases , it must now support them in their ranks and support them in creating a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to close together and help the integration process .
and exactly this did they do : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - message messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa ships to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa war - which should then be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was made on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak short with Kail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those who need to do much more .
he plan , in this year he told his love to share with people who needed most urgent action .
thus the plan , letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now have to place their place in society , and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a military story with a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would forgive &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to deliver letters personally .
members of the F@@ ARC appeared as they used to take the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands , but letters of full support of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that is in between , &quot; told the policy scientific student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of Guer@@ illa fighter .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ err@@ illa movement ) saw , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa who wrote somewhat .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ rower , a le@@ thal weapon in the bush .
and I said , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing now ? &quot; he said , &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something like nice , so I answer it . &quot; I suddenly started tears over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him whole and sat down beside the Gran@@ at@@ cher .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something else from life expect@@ edly as war . to join the F@@ ARC , it was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the hunger strike . &quot; I had never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a society without waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together as a discussion round .
the students were all raised as war and the F@@ ARC had already been in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insights into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how the social in@@ justice due to evol@@ ve into a political party , we can help to make the society more fair@@ er in this country .
for a purpose of this magn@@ itude , it pays to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people , who had never heard before and had no electoral law , and to recognize that the people I had often seen as a monster , even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their lives and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , wo@@ e to me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who killed and have caused so much harm to give us a little and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the colum@@ bi@@ ans was proph@@ es@@ ied that after the dis@@ arm@@ ament , peace would prevail .
but this is not the case .
long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are willing to raise up to the weapons and to protest their rights , and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those under us who defend life as the basis of existence will gain many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a vast range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
their hor@@ rors have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on the LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not just over the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after the reports were published , which have been them@@ ati@@ zed torture , torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , cap@@ turing the suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and grew up there .
ever since childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender equality of their land@@ lady , hunting was opened to Sabrina .
in fear about her life she moved to the USA .
Sabrina : I worked as volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day , someone told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can solve this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents went through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the round .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was doing just a few grocery bags from the back seat of my car I heard a male say : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still honor the family ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up the last end at the hospital .
apparently , some women had taken everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two s@@ words in my right lungs .
OC Media : in which cases were they laid - in men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name ; but the doctor understood and laid me down to the women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
I got threats to last February .
they called me , and wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a trau@@ ma .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the requested to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that this was all a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it , and I say that I didn &apos;t change my sex in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and I say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad things , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic .
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother got too much and she put a sn@@ ck around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , a car with a dar@@ kened window plate and a plate plate with a 95 margin .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something lazy .
my human rights friends checked their license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unexpected happened .
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registration , without reference , without identification , without everything .
I broke down my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
came and check in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you believe in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people know already , in which hotel you plug . you even know your room number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this really was my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and sisters .
we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , however , that is a tab@@ u@@ subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome these se@@ el@@ ic barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person from her past - thus in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who are d@@ ord@@ ed ?
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who gave one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan , he was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
that I mean , they probably charge the relative , they take care of the problem with the person affected and at the end demand an evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood .
OC Media : are there still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there would be no many .
if , then , above all those who have no weal@@ thy relatives or were dropped by their relatives to put the cad@@ y@@ rows of court .
as far as I know , they will be held there to present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they allegedly attacked some village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people weren &apos;t just van@@ ished , but sub@@ ordin@@ ated specifically to radi@@ alize yourself .
OC Media : is that just a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I was doing someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after her be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was with us when these people were taken .
until now , they were not introduced as band@@ its , but there were no reports about that . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why else could it not be allowed to shave these people ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe I was already known already in the year 2003 when I was still living there - and I had never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I had never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization , &quot; but ultimately led us back to the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were kno@@ cked ; I had colored eyelashes , kept tu@@ b@@ je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria had never conf@@ essed me a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and all the city knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen Language there is a Rede@@ mp@@ le : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ ot is not on the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say to children , when people make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just have her eyes closed to you because they believed they were sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted me , never hun@@ ted and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did this grace period end ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about mor@@ als .
he spoke not about us by se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , you could feel like the people in the city started to change .
those who suffered and laughed before and laughed at once with Ar@@ g@@ osh .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic has steadily deteri@@ orated .
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the United States .
apart from that I am still active as activists .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gath@@ er@@ ings , I talented them to the hospital and help them to get food types .
I don &apos;t spend any p@@ enny .
I discovered this man myself when I kl@@ ap@@ ed them .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you have a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s it .
so , nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who wants to hide you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no co@@ ils with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans who have the cab@@ in@@ ers who have the Russians have also who , on the entire planet , are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque and fasting throughout the Ram@@ adan , live together with men .
do you know , many think in Tran@@ si@@ dent@@ ism of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different habit@@ ats .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase in self @-@ moral within the armed Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arabian population .
for the past few months , there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : usage with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called Jas@@ mine Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , influenced by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness that can arise in@@ competence for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ human rights groups that are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube took the moments when he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly put the flames back , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani @-@ Hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that has acquired himself in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists on site war@@ n that more men could get their lives .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Man@@ i@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to nour@@ ish their family because of the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to pursue their families .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is based in a large part of Iran @-@ based Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to deny the native Arab population .
in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was primarily autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z , there are some of the largest in Iran occurring oil and gas fields as well as some of the most experienced and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives only little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disorders , hunger and de@@ duction .
the Iranian regime uses the ancest@@ ry regim@@ es systematically in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a multitude of dam@@ s , the waters from the Arab regions in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are running .
these dam@@ s have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region through d@@ rought caused destruction , and local agriculture as well as fish and palms .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi yo@@ ungst@@ ers now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operative , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is concluded a job , completed the primary school , 55 % have completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy that aim to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Ken@@ im@@ i , an Iranian nuclear activ@@ ist , resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; said to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ moral among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men .
Ken@@ im@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse and worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process :
as officials and institutions not prefer@@ ed to the Arab forces , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will sub@@ side access to work opportunities in all sectors .
it is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aim to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside of their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the given circumstances , the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi alone must endure , strike human rights activists , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait if the world is w@@ aking up and informed of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , as well as with the inter@@ se@@ duction &quot;
detail of a photos . recorded by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who themselves describe themselves as an inter@@ disciplinary femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even put well through scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women today still earn less money than men , despite the same education .
that women still stand under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling earlier or later in various fields of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still passing through the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of that and I suffer twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I &apos;m a black woman .
and yet , if I have to speak on skin color , on black c@@ is women , on black trans@@ si@@ ft women , to black trans@@ si@@ ft women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I mention , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but all of them are , however , that women - all women - come together to &quot; sing their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) women .
but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence that we are exposed to black women in two times .
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ ers and spending less deserve as white men and women .
that black girl and girls are more often referred to in school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spher@@ es and women with mig@@ rant background to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all the men and all men of any kind of skin have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join as black women , who refused to consider in@@ just@@ ices in their thinking , which relate to gender as well as skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m tired and I &apos;m not going to fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spont@@ ane@@ ity that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
in her speech in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner mour@@ ned in her words : &quot; I am not a wife ? &quot; and I also ref@@ uses to maintain a ide@@ ology where the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature .
I feed myself to connect group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs of customs , to push their eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to settle white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin color and gender . because some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to ins@@ ure them for better .
although the inter@@ se@@ ct@@ arian femin@@ ism was founded to stop women of various approaches and differenti@@ ate from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I draw it to me full and entirely of femin@@ ism , who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman in my life instead of a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ se@@ ag@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and embar@@ ked on us in the spher@@ es which we are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves , in which they are perfectly safe , and in which the cultural , mental , se@@ el@@ ic , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped .
although some white and internal femin@@ ists are immediately called Separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , please inform you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can feel black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I am acknowledged because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life has not over@@ looked , nor ignored , nor denied .
Pad@@ del@@ ing against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again , in the past 7 years , Mai@@ Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with a surf board or a special request by the Kurdistan Kurdistan in Iraq . its mission aims to deliber@@ ately make people &apos;s importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region , and the impact of pollution to its church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells us .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - who is involved in protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a explains the ur@@ gency and importance of his work together in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
the video was filmed and edited by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the emphasis of their work lies on the pursued , little considerable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by using co@@ operative video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities that can tell their stories in their way .
anger women and its difficult fight against violence

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the number # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ref@@ lich@@ ein@@ ous ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the persons affected .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could not do anything against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ ams that would have been violent against it .
since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police said , their statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
when a further woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , also the accurate display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was useful .
a few days later , the second woman went back her ad .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women may reimbur@@ se any ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on the men that they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence is at all to report to the investig@@ ative authorities .
In@@ de@@ 1 blo@@ ws and statistical abuse and a legal system that has nothing underground laws : good approach , lack of action and statistics
it is hard to see how many women truly har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a researcher in scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports which , however , do not even accum@@ ulate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
the figures available at disposal are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General has registered 9@@ 600 ads due to domestic violence . at 70 % of them it went around violence against women .
86 % of the advertis@@ ements came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence at the peace courts . here 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the indicators , 40 % of women claimed that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
these statistics , however , show not the true sever@@ ity of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these off@@ ences will actually appear . &quot; on each woman , who will not be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
on any woman who are charged with physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; commented at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s mur@@ ders in Paraguay has no own off@@ ense , the investig@@ ative authorities cannot appropri@@ ately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , a woman dies in Paraguay every ten days due to violence by men .

un@@ seen mist@@ re@@ acts and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was born the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he in@@ sist@@ ed that she called his name of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she should rep@@ ent .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . however , she bore the mental violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and simultaneously the most notable :
I never thought that I would once be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I thought that this only happens to sub@@ jection to women , because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked the rh@@ etor@@ ic if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long from Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , who comes not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay in order to prove that their former partner fought them .
Victoria is a member of the network of Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) , which consists of women all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk with others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Victor@@ ias case everything began with psychological abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to strike them .
Victor@@ ias Advert@@ ise with the authorities without the result and also of their relatives , she received no support .
it led a law@@ suit against her former partner who developed into a continuous legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country , mainly for money , power and influence of its former partner .
world laws : good approach , defic@@ ient implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not applied .
the ad of abuse is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also provides great problems with the laws of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # Für@@ ess ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the motion # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ inclu@@ sions ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks forward to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent crime @-@ continu@@ ance and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
so the stat@@ est@@ ext was changed in some points to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of ab@@ or@@ tions that are currently forbidden in Paraguay and are punished by up to five years in prison .
the original bill had fore@@ seen , the majority of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) process of process that the victims of violence have to bear in mind , if they just want to refund and receive a secure accommodation to impos@@ e the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator has no sufficient financial means available for this purpose :
in Paraguay , abuse are seen as part of human relations .
here , a circum@@ stance must take place so that violence is not considered something normal .
those who are silent in view of these facts is guilty , and carries with that the perpet@@ rators cry out .
we must restore so long until abuse is not considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law were altered , but among other things , a passage was painted , which the partners had called domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was considered an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victims again .
the cancellation of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law applies however as great set@@ backs .
this article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the number # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ref@@ lich@@ ein@@ ous ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .

independent Media in Oman one year after pro@@ hibition of a newspaper remains exposed to attacks
&quot; this website was locked due to a decision by the information minister &quot; on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than a year ago , the Cuban authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to its coverage on corruption in the Sult@@ an@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried by court , but came back later .
Oman has been re@@ igns since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state of coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ ans reign is characterised by the persist@@ ently effort of security forces , in particular of domestic power , including freedom of freedom , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and further activists , in@@ timi@@ dated and imprisoned .
the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ dering citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs as such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , the closure and the arrest of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , where since its foundation in 2007 was reported about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces took place Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , who was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands on the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; in this , we went to corruption in the judicial and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of lifting the judges of the Supreme Court of Oman , to raise the judgment in a inheritance .
Edition of Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , zah@@ n Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , was invited to the special department at the ISS before and upon arrival of the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew the Deputy Editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was ag@@ itated after Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris arrest as chief editor .
the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite period after the Information Secretary had given the order , &quot; the publication and spreading of the newspaper on any way , including online , as of August 9 , 2016 is forbidden . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in the trial of the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Tribunal sentenced three journalists to prison and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of inter@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; Sub@@ si@@ ent of the Pre@@ par@@ ation of the State . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of an audience and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and an old professional ban imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1,000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) , after the use of an information network for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ ial ( 13 000 US dollars ) was priced and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgement of judgement .
at a hearing held on 26 December 2016 , the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after exp@@ ulsion of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Court of Appeal over@@ turned the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
in spite of the decision of the court to reg@@ ain Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper looks like before attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January the Information Minister made an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and where@@ with the Minister set up again for the decision of the Appeals Court to publish the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has recently been injured in Oman .
for example , the closing of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad include the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up its operation .
due to the lasting closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Cuban authorities are still not prepared to make an end to an end of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Cuban authorities on :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ conditional release ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists may follow their work ;
3 . to protect press freedom in the country
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered human rights of human rights un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting Mein@@ l and association and the right to gather peace@@ fully , supported and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ standings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the need of medical research , there are two reasons : for the demand of the global health sector there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines covering the special medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa have far more severe effects than elsewhere , and missing investments in the discovery of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists itself , is capable of establishing own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
it grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the news about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ish national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion of the most important scientific issues in your country and commonly in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we just set solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being mur@@ ders .
solutions that we get are often not suitable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the funding and support come from ?
is she sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special science education starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research for world trau@@ ma , health care ( not transfer@@ able and inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the given access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here .
the system that magazines are only available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; producers change world @-@ wide food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding the salad of the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as out@@ sh@@ red@@ ths , the first plant grown by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more Sal@@ ate was patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only available for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or wrapped leaves .
over the last years more such patents have always been registered for growing plants such as cereals or cartridges . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food safety for food security to the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mort@@ on is still growing , but it is now longer needed since its work will always be worth more restrictions .
&quot; it &apos;s as if I lie in a river a b@@ oul@@ ders , so that I must d@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new oint@@ ment , because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tried to breed those features that he would like .
however , it is very c@@ auti@@ ous and stri@@ ving to use no material , which is protected as intellectual property .
it is also connected to a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ edings ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred and eaten red tu@@ red@@ oms in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; variety and ate . it is tested , whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement origin@@ ates from the IT field , and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , the alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was created in life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US bre@@ eders are able to agree that others may use the far@@ med seed freely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seeds and the possibility to breed new plants as well as food security and environmental protection .
seeds are according to it , according to biodiversity as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by bre@@ aching seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; to achieve the most common examples of organic farming or Monsanto and Bayer , which is also offered on farming markets , should also know that the way that this vegetables is bred , is threatened .

Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted , in@@ cess@@ antly corrupt .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and availability . she found out that about a third of all card characteristics is protected as intellectual property , which makes it impossible for plant bre@@ eders .
for other plants , there are not such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that foods such as wheat are patented as wheat in even greater style as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ ions
plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such , through which its taste or color improved to such , because they prosp@@ er in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decreasing by more than ever more patents . genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever before , as the changing conditions are much worse than ever before .
in an email spokesperson for Monsanto , Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto is recogni@@ zing that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ ban@@ gles and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company is responsible for maintaining the genetic variety .
however , it contra@@ dic@@ ts that intellectual property re@@ tren@@ ch other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varied Innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken into a plan that can abide by as soon as the patent has exp@@ ired .
often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same outcome .
thus , such protection is not in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but encour@@ ages more material and know @-@ how to provide the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years of waiting for a patent that is certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to grow to plants , which have been adapted to the changed environment conditions , one would have lost the fight already .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources should always have been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us .
we want to help farmers to make their job easier .
that is what drives us , and it will be impossible if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on inter@@ fer@@ es with the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the features .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ eds a variety , and raise its own values into them .
who believes in industrial agriculture with great farms and mon@@ oc@@ ulation , for their cultivation of cultivation her@@ bic@@ ide are needed , which is cultivated in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is just opposite . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who operate on international markets but smaller than Monsanto &apos;s ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either refuse it to be expensive and therefore keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant @-@ owned Frank Mort@@ on seeks to look for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ ents would be innovative : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented .
I need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors have to sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years before the competition , with which in my opinion it simply makes it quite beautiful . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seem to be a leader in the Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , a &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed programme is working together with farmers and helps them to grow new varieties which meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell its own .
the German Organization Agre@@ ements are working on an Open @-@ Source Code , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , absent because of the Os@@ si obligation not simply can be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive branch of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventional discipl@@ ined plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
but a statement is not yet a law ; now it is in governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seeds , NGOs and seeds from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to cultiv@@ ating seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems declared that the organization is currently developing a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems which should be planned for planned next year .
a merger between environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed @-@ map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report that farmers have to be able to exchange and improve seed politics , making it possible to share and improve the seed policies , so that a stable supply can be ensured using food supplies .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is also st@@ resses - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si , hopes it will see it soon .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and as something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time the site of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend of August , the Egyptian government locked up the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network released a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step sharp@@ ly and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first zen@@ ly site of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites like e.g. the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to Egypt &apos;s blog and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog was built to handle the zen@@ ge of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which the destination of Zi@@ adas blog is native , but is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and took a video that carried out physical violence against two students .
his article revol@@ ves mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the lock by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ally al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs is probably not important for the world , it is for me it is for two reasons :
1 ) It happened to them to mediate the feeling of an siege of an siege ; an attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the lock blogs , and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even though only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to item articles to deal with c@@ ens@@ orship .
but now , having blocked him , and that they may be afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented barriers of providers by changing online c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so called Virtual Private Networks ( VPN )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites , which we offer VP@@ N@@ s .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content to the Egyptian user .
in addition , the situation is intensi@@ fied that the cen@@ sored decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed to the court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day for tag newspapers in whole Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard pictures .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Each second day a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ ie@@ ves &apos; pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , marine and air force to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a sharp financial situation , the violence of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian No Global Justice organisation called for even the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; you will find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
thus , for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they agreed to set up a new column called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for her decision declar@@ es the paper :
extra will continue to report on crime that happen in any major city on the world , like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ ality loss , etc . all , which happened in Rio , will be published in the column &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so we do not close our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ editor of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist discovered that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the edit@@ orials the newspaper writes further :
we are aware that a war course , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to shift cru@@ el@@ ines of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose purpose is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; har@@ ms longer than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for human beings .

source : Can@@ do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 , and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib in a state of siege .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack of chemical weapons in August 21 , 2013 , is particularly affected by hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights of human rights that massac@@ red the massacre of the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebels have stood under siege under siege under siege under siege under siege under siege under siege under siege and instructed by tun@@ nels and control points .
by years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
in contrast , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta as they can plant their own fungi as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they themselves call themselves gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ low@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fungi not belong to the traditional , in Syria planted food products and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the direc@@ ts of the project , Abo , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for the project for three years , and expressed its relief , that it is now more and more &quot; awareness wins . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do .
it is planned to give 125 families to conv@@ ey the plant@@ ation of fungi , as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached 100 % of its expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations from Can@@ do until Monday , 04 . September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ age , locally manufactured fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started with the &quot; production from the regions of the fungus , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was accomplished they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have created a &quot; teaching farm for the region . &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ing in many suburbs in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that war@@ med up in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people died , and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fireworks erup@@ tions that spread to the northern and central regions of the country , and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in Portugal , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area from the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make you a better picture of the serious situation : there are no fire in 4 districts .
the whole Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - N@@ ata ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter users divided images :
that is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the events :
the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection had not been able to cur@@ b the extent of tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al explained by the Federation of the farmers of Portugal to the p@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages became evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
they didn &apos;t do that Sunday : there are dozens of open streets , surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy would happen again as in June , because the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits will be question@@ ed in locations with a high industry risk .
an extensive proposal for a turning @-@ form , which brought the government according to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was approved by the Commun@@ es , which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ing of the law , which case the activity of the case was permitted , if the applic@@ ant could have a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; leads João Sor@@ val to p@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o on the same article .
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of slightly flamm@@ able wood , like in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of this kind always spread out .
on these problems , the site of the Civil Protection of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , as a resident of information , sought to contact people who was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information provided the people used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real @-@ time on the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched by the developers João P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire brig@@ ade in 2015 , so that the servers pursued the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users , which pursued the fires , didn &apos;t stand the site more than half a million .

in a night in autumn 1994 , the Taliban started Afghanistan through the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghan State for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the dawn the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick it up and bring him to the locks .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by the Taliban were murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt gri@@ eved .
the Taliban were getting closer to their hat@@ red at the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara fors@@ ook the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his small wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed s@@ acks with mort@@ ar , the heavier than he himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was affected by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open window , so we did not indul@@ ge at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af created his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food in need .
it is true that Italy , due to relatively high conditions , is a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are in the country is dis@@ astro@@ us .
the Human Rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special entrance centers , &quot; they are impro@@ vised in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre , if they officially have an application for asylum , which can still be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , need either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his indisp@@ utable life helped to free A@@ shar@@ af soon from these conditions .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af spent his total savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while and opened a small limb@@ us .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afghan people live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghan companies , including cutting equipment , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari in Padua opened the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na Pizzeria in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are far beyond the Italian food industry and retail , and aim to return to the country that he had to leave for a teen@@ ager .
&quot; wherever a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country , and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same options as all the others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also ador@@ ns plans for opening a factory in Kabul where people can learn packaging and con@@ serv@@ icing techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest cor@@ ds on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the successful entrepren@@ eur was a trip through un@@ certainty and doubt , but at the end is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help others to help others in this path .
Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : legislation from Egypt offer dis@@ continued social networks Mah@@ moud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the clearing of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , protest@@ ing against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot , which shows challenges , victories and upcoming trends in the world &apos;s Internet
the Egyptian Parliament enters a draft bill , which pre@@ views that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a governmental department .
users would have to use the social networks to be able to use social networks , within six months of successful law casting on the website of the authority using its complete name as well as their identity number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to a penalty of up to six months or the end of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by six@@ ty members of Parliament , is currently under legislative and the constitutional committee of Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
in May , a legislative proposal submitted a proposal to be introduced to the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or high officials .
under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of the President and state facilities are already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , such act would be pun@@ ish@@ able with prison and fin@@ es , such as right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is adopted , this can mean by three years in prison for the convicted .
in addition , this would be a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud plan Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , when he was captured by the Egyptian police officers , demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators who led against the military coup led to the president of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan looked like more than 700 participants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison on a court date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th May , because of human rights groups , the def@@ endants will fail to bring the def@@ endants from prison in the court@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ lights of inter alia weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and an attempt murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary freely . they were charged for their coverage to the pro @-@ mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya in Cairo .
the court also reduced the sentence of journalists Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested for the previously mentioned incident , 25 years ago .
Tunis@@ ian activists listen to scanned documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities have six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily heard on a negoti@@ ated action plan . Bes@@ ag@@ ter plan was supported by the President of the Republic , which would explicitly provide a controversial draft by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption .
the document issued on the 21st of April on the page of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light on how the prepar@@ atory plans look like to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Code , which journalists ensure the right to protection of their sources .
however , he entered the District Court in Tunis , on May 09 , as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media , to present their identity ?
according to the new rules of the National Council of the People &apos;s Office of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share news in social media .
in the regulations it is stated that the registration with full re@@ els will be required .
analysts susp@@ ect that this should be achieved by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in social networks . it is un@@ clear until now , how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese supplies have proposed in social media , to impos@@ e these rules only sel@@ ective to protect the journ@@ alism and independence .
then see we in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat settled to register as the organis@@ er of the information distribution . &quot;
this name is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that the government does not allow the government to act responsi@@ bly for removing content and force them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ by@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court owns Sper@@ m Wikipedi@@ as
a Turkish court dispos@@ ed of the lock Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to delete two English speaking articles , the indications that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication has been imprisoned , because they collabor@@ ated on &quot; a source of information related to groups to attack a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop , her@@ d@@ ling
following this week , the UK government is located in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with increased surveillance , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and to encryp@@ t the data encryption .
the government has cons@@ ulted the telecommun@@ ications company and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civil population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 . may . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
