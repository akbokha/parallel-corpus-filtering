<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA for at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have been danced to American music, read American writers and operated his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I was 14 years old, I saw the grand Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered murderous conspiracy of an oil Magnati, who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I think it was as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">I said, "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose variety is so inviting, that you can always be that you are and it's easy to find in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about tourism and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, as it goes with its narrowness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops with his mind behind the mountain, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the people responded to his statements and tuned them in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million voices, which he won at republican elections, was the highest number one ever achieved by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigots person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to bring Trump and his voter with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the Journalists Program, taking up people from around the world, a deep believing person that I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trump Weltanschauung not agreed with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours of watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who struggled for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family that treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with patience and grace, and helped me to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentor, had helped me a lot at my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied through them are deepened my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump his way to the appointed republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, said the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people have voted for trump, because they were either on racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as a breed.</seg>
<seg id="34">To subordinate people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and indicates inability to understand who are acting and thinking in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears are not considered about hectic changes in their congregations.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they would say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who discusses the cruel decision to rise a man who looks like contempt on those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Fig.).: as much as "based on white against all other Ethnia"; word game from white into play on the White and whiplash (as much as Schleukin-trauma), as it was the great Van Jones, has exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people around the world estimate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you always like, America is welcome every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as his President, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America's promise of this promise and says, Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole notion of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man is once again on the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices got louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with his words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that isn't your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From misery to the stars: these Latin American children can't spoil their love for music by waste</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, while a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Church in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaic town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places is not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca, and # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from nearby excellent lumbar and its world famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years, the La Banda de MÃºsica (music bande) has been playing in the community: one out of children and adults of existing symphony orchestra consisting of their musical instruments to overcome the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot that started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, meaning local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you meet day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically on the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay, on instruments which are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments, which consist of local waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycler started under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez to turn parts of waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments can imitate violins, viola, celli, double bass, guitar, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers the beginning of the time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place the children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not cooperate with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made of waste was made.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra which plays out on instruments made of resurrected material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about a billion tonnes of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the brightest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring drama from trash to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music by Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication happens during an agreement with Global Voices, for shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was then known that this ship was already in illegal waters of illegal fishing, before it looked up the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were thus raised and inclined to welcome a bill in its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">In Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comres, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised himself against the ship. they refused to carry him to their harbours and refused to judge him a fishing ban.</seg>

<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the region's waters: it was not succeeded to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was forced to pay 2 million dollars in Liberia, due to pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which explores criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO Stop illegally fishing (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network were distributed by six countries that had expelled the Premier of their waters.</seg>

<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition, what is caught is hidden, absent because it is extremely difficult to locate it. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws, which should be protected by certain habitats and species, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing was once hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, the actions happen today in real-time, with traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange or read listings, news about suspect activities or details that you notice or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very alert when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas - such as suspects to discover that a ship invites his caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies show if the ships have a fishing license where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fishing are allowed on the basis of this information that the ships cannot be sold in their harbours. and that they could not sell their cargo to numbers, as in the case of Prime Minister.</seg>

<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Executive Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales, which lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to the illegal fisher that penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive fish fisheries that attracts the region's commercial fishing trade around the world. among these even those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other things include promotions, such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, specifying fantasia names, fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>

<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legal torch tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several deceitful identities and it has fled and found winged ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with Interpol, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across major distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i to sustain suspicious ships.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, also helps to track the illegal ships to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we are trying to pass through, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat tracking, a NRO who also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can't be used by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects various information of information. FISH-i should help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But if FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the inevitable global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform in cooperation with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and is able to display the position of every traceable ship worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="141">We should do this on global level. "" Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run with which a global system permits the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which previously exploited without license and hardly to reckon with consequences, now know they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries involved in FISH-i already have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats or more licenses.</seg>

<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quixano was Gendarmeriewer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was from 1976 to 1978. he was Deputy Chief of Intelligence 141 in the Prison La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quixano, the oppressors who was charged with abduction in 158 cases, torture, killing in nearly 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the magnitude of atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and he spoke before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent on his child, and as this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a dickhead, you are friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Just don't worry, that they will not escape you one day and then I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The acronym stands for EjÃ©rcito Turucionario del Pueblo, the Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my Father had raised me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university clasps, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">Because over there the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me to La Perla four times - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack, in the car, furniture, TV, refrigerators - simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small wrapped parcel and told me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects have been removed and stopped me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he fell on an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Over there the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a bunkbed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they stood at the end of a cable hanging. the other end was attached to the person's body which was tichained.</seg>
<seg id="241">They captivate a man with handcuffs on the bed, shot him with water and sent him a charge of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The strife there was terrible... like a dirty winch.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same odor came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much harm another?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra, the area where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and were treated to eye.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilian that was also charged in the process) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a series of mattresses on which naked man lay with the face down - all were captivated by hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance, people tranquil to the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners, he said, "What guckest thou, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I met "Why did you get me?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and were buried by soldiers and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that, because my father told me home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were known as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know, "Palito," Romero beat a man there and killed him.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to information by survivors, Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in La Perla-Ribera, was also accused of death of the students RaÃºl Mateo Molina.</seg>

<seg id="262">The path that you came in here is also the way on which they came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">If you look at the map, see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were given a number assigned to the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement of the above came, that they should be moved.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'Warriors'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things with home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea what the "warriors" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was by the military even later, I was in the Gendarmerie - became clear to me that war criminals are a bayonet or perhaps military signs which one takes to an enemy who has fought for it.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if one walks into a house and put the refrigerator, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... then it is not a war, but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I have always wondered how my father, the head of security forces, could join this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it just.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the Gendarmerie and I would never have liked to get into a house and to steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my Father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">He called me a criminals and I answered: and you that you ascend to the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not criminals?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded over anger, and struck me, and cried, saying,</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then will I find you and take you alone.</seg>
<seg id="283">We need no one another!</seg>
<seg id="284">This was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no one good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo of then on which I wore a jacket and a turtrough pullover. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes at home.</seg>
<seg id="288">Back then, the defence accused me of being a pity on this crime. I said no problem, they can lay hold on me what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">'The disappearance of the body is the last abominous act '</seg>
<seg id="291">Now where I am older, I feel repentance.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. once you have children, one sees the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops and recognizes that it's wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">So good, you were exectively speaking during the dictatorship. but why the corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why do children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day, my father brought a girl with his mother, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always imagined the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">You could have just put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families who were handed over to their mortals?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominous act, which one can do a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they fetched machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were crushed and found somewhere - no idea where. "you will never find something," said my father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains forever.</seg>
<seg id="307">'I have seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to clear it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just have said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea of view my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him audition for all of the atrocities that I had to experience himself because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said, "I don't know. I have not killed anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt inviolated and asked me why all the exagated patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings" that they allegedly defended, actually was good.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed horrible crimes and compelled me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">He only said "Well, then show me."</seg>
<seg id="320">I just did that.</seg>
<seg id="321">I reimbursed the first ad in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminals.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can imagine that I am prejudiced. I eventually quit my own father.</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with translation errors at a centre in Kyoto, where one can extend his driving licence.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was spread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Review of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center where one can extend his driving licence, in the last month witnesses of a very abused translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word, the "older drivers" means, "the older drivers" means, but perhaps also with armournly backgrounds & # 8212; as "terrible drivers" translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be printed on electronic ads from 1 to 20 September at the entrance hall and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was often shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyoto. he was also aware of the local time.</seg>
<seg id="352">The newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable. "said Sherlock Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The flawed English translation was first removed. later, the term "" "" "(German:" terrible drivers ") was later replaced by the appropriate term" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation errors. furthermore she explained that the mistake had been found in the text that they had received from the translators, and that the translation was not tested on their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sorry that older people felt insulted through the inadequate correction (the translation) for our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News set out a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "fearful" has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents, are very important to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto, for example, 1,941 from a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this represents a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1,803 caused a total of 11.850 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="364">This means that their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of seniors caused incidents in the same period has risen.</seg>
<seg id="366">The naming non-mentioned reporter has published comments on the light published on Yahoo, which show the prejudices some Japanese seemingly against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo about the translation errors received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" terrible drivers ") about reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">- "Thus does the translation actually not work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think that is a real translation mistake."</seg>
<seg id="371">There are no few such comments.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two key skills: passive language skills to understand the text text and an active language skills to broadcast him in the destination language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter demands the active domination of the target language - something that is in the case in native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native language should translate into French as an example - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language, which could translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for translation, cost reasons or the relatively small number of english speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, leave translations even firing internally. then the Japanese employees, whose English knowledge will be the best, for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The promising and enigmatic sentences created by machine translation will show that this technique can still not replace a human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the smoothold prints, often used T-Shirts or bags, are used only from stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or acceptable as a jewelry, or at least harmless. but of large companies or by the government to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a reputable source for their translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censors take on internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the Portals "Navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet use that they didn't have access to online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the use of VPITV and El Capitolio TV will also be no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Also other online radio stations carried pictures of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositioning groups who oppose the government NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and had transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was tied, and recommended the Usage, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censr: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites of Venezuelan Provider are again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezolanern with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant since 2014 on the reporting of protests. at that time, the Commission threatened to report on telecoms with cash punishments and lockings if they continue to report about the demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a "Call to Violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEs later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was unaccessible through a lock of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies the website to broadcast the meetings of the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research institutes of the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet provider may use DNS to use, through which the DNS servers respond to certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server answers or refuses the request when calling a such website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">When VPITV, a third-locked channel, the broadcast was set on Thursday 6th April, when the VPITV camera was Elvis Flores, who was transferred to Caracas live in prison.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later, he was released, and VPITV was returned to broadcast again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government is also reported that the government regulates the Internet connections: thus, the Venezolanians will always keep the access to multi-media coverage over current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household, where she did not live together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before she graduated from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about them. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">Those who have become something of something, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga has never been treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, one denotes the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a big family with little money outlines its miners-old son or her miners-old daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child will receive food, education and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned, however, that the children have to pay for a few days of housework that can never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all that can not be lifted up.</seg>
<seg id="425">As Criadazgo practice this practice is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduation, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected things to say, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">They tried to call things by name, as the feeling of gratitude is vaccinated for criaditas, guaranteed to be silent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the criadazgo is based on a double deception," Alvarenga explains.</seg>

<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon that takes place in the secret in paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n was in CaaguazÃº in the hospital, her body showed traces of severe blows. soon she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military staff TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer at the residence register.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">Ferreira plunged until the end of January 2016 with a stick to MarÃ­n until they suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of a young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They begged that the murder child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were the deeply involved in the practice of the girl Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered together to protest groups and demanded that there would be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, among which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations demanded a speedy study of the Falls.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criaditas become exploited only as labour power, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik worked in which her father worked, bankrupt and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work, and began to sell, on the street, or on the sweets, to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent as Criadita in the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in the house of their employers between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">At the same time, she had to share the time that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays for example, they purified the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished furniture and desinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because they had to have dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the refrigerator," she reminds.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings the budgetr alvarenga, next to him and Editorial from Oppositioniences such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo" to read.</seg>

<seg id="473">They feared your Lord that she had enabled the formation which she had enabled to lose again, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But you were totally clear that they had paid for everything they had paid for them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Alvarenga was discriminated in the school, too. "a thing about which almost never spoken are bullying and the chicans where criaditas are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, where friendships arise, I felt particularly well that I didn't belong to any group.</seg>

<seg id="499">Draft bill to pre-register Egyptian users social media, to register with the government</seg>
<seg id="500">Image by Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary groups recently ordered a bill to "regulate regulation on use and commercial social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When it is adopted by Parliament, users and users must register social media in Egypt under a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, then a position would be established in order to provide a permit for social media citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the acceptance of the law, users would have to register users on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers, to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it failed to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months' imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The draft, which consists of six articles and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application that is going through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video tutorials and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary committees and supporters of the bill, told the magazine Al-monitor, registered user accounts and users received a username and password to get through the firewall, the Facebook block. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to judge a firewall at the national level around Facebook. because of them it would be necessary to submit information about their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "senior research specialist") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), said Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I have a strong impact on the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt for things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they have violent physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means that they will arrange a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people, and also to bring it to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">To be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed under the Legislative of Parliament and the Constitutional Complaints before going into the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military mind in the parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviation will be present on the image area," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill to vote against Cyber Crime, in which a life imprisonment sentence was planned for those who claim to rebuke "public order" and "protest to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq, the animal protective Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the Nichtregation organization Nature Iraq work to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the bigger family of leopards, which are aged by Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). they are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are found because of Wilderei, loss and fragmentation of their habitat, because they are always less loot at risk.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">How Raza shows in the video, "is the Persian leopard the only remaining noise in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the thought of the ecosystem is also dependent on that a large prey is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards actually can be seen in the free game of wild. hence, when the team appears in the video that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza likes to show another side of their country, which consists not only from war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies with wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to promoting protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the progress made in the north-east of Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, which was progressing in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who had been hit by the "threefold disaster," a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahou Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a kind of prefectures in Japan's Northeast, who had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring countries of Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had disappeared whole coastal cities.</seg>
<seg id="547">The prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows a local view that has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local population.</seg>
<seg id="549">The newspaper's detailed report includes both statistics of the Japanese reorganization as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahou Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare homes (foreseman, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi, the biggest success of the three prefectures were recorded, where 80 percent of the planned replacement stores were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas in the Fukushima happened 70 percent of its final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the disaster, he evacuated also six years after the disaster, evacuated by Behnfschateau (foreseers, Kazaksu juutaku) to the final replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in domestanding.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still lived in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi had been successful in emergency shelters, whereas more than 75 per cent of the evacuated products, which have been settled after the disaster in the shelter.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>

<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of harbours in Iwates and Miyagi are now back in operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of fisheries harbors have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and the nuclear accident, have severely affected in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only one episode of the nuclear accident, because only 690-hectare of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima, are located in the "nuccal locking zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely again, but Fukushima still remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">Tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima only has 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population being prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total picture, the newspaper resulted in numerous questionings among the local population and under the evacuated accounts. she questioned them about the state of rebuilding and also how to find themselves compared to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahou Shimpo led a survey to get more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local resident population has taken measures to be prepared for future quakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, there are 55.9 percent of respondents that still haven't been done in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture,</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahou Shimpo newspaper has increased its attention to the location of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness to the worst, disastrophic accident that had ever had to experience Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were transferred outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">In early 2016 a little more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled in permanent replacement stores.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 state, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still living in Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuated regions are older than 50 years old. they have to be found in proper domination because they have to compete in the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is a part of construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people encounter people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that a more one more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important since they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we treat topics that can get less attention in reporting as they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices, who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to anyone about language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer struck him while a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia with a rammer on the head. nationwide, millions of protesters participated in protesters against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, the social sciences at the University of GoiÃ¡s studied, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread quickly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The face of police officers can also recognize the face of the police officer, who attacked with a demolition. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian federal state GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he proposes in GoiÃ¢nia with his rammer on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officers were beaten by a demonstrators and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would therefore be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a press channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video in the net, where you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary shortly after it hurts.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video filmed with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">The clip shown below shows the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another federal state, we have donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (approximately 2,700 Euro) to cover a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in GoiÃ¢nia while he is in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further acts of violence against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s is experienced a wave of political force: here the activist Guilherme was killed Irish from his father, and here we have been a occupied school with a gas leck, and here we have been attacked by a police station, after being attacked by a police officer, who has put him on his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police attacks</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil, where it came to a brutal police force on Friday in the past Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen put on protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where protesters had set up a stage for Redner, Rubmigrade and TrÃ¤nengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to abandon violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media traps have been fortucked by focusing on another, unexpected protagonists: a window plate.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a distal glass window to shape their cover pages with photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo preferred the cover story with a bus-set bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more on a broken window disk than the protests of replacement people who serve the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also acknowledge, if one is strictly against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, the term "Vandalism" is a absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violence of the military police are expelled with the title "protesters" on confrontation with the police. "</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central and Spanish sugar mill, regardless of that there is no significant sugar harvest.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the circumstance the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost and after its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others are signed and commuting every day to the factories, grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solubheteran which rises every day at 4: 00 AM, the crisis in the sugar cane and does not have his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane factories, which are again in operation after a long inactive time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers themselves to have heard that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry implies the plagues, the case of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for a few decades ago, but the bad harvests have already been no news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economical necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories, which amounted to 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only have the factories left to produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane and the sugar rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">The sugar level rose again in front of a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO report, agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will come into history with certainty," these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the construction of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene as he is known as a soldier, talking about the closure of the factory is the word that he is most repeated, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">The first letters began, the first letters began.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was official surveyed documents which only differ regarding the parts that would be removed, the address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultimo Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was surpassed and the letters were increasingly common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the discounted factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still running sugar refinery."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the laying of the factory, whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important job producer has been obliterated.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for the workplaces and services provided in the communities were created, in which they found themselves.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut speech of 21 October 2002, the former president in the eyes of the present persons saw, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the Congregation Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich learnt that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to abrupt them, they also listened to asphaling the road, this disadvantage also other establishments.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced old age, Nene and Eddy had to open other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were shared to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area a food factory was created, whose production does not even serve for the provision of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are also imposing.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Youngsters of the First Nations-Communities in all Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they are doing hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, since 2014 workshop manager mobile sound studios bring directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were headed by David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten cree-communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing the young participation in conversations related topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-adoption," or whatever of them coming to sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspired by songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," at which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a videospiels to convey as important to the receipt of traditional customs and customs, despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people have not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagooki Cree First Nation is recorded, the refrain will be sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The boys involved got some help from Gary Jolly by the Northstars Hip Hop Group who gives them a Strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the stanza is at your disposal as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like that no one would ever be interested in myself</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I do not want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also lead to our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus, they can do what is intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In comment, the reader and author of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds to the stanza of Silesia (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, will be found near the entrance shokuhin sandy puru (burgers, "plastic models of dishes") from each dish that will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes, and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district, there are a multitude of these small businesses that make up those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so unusual that they didn't even call them anymore. however, a new trend converts them today into a showy mobile accessory and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matomes, the blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sandy puru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic dishes decorated mobile phones, such as they will be shown in Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned to kitschy collecting objects such as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin refrigerants for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in Essences is becoming increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile-stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this three-dish bowl (lol), we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple containing your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the coma.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designer allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon have been used, a popular troopping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there somebody who would say: "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handles made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further skurrile plastic dishes you can view at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # rubriers "man."</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district Kappabashi, which is devoted to the restaurant industry's popularity.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico the missing and killed billets are regularly appearing on statistics. these mirrors, however, are not reflected at all the extent of the human tragedy that brings to this battle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of Sinaloa, thronts the stories of the victims of the conflict absolutely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, barely anyone looking at the mourn or the churches which have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every body, behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds will never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "dealing with drug trafficking live") in order to give this victims a voice and stories of people told the struggle between prosecution and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime cannot be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug traffickers, and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "like fear life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who is looking for secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father and sisters at just one day, lost her four sisters, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "like every Sunday, we also prepare ourselves to the task that we have placed us, go and go to graves, for the people we have loved to seek."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28, when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he was supposed to be back again, but he never returned. "Emma Veleta:" it is very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, which is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are subject to the insurance of my father, but they don't get paid out because they demand a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>

<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a book by Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central and Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form them occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensitivity journalism now for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass each day to newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is pounded or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be indifferent or considered to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to be Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people listen to the "heroic" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is that, as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear, that also something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories are to block numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to speak that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months Erpressing in the Capital District: like a family with threats raided." in this, she describes how armed criminals destroyed money from their business until they did not only destroy the business, but also their family were torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you've lost and about how some people can change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain above never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The other we are apart, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they kill or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I wondered in these terrible days, if weeping would dissolve my deep root feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the post "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he asks questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, their parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes cooked, tortillas warm and "chichi" for the babies who are living with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, she told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years ago when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody grave of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a result of the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the civil council for public safety and the government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutors amounted to 3103 murders. this equates to average 8.5 hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few hundred thousand stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and invade them into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico is launched in 2015, whose objective is to represent the complex information behind the failed battle against drug trafficking who has tortured the country in the last four decades, in an understandable manner.</seg>
<seg id="816">If a picture is worth a thousand words</seg>
<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas WikstrÃ¶m (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNUNG: this post and the pages to which he is linked, contain pictures on which violence is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment in which it concerns to lift up a rumour or falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something that emerged in the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, it tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it was used deceptive, supporting tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false script of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denies not denies that there are abundant coverage of events in DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the place Sange in the East of the DR Congo, kippte and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, the country's second largest country had been neglected for years, and thus devastated. the streets in the region became too dangerous paths, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to the victims.</seg>
<seg id="828">The government officials are described by a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a cinemas in the vicinity, full of people watching the soccer world championships.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses were scattered and scattered corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of that day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Top is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of hollow body, which are floated on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was fished several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but not to be attributed to the tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote areas of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities, before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the figures could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count bodies," said a resident of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were mutilated, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture of the DR Congo disappeared again, as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has been documentaries to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the image has been presented as proof of mass agencies.</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step further bring personal comments like this example illustrates the picture of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The painting from Sange occurred also in conjunction with the lethal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash raid, published by the United Nations, those who could flee were strokes, rape and some dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following arose, which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR of Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image comes from an Saudi-Arab news page, which claimed to be falsely, the president Myanmars Than being said, monks and politicians have been involved in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition she had used the picture from DR Congo to interpret this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was picked up on 26 April 2017, can be viewed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations, which called AFP as their source, had likewise asked Than being this statement, but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo in connection.</seg>
<seg id="859">The world wide range of false statements</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false links vary up to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">By using a "inverted picture search" you can see how far information can be crossed.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted picture search with the TinEye search engine has 18.8 billion pictures (as of 3 May 2017) 344 images, which are very similar to the picture from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed masch private pages, platforms social media and communities as well as national publications and are in many different languages like English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have redirected false reports, others have attempted to unmask counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have bound examples of abusive use and linked them to the respective countries, based on what page they had been published. thus, we want to display the range more clearly than by the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">Several examples of abusive use can be used from the listed countries below (which in some cases) can be used for misuse.</seg>
<seg id="867">Here are some cases that can now be completely upset (on the map in orange):</seg>
<seg id="868">Map: News frames.</seg>
<seg id="869">State-examples of the wrong couplings of the DR of Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="870">Based on pages or servers, the orange-based countries are still available on the examples of counterfeits or faltering.</seg>
<seg id="871">The countries in grey are examples that are available according to the metadata and information that are available via TinEye, probably also counterfeit examples.</seg>
<seg id="872">As a reminder, the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo (in blue).</seg>
<seg id="873">Algeria, 2012. "what happens in Burma-Myanmar?" a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum (established in Algerian and interested Arabs) as part of a thread to the "war of Buddhists against Muslims."</seg>

<seg id="880">Canada, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="881">In this post, a blogger from Quebec City did not only discuss the abuse, but also discuss the abuse of the picture from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions on the Intanions of Persons and the tragedies (in DR Congo and beyond).</seg>

<seg id="884">La RepÃºblica is quoted as his source the Spanish news agency EFE (which is not known whether the original report contains the picture).</seg>
<seg id="885">France, 2015.</seg>

<seg id="918">The picture was weathered for the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved), but the messages that were associated with it were raised in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that pull these posters. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the murders of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second frame uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion is to be understood and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth considering how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens when readers do no longer give faith to those images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are less people who are unintended to exercise the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Implies this mood of false and false information that the actual atrocities are untrue and will decorate the real atrocities of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of nonviolent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the return of images of a refusal is equal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern that violent pictures, readers and spectators deselect and receive the ability to receive empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media act on it to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While in discussing some nonviolent representations in the news media, fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you will have to think thoroughly about the situation where a picture is somewhat suggests, in which a picture can be resolved by the context or at completely abusive species.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (e. g. unreadable) tries to offer language enthusiastic about words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words are in any language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt to a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression does not suffice, why a full explanation and sometimes a context required to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, for example words from the VAT-lap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemba yourself in recognition of your parents in acknowledging how it strives for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsric language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or sloth that you feel after being heated in the sun in cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They disgrind other cultures, enthuse other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish more of this "unreadable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive are these small languages.</seg>

<seg id="1001">My girlfriend looks at me and says, "These things concern not you, or?" "why, because I am not Muslims?" I ask.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already led this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years, separate me - the Sahar who know them - from the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They escapes me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practise our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, in different kind of art. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims, like I don't fit there, will be muscular.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Dismissions to be mixed</seg>
<seg id="1011">I will not stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This even happened to the poet, whose poetry is most widely sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">As a Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox of Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran, and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western imagination, religion was deleted Rumis, as well as the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists of the reduced images of Muslims, which Western books have been colonial for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This enticing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The one-white American scientist Edward Said distressed the history behind these pictures in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But today these pictures continue to rise today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">They continue our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="1025">For thirteen years I worked in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful, incorrect Narrative is dominating our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narratively overshadows the reality that have led to their countries in the last three decades, while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This fool fails to recognize that if French, Muslim women are prevented from confined their headscarf to public buildings and are forced to cover their entire body through their government to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group does his "control" to the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong Narrarian weakens Muslim women who lead movements to change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It implies that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to an American floor of Africans, which were brought along with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This scar is deeply and flawed by our collective imagination, that often Sikh men and children are used to aim antifungal attacks and chicology.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and about the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion dollars</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narratives, which help us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry, too, has failed to record the scar of 1,7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we have failed here, where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree "diverse" religious groups in America.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for storyart wants to preserve urbane languages</seg>
<seg id="1135">History tell, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity, here and now, despite a language barrier to contact someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is possible.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about Steven Bird's other initiative, the incible blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or in Oakland, in the United States, where TLS had already conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project are:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world's languages may be avoided when we do cities, the diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to enter.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening often is often linked to understand," listening these events instead "listening to feel right to establish."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytelling stories will initially tell their story in their own language and translates or declare it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are no professional story tellers, their devotion and their portrayal is that the listeners are allowed to incorporate.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the story narrator Rassidatou will also take the opportunity to explain the story of the narrative element of the narrative element.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the cable of the bunny and the Pavian in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">Having explained the meaning of his misabel, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grinct he shares his feeling of inclusion:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities took place, and the organisers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the USA Neuenforcement of the State School</seg>
<seg id="1155">On 3 April 2017, with the aim of a new check out of the public debt of Puerto Rico, several religious and bourgeois organizations involved in a mass demonstration; the march started at the pubic Capitol, the capital building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the Old City of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda." (civil war for the neurotting of debts) and the Ãkomenical Church meeting in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of new debts have also submitted a petition on official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people Puerto Rican demands that politicians, banks and government agencies that are responsible for debts to be held responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for financial examination and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not their.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not find out with decreasing pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not integrated in the United States - is suffering from a heavy financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Thus, the so-called "Centre for New Economy" is an independent non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on socio economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to existing state view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and conviction of citizens danger, to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration was named "Nightwatch for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as the Bassel Safadi, is missing since more than one year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives put the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, dedicated itself to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, publisher of Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, blown out excerpts from the book cost of Freedom: a Collective Invole (The Cost of Freedom: a collective replica).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was released last year and is licensed here, contains a set of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are being built, and what the real costs are linked to those of them.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have page worked to look over the nebulae that surrounds our newsfeeds in order to make sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the Adra prison directory, in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us begin to think about their own fates, deeds, and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given to this process of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and Digital Activist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police base was based on a" strictly geheim "command of the military court taken out of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who introduced himself as the insider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death part against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of creative Commons reactive in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in expanding its access to the internet and to know knowledge about the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and momentary head of the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the kind of cultural prototypes were predictive as the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and here merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put all this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysrien, but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stripper set into digital archeology and the preservation has created a period of time created for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Basically, Bassel could not close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and wrote about the passion of her husband, to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overcome when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners, as they use computers, at least theoretically without knowing they actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel und Noura was working together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She flipped the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1227">Here an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens during each visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">I sing in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind at the moment, in which we embrace you,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers is no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and keepers</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the thrill of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I penetrate every detail of your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I carry with passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes say farewell</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To bring back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to cry and smile upon your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I persuaded myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the arrest of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year passes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During this season, during</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you're still in the cage of the monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">Nature's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the protests in 2011 protests against the regime Bashar al-Assads, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (syrational Network for Human Rights) disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime, were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: after the release of corruption, Mozambique was reacting again to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Muslims reacted to anger with anger, in which a government member, after half his sentence, returned to the workplace of the state machine in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other accused due to impleverance of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza in between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately requested his return to the company, which took place on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which claims the motion for Cambaza, there would be no obstacle course for Cambaza, as the company performed no disciplinary procedure after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many habitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to address the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Provides a backlash in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a setback in terms of the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of, is that the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the states of jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently doesn't seem to have appropriate legal steps for the use of the corresponding features.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior as well and considered the case as "decentral":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza had been an expert type, he would have been a consultant after he was sentenced to one prison sentence, and half of them have drowned.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could suspect speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to become reintegrated into the company which he helped inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradict!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the stock of any morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza of the state rewarded, because he insulted him I can not believe that someone is rewarded by someone who has so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the moral and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only serves himself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handing it was a tiring source of money and the state itself has become faint, the pre-loaded and finally condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief belongs to prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel not only to remain the first independent president of the Mozambique, but also as a sharp, engaging and - by the other - prophetic redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous mappings was, when he was energetic, that "an ambitious human being capable of, also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is also criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he was 10 years old and released.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today, the company relies on the contract with which he replicates money, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - The Î±etric International (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo from the journal @ Verdade (to dt.: @ truth) states that crime in Mozambique pays:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook is blocking the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burial word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or age.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network received its post from the net because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian source or generally considered an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">The word "Kalar" or "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascent of radical nationalistic movements has given an extremely abortive connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists as an Hassspeak against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight Hassay in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'is usually related to racism, but the word itself does not call forth Hassay.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about the expression of his usage, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same sequence of letters as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written to Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (age-age), 'Kalar Oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookutzer Aung Myat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual way, if he could know how he could alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set hau - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that she is going to reduce Hasslanguage's radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook will be more analytical to spread Facebook before all postits, that would spread to racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook delete the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, analyzing the post carefully and check it by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age-age).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these dirty nationalists, spread the Hassay, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">It is now time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who like Hassay, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords often have a catch- and mouse game, where users can easily start social networks to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the written word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to clear his post when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from content, post and parts of Content for 24 hours, because the post "Facebook community did not escape."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their views against the Hasstalk of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hysteria:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasstalk about Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more requests before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a beneficial intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words will be used only once more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they start this without a local context or technical support, and so words like "chair" or "peas curry" have forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to berate the feitful posting.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they complained about a large turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Datasheets automatic censorship has taken care of the user for a lot of fun.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking serious concerns, users now make fun and write the word "Kalar" in the context of Hasslanguage to see if its post is taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook postings, which contained no Hassay, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and see peas and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook has the mail containing the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's date is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, Parliament of the country unanimously decided to ban a law that is supposed to ban these practices, so that the heatitude age is 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this amendment of the Ehegesetzes, there was a large public outcry in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups in the country assembled, that the state should not interfere with the state that the state does not interfere with the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting partner of the UN Children's Convention, the minors as, "defined every man under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of the children who were already married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and at 18 there were 8,1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19 boys in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which were endeavoured to abolish laws for children's before, followed up at the foot and rejoiced with great support. without doubt, they helped me to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">However, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to tell the critics of the children's before they should take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition provided for tensions in this actually uncomplicated cause, and eventually came in doubt whether the Opposition would agree to the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill was decided against the children's face - despite the 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained in the House of Representatives, where an easy majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which reposted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against children's face was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes against it and not only one single against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he has previously decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users had been enthusiastically because the laws for the infancy had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member, Lovell Francis, who was involved in the Ministry of Education at the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has used too much time and unnecessary talk, which sparks the heart of the thing, but do you know what? the children's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was in the opinion it was definitely long enough to stop the practice, Lara Quentall-Thomas was happy that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status update on Facebook of Lara Quentall- Thomas, which says: News, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Ehegesetz has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who listens to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society which was quite openly about it, as important the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The heatitude of Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years regardless of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The design for the change of marriage was approved today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 deputies and 35 of them were present at the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All deputies who were against, have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's stay in Trinidad and Tobago are not allowed by law.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...) # childmarriagedildo.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have expressed it.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thanks to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook is in the form of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, said it was absolutely legitimate when Maharaj would proceed against the law, most of the social media users would have regard the debate differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Vorrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking, in a way we can only talk about the problem that the state will protect the state in our bedrooms, that it may be used by big, hard-driven men that will be abused to them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children's before in different gradations are legal or still the norm, although there are laws which they sign.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers checks the office of the prosecutor in front of national festivals on Russian national holiday</seg>
<seg id="1383">Screen print of the message posted early on Sunday early on the website of the Yaroslavl district.</seg>
<seg id="1384">On the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption, which coincides with the day of Russia - the Russian national holiday, the hackers have left a funny message "stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Or we will take you from Dimon instead of Dimon. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">Hackers posted the YouTube video "He is not a diDimon for you" on the website of the State Secretary with the following comment: "the office of the prosecutor calls on the citizens to follow the provocation, and to keep away from all non-sanctioned events!"</seg>
<seg id="1387">At 11.15 the message was removed from the site - but in the cache they remained.</seg>

<seg id="1389">On Sunday, the office of the National Intelligence Office shared the local news service YarNews that they were chopped up.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Through the mirrors of websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again.</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia page was presented to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA on 18 January 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month the Turkey has blocked the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle-based cyclopaedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is more obvious how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and writers and fans of TV-series fight against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques used are used to use enveloping tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been subject to Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been taking place since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most well-known country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrors pages (pages that reflect the contents from Wikipedia and frequently be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPletary File System) when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages at its decentralised Peer-to-Peer-Network (so machine-machine connections) which is not supported on the domain name system, so that it does not make a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is callable, however, in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything on Wikipedia from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform so it is possible to read the contents on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if you cannot reach the www.wikipedia.org website.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror-source of Wikipedia, and also WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors pages if in the respective country of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open peaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">This is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You are accessing a different URL, which is not the original. that is what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself when it is blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he saw around himself, never satisfied. you were blurred with badly shaped motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivates him a camera to carry and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring to the international stage for Sagar, Nepals.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right beside the Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures, which direct attention to Nepalese wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook like this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate game photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when in Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was found and I immediately began making pictures kneeling!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar streaves a collaboration with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not so terrifying as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood by face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also, because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the King of the Buffer appeared. he puts up immediately, and we look at me and he stares through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">Its passion for the promotion of Nepalas nature and wild animals are not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent in order to make a tiger in Bardia National Park recordings of Otter. up to 12 days it lasted until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1465">Years after the wedding, there were Indian women for the first time to speak the name of their husbands</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India it will avoid women with greatest care, the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a ponomous or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should keep the norm in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state Onia and violated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition also does not call their wives by name, is also common among men. however, they have much less assignments to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly to the main jump theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, to discuss and discuss the fineness of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, who are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is involved in the exploitation of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's homes to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and heads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassador of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that showed Rohini in her discussion round, did not speak of women who mention their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of her husbands does not speak out loud, is a custom, which they all have been debited and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't keep this will be viewed as a listic, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband, has never been called by name for her, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the discussion of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband left for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned back to me and said, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in baggage, Rohini started her first discussion loss.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we cannot tell us the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that respect us not?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy, that while the whole exercise ran only in front of itself; another decided to turn the frustration that frustration to him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression of their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In addition to the adrenalin exchange with an ancient bra, the women decided that she would actually try to call her husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she stared, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of attendance was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the careless red point on the forehead that shows spouse status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the chin-red point, if he did it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely heard of it, but think that they are now in a better position to select himself, not to bear him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are doing a trip with every discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I do not want the women to make sure what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months she celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and spoke about things about which they never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and I have also about some things, for example like our identities attached to our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to tell certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is the okay, but some wanted to carry a Salman Kurta, a wide shirt above a pants, they have no dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own closeup, morals associated with the saris and much more, dinghed Rohini in a discussion round, so the women were able to carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion I have changed somewhat, Rohini confirmed that things are getting slowly into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have done so far only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tested it a few times, but then they listened to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now contributing to any time of Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in a discussion club know that changes they want to reach in their lives - like hash to move more freedom of movement or their own clothing - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But every club of us gives confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club is going home and other people talking about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from isolated groups in India and make videos about stories about which will not be reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">These stories are "news of those they themselves experience," and provide a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development demands.</seg>

<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan applies as a reversal in Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who was exclusively interviewed in London in 1964, noted during the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days, the Beatles were in the land, but this was enough to make the Japanese walk through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here is quite fast, that they didn't have any choice when the Beatles had received with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles had arrived in Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail trade Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! the today is the Beatles commemoration of Japan. the last two years ago they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Today, songs of the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in the Japanese language schools.</seg>

<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll John Lennon should be represented or not.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system for kidnapping of slightest people, probably for superstitious purposes, is worried by the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government had called a number of operations to stop the Praktik.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found and part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently acknowledged that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">It giving the local superstition that the head of a believing man could expose gold, explained the police precher of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that there were successive assaults to men in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of these people for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to a mission accomplished by the UN in the South African country in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government campaigns were developed to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of believing men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and killing of smooth individuals responsible for the profit and sale of their organs in the Morovbala province, for presumably superstitious rituals, has also taken into account the police of the Republic of Mozambique (PRM), which also exists that a faith exists, according to whom the victims would have power in mind, the riches of riches.</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: Netizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) Modern reaction of international community for medical treatment of Nobel laureates and dissident Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The fall of the Chinese dissidents of Liu Xiaobo had drawn attention to the international community after being admitted to the hospital in late June after his lawyer had been admitted to hospital in the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (State endangering), after he calls on the draft of the Charta 08, a manifesto which claims the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred Lius case as "an internal matter." he says it as "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to grant calls from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, poets in Liu Xia, to release or permit him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the Paares in Beijing, others were completely exhausted from the topic.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">Unified nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met Chinese civil servants at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">But a speaker, however, refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister in Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer any questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to the Stocks, after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government stated that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement in order to re-record the salmon progresses to China, since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee set his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">He was unable to receive his price because of his arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek emergency medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as her release in a statement on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We also anticipate that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Lius wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet all visits and receive who wish them, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told him that the Americans would wish to tell him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad, insofar as it was with his recovery. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary, Polley, gave the news agency AFP on the 27th of June to release the message of the Chinese authorities not only Liu, but also his wife Ms. Liu Xia free of her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The request of the US Embassy was a furious answer from China after changing the Ministry of Foreign Ministry that "no country have the right to interfere and inresponsible for Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley dealt with that China should offer the couple following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel health and access to medical care of its choice, which they have established according to Chinese constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditional.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I need China to unconditionally release the Nobel laureate # LiuXiaobo to go to a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany in Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">The German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin, that Liu "receives all the medical support he needed" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters, that China had major concerns, whether the vortex could be overshadow by Liu the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called to make Liu a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP first that Lius Mrs., Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in hospital and Liu was not allowed to contact someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to maintain its international human rights obligations including freedom of expression, to preserve these rights violations in the rights of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Office asked China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons on 29 June.</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments, regardless of where, is needed. furthermore, his wife and family can have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that you don't find any further information whether France will eventually commence.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan took on 27 June on 27 June to release Liu and a greater tolerance towards those who want to deploy peaceful resources to promote political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislators Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progress Party urged China to allow China to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very worried in a statement on 28 June by Liu very worried and gave many people to pray for Lius Wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith, that the initiatives that he took and had been punished for a more harmonious, more stable and wealthy China, which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly, as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was supposed to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting during a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, whereby most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "to reverse the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrificed to create this valuable country, one ceases to say that we are not in a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a escape from the responsibilities, a duty breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shanmuggestion were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in view of what he seemed unerratic to undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York City; equally cities which are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old lending of the authoritarian rulers take to be the foremost democrats, leaving the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the last week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests, our youth security, and our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He put appropriate questions with non-answers rational kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmuggesta to clear his mind as it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our value of K Shanmugam would take out the effort to clarify this point, if it was paid up to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By making Anon on the blog posted a comment, it shows on the reviews that you should begin to understand the entire script of the conference, so that you could understand the context of the testimonies of Shanmuggam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the address.</seg>

<seg id="1712">He compared to Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these towns saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore was not a country, obviously he did not understand it in this sense.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment of Shanmugat, as leader of a growing generation that makes such polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore told you very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old garde that awaits me - I agree with them or not, but that's a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not sure if he really believes that he really believes that he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review overlays the weak spots of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanmugam "have sinned a mistake, or was it a Freudor spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we are considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within government cabin, the sayings of Lord Shanmuggam are of severe significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singapura make their military service, but defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human resource?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">If the magazine Journey of a Decade to affirmation, Singapore was and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have a lot of Singapura more angry...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island country.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements like "the defense of the country, above all," etc, but that is not entirely correct.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1737">The Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked recently his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series, with the rumors revealed through certain parts of the world and a different facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry," I reply then. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his team of conversation by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clarification then follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook in front of anger if they are kept for Americans but does not bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For anyone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag well visible to her backpack when travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">It was so, when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before the invasion of Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th of September.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always wore small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There is no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriages are legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposedly considered the tolerant country toward ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends who I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't make me anything if you would like to confuse me with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp. "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, called "nice" means to be in essence - like the gutsive, soft, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">When Canada was really a nation of full people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem exists that "cute" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no edges and edges, nothing at which one can change.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless to be harmless, to be inconspicuous and ininteresting and no attention to earn.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good when you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far from things that happen around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, a prime minister of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own business.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outdoor standing can be called "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians aren't talking often about the fence across the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm hearted, open kindness that I connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice". our prime minister has made Canada heavily sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a Pop-Band parodized Thai Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">A music video published in Thailand has published a music video which took the Junta parodic, which took hold of power in 2014, and to restore civil government in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phails Girl) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what directs him his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, music video refers to the prolonged military domination of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, the video loaded on Facebook was given up to 1,254 times and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month the Charlie Chaplin video, "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists turned to the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics, notably as it is with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Watch the video of the video, which relate to some of the political issues, have followed in Thailand in the last three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44" rules of the girls "possibly refer to the drastic section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which are given to the Commander of the army, absolute decision making concerning important national themes.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change Your attitude" refers to the notorious programme of "subordination" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people considered by the Junta as critics.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminality, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to verge activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army to monitors the online content and people who have thrown into being monarchy is prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand establishes a strictly speaking against "Lese Majeste" (majesty sinsult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">The War of War was proclaimed in Thailand on 20 May 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that Junta continue to purchase is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts they were warning that the purchase is unnecessary and waste of tax-control.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video will even be shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before taking them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in prison, because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and cause Internet users to curb long prison sentences, they should insulting the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the songs of the band called the Salut "Tribute from" The Tribute of Panem, "which was already used by Putin's opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1805">It has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian-abian war officially ended, but its scars are still visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern suburbs in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are in the hydrocarpark of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, depreciation and Armenians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and Abkhavases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost cities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war era even more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these violins.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of 16,000 had grown to 16.000 people after it had barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1818">"all this is a result of war"</seg>
<seg id="1819">The empty five-story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s, called Chruschtschukowkas, are symbolically for the decline and desolation of the region.</seg>
<seg id="1820">The buildings are expired and quite rarely, they are inhabited by more than two families.</seg>

<seg id="1823">At the entrance of Dzhantukha village I met a local elderly man.</seg>
<seg id="1824">He starts a conversation and it is difficult to finish this.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"all this is a consequence of war."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"can I talk to you?" "why don't you talk?</seg>
<seg id="1827">It is still clear. "</seg>
<seg id="1828">Before the war the village was full of life.</seg>
<seg id="1829">There were community centers, schools and kindergartens served all of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with remaining splendour buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and with their contribution to the central planing economy of the Soviet Union, have left the district meanwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1832">Around fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of Dzhantukha.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar.</seg>
<seg id="1834">The Khrushchev, which is still one or two families, one sees the balconies where laundry is dried.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Two young girls, both seven years old, look out of the window of a destroyed house.</seg>
<seg id="1836">When they discovering me with the camera in his hand, they retire immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"our Mother is forbidden to make us a photo," says one of the girls.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"why?" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1839">The girl whispers a little bit to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called Tkuarchalugol.</seg>
<seg id="1841">Families are also involved in the farming industry (cultivation of agricultural products for personal use) such as livestock breeding, beekeeping and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="1842">It is difficult to get over the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The district management provides free candles and bread on their villages in winter.</seg>

<seg id="1847">About ten years ago, an older woman with the name Galina (or aunt Galya, as it is called in the neighborhood) from Akarmara to Jhantukha.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Despite their oldest daughter who lives in France, Galina does not have to leave Abchasia to live with her. "my heart will remain forever in Abchasia," she told her.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Galina does not want to accept financial aid by her daughter, and insisted that she supports her young grandson instead.</seg>
<seg id="1850">Galatians monthly pension are just nine dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1851">"if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house, it's hard to survive," she is too.</seg>
<seg id="1852">Aunt Galya is telling that they and other villagers try to meet regularly and celebrate public holidays.</seg>

<seg id="1858">While she tells her story, a younger neighbour appears on the balcony.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"Natascha," calls for Tante Galya. "they said, we could build courgettes.</seg>

<seg id="1861">I don't know what will happen, but we will build courgettes. "</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you can get used to everything"</seg>
<seg id="1863">Galyas talks in Natascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in their home for some time.</seg>
<seg id="1864">Natascha was 11 years old when the war began.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Every day they remembers the village in front of the war.</seg>
<seg id="1866">Despite the relatives who live in Central Russia, Ossetia and Georgia (the country Abchasia was simply gone), they didn't have the opportunity to leave it.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, where he is on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year old Mexican female, a small woman with a corallen-pink frame and golden earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. yet, they know many of Mama Africa name.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel rather has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2,50 Dollar the night sleeping in simple rooms, with grinding, abovable walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - still hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells us people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast begin to call her: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present, it's more quiet but this year RamÃ­rez welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on antons outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medication that they could not pay, they massed them with a balm that exhaustive from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurt hat) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil, hoping to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel it fits to it because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States, normally make a first stop in South America and then go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," Felix Michelet, a guest of Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel the way together and that Africans speak already on WhatsApp by Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest for Mum Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let her go again," he answered smiling. "we will always be in touch with us."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells her guests to send text messages when they are gone to report them or to report her over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught to prepare the chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is very well known here, but she is not the only sparking hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their little home.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the Bustickets have to be sold too expensive to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on the ground floor, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was transferred to a raid on his office from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who had fled from him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single one he has offered her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives again and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the House of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travelers keep calm their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but it's also nostalgic because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she hides her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hairpin which you made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers, boy and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs, while she imagines her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya'fuerone," repeated them every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users, the foreman's foreman.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone received a mobile phone in the Tianshan district of Urumqi. in which she attends the District Government to install a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the message, the app is said to prevent access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities will also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app with a private WeChat Group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the press release, the app was able to determine and track the sources and distributing paths of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwaning website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a service provider with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, of online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users alert, how much time they can spend online and to remote control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors will help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote" remote actors "or even hackers could manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While news on digital censorship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, displaced ethnic minorities like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censored and surveillance measures as well as regular Internet connections.</seg>
<seg id="1976">This is based on Twitter based media outlet "Images from The China" (foreseman, foreman), the censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where the policemen were able to check if they had the monitoring app installed.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected on a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use devices that are intended for older people to use.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the observation technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from the China" (foreman's foreman) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can highlight the password requirements of a Windows operating system and therefore unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize proliferation of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and the party related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs, up to 1 August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media storage cards."</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy. however, this action violates personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a whole range of other possible clubs, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="1994">This is the first of six reports in a row of "sleep or death," in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane has posted its experiences in a Syrian prison.</seg>

<seg id="1997">One who makes all honor her name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One who has settled in a list of feelings and expressions, do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But if you bring your reality back and look behind the scenes, beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - transform the characters into being of flesh and blood, and everything screams after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubts dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even if the earth moves on the axis of the evil one. you will clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents, and before them have established your grandparents, stone by stone.</seg>

<seg id="2002">He exhibited his power over us, by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers have been ripped during a peaceful protest, such as weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough so that the city crossed the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the quarters were coveted, but not my own.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, rainy days, even if I had no high demands on a city that is up to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night things had a little reassuring, after the power supply stopped in the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence by crying several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice withhall the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to meet together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Many friends, true friends closed to me; we allied to a glorious image that filled my expectations full and full.</seg>
<seg id="2013">In such a moment, you are aware that you get the spirit out of the lamp, but it simply doesn't care in the least.</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "makes you ready to meet us at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you your voice, after you gave it all the way up to the office of security from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I joined there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I now also.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The Colonel Ghassan begins to speak: "let me hear how you cry 'Allahu', or you are only brave enough to scream if we are not nearby."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hatchfilled eyes were set up in me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you know what to look for me in the eyes, and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then, has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood before this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Perhaps it was on my folly, vanity; perhaps in the revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure as I said: "I would not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">And I think I have never stopped to look at your eyes, so why should I do it now? "</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I regret not a word from what I said.</seg>

<seg id="2029">"his father is the same with us."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed proposition lies down to me in the nose today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">He became a "syndrome," an Irish torture that I was exposed to months.</seg>
<seg id="2032">I pierced the farm.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office, I leave everything I carry with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Then again through the farm and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the single cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I imprint all the details exactly before I supervised the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Unlike otherwise, they probably have dealt a bigger cell this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share them with just one another prisoner, and may immediately sit down without waiting its permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After some minutes, who felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I grabbed an old proven communication method: with his fist against the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I knew that my sighting was a "whomelling."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long time, he ultimately answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently in any of the surrounding cells there was a respected man of middle ages, which looks similar to me and "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In perfect darkness there is no striking faces of mind, and doctors do not exist here; we are all just numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers are connected to its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved into one of the large cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigators had assured me, they would love him if I remain.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liar.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would like to have had a scarecrow in order to drive all these crows that labelled towards the fruit in the garden of my head labs.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From the distance, I still hear "Allahu 'Akbar."</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be at approximately 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the cry of screams, every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the most of his times inside. once again he shuffles to his computer, go to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can leave, is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and had forced to flee from their village to Palestine in which she lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Since six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who is the conservative daily opposed to the conservative majority, and she asks about gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and rapist.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as a man who is not restricted in his mind, and he can feel according to his own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not supply it openly, it sweeps against the US foreign policy a special dislike.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believes not that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as "Palestinian favor of the second generation," so he himself was born even if he was born in Jordan, and so far he was never in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own life circumstances," emphasizes Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think, because I'm a man," while living in water over two cups, it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public eating is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a senseling hot young woman has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the muginity lurk coffee and the squadron of the kent cigarette in the nose into the first place of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one throws a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, one avoids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - in order to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior of the Interior of Jordaniens has cancelled a performance in the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary groups that support the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - arguing that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier Hamed Sinno, has contradicated the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press-press officer of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" because of the sexual orientation of the singers have been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2113">In addition, many pretend, the commitment of the band in matters of Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activism that authorise the old legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as a progressive supporter of human rights, who still decided to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply silky rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality reflects in Jordan that occurs in Hdaibs work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib used traditional gender equality by forming his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vorelied sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an exposed unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually have confidence.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, Jordan has increased the number of "honours' - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch, according to its culmination, reached its peak in 2016. however, Jordan was added to the institutional infrastructure that Jordan has become an institutional or domestic violence that tried to assist murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law in breaking out of the year 1954, women who are exposed to danger from domestic violence, "for her release is often a longlong bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee on the part of the family, that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for it, also not frighten on themes that remain in the country for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, he is dreaming that he does not separate his music, which is full of explicit concerns on sexuality, freedom and freedom of expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come out of the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">He became a reflection of politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song named "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically active in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is also."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words, "which you want," be faith or not believe Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya to memorize that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a modified version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals is not speaking to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in mind thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuis supposed to work later on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanians do it?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought into silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian newspaper service adopted several former government officials and members of the course of the association, with the reasoning, they could have expressed themselves in social media in the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs said only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent giving and taking. Jordan has now denied a performance for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, bedrock and internal changes. it is sure that changes from day to day will take place at the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also dreams of an Arab world without interventions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreaming not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem, and Damascus, but also of them, "they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be annulled by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading and artificial nature. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it's done, Hdaib will continue to rap and resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually taken in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory says that the Festing invaded the east of Japan in the armies of the west of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus, most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historical center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street smob and illegal drug trafficking are daily.</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for men's aesthetic services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), has led to more normal brushes in the experienced hands of hairdressers, who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">An exceptional demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts stand against each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks that can be seen in the following video (more videos about current contests can be found on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions, such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad advice to find training in hairdressing, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities you've seen dozens of young people that they can take a job is currently in fashion.</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the message "declaration of guerrilla" to have published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The post is published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is there not much more important, people who feel ejected to bring affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went out to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the young-Youth Foundation and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la FortulaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation) that encourages young people to write guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to do their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the Guerillamovement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered so significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But the columbians is still a long way, until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived for many years in illegal camps, exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock carried their weapons with themselves, must now be back into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which in turn to life in fear and in some cases, had accustomed to their ranks and in some cases, it must now support them in their ranks and support them in creating a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly this did they do: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - message messages to former guerrilla ships to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla war - which should then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was made on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love to write on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those who need to do much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, in this year he told his love to share with people who needed most urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan, letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now have to place their place in society, and to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a military story with a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would forgive '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung BogotArt traveled to the camp to deliver letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Members of the FARC appeared as they used to take the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters of full support of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that is in between," told the policy scientific student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former soldier led me through the camp of Guerilla fighter.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut, where the guerrilla movement) saw, I saw a guerrilla who wrote somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegrower, a lethal weapon in the bush.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I said, "Hello, what are they doing now?" he said, "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something like nice, so I answer it. "I suddenly started tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him whole and sat down beside the Granatcher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something else from life expectedly as war. to join the FARC, it was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the hunger strike. "I had never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society without waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together as a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised as war and the FARC had already been in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insights into their views on the peace process: "many years we have experienced how the social injustice due to evolve into a political party, we can help to make the society more fairer in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a purpose of this magnitude, it pays to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people, who had never heard before and had no electoral law, and to recognize that the people I had often seen as a monster, even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their lives and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, woe to me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who killed and have caused so much harm to give us a little and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the archbishop of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbians was prophesied that after the disarmament, peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">Long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are willing to raise up to the weapons and to protest their rights, and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those under us who defend life as the basis of existence will gain many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2262">When I was doing just a few grocery bags from the back seat of my car I heard a male say: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen: "how long will you still honor the family?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up the last end at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had taken everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two swords in my right lungs.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were they laid - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name; but the doctor understood and laid me down to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats to last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, and wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a trauma.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to send me back to Chechnya to prove that this was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it, and I say that I didn't change my sex in Grozny, and I say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad things, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother got too much and she put a snck around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, a car with a darkened window plate and a plate plate with a 95 margin.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked their license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to give up their name, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unexpected happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration, without reference, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke down my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and check in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you believe in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already, in which hotel you plug. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This really was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">We don't talk about the gender equality, however, that is a tabusubject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome these seelic barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person from her past - thus in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who are dorded?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who gave one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan, he was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That I mean, they probably charge the relative, they take care of the problem with the person affected and at the end demand an evidence that the so-called "honour" has experienced through blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there would be no many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no wealthy relatives or were dropped by their relatives to put the cadyrows of court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there to present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they allegedly attacked some village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people weren't just vanished, but subordinated specifically to radialize yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a mutation or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I was doing someone who was imprisoned in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after her beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was with us when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not introduced as bandits, but there were no reports about that. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not be allowed to shave these people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe I was already known already in the year 2003 when I was still living there - and I had never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I had never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to lead us to the "Civilization," but ultimately led us back to the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were knocked; I had colored eyelashes, kept tubjeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia had never confessed me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and all the city knew thereof; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen Language there is a Redemple: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spot is not on the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say to children, when people make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have her eyes closed to you because they believed they were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period end?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us by se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, you could feel like the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who suffered and laughed before and laughed at once with Argosh.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic has steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still active as activists.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, gatherings, I talented them to the hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend any penny.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered this man myself when I klaped them.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you have a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's it.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So, nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who wants to hide you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no coils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans who have the cabiners who have the Russians have also who, on the entire planet, are they - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it's unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and fasting throughout the Ramadan, live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think in Transidentism of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase in self-moral within the armed Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arabian population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For the past few months, there has been a strong increase in self-murder.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: usage with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jasmine Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, influenced by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed for his own helplessness that can arise incompetence for his family, so Ahwazi-human rights groups that are working in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube took the moments when he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly put the flames back, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani-Hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that has acquired himself in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on site warn that more men could get their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and unable to nourish their family because of the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and unable to pursue their families.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is based in a large part of Iran-based Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to deny the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was primarily autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the region of Ahwaz, there are some of the largest in Iran occurring oil and gas fields as well as some of the most experienced and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated disorders, hunger and deduction.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime uses the ancestry regimes systematically in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a multitude of dams, the waters from the Arab regions in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are running.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to destroy the devastation in the region through drought caused destruction, and local agriculture as well as fish and palms.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperative, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis concluded a job, completed the primary school, 55% have completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy that aim to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Kenimi, an Iranian nuclear activist, resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "said to a" high rise "in the number of self-moral among the young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Kenimi said that especially unemployment has become worse and worse. reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions not prefered to the Arab forces, the local Arab Ahwazi will subside access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">It is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aim to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside of their home Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances, the Arab Ahwazi alone must endure, strike human rights activists, before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world is waking up and informed of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, as well as with the interseduction"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ayomide and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who themselves describe themselves as an interdisciplinary feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well through scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money than men, despite the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling earlier or later in various fields of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still passing through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of that and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I'm a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I have to speak on skin color, on black cis women, on black transsift women, to black transsift women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the diaspora; if I mention, both in and outside the feminist movement, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all of them are, however, that women - all women - come together to "sing their voices and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing" to achieve equal rights (some) women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about sexualised violence in addition to sexualised violence that we are exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethniers and spending less deserve as white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls are more often referred to in school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with migrant background to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all the men and all men of any kind of skin have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join as black women, who refused to consider injustices in their thinking, which relate to gender as well as skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm tired and I'm not going to fight my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spontaneity that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In her speech in 1851, Sojourner mourned in her words: "I am not a wife?" and I also refuses to maintain a ideology where the black woman is a human and marginalised nature.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I feed myself to connect groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs of customs, to push their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to settle white women the importance of overcutting of skin color and gender. because some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to insure them for better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectarian feminism was founded to stop women of various approaches and differentiate from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I draw it to me full and entirely of feminism, who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman in my life instead of a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that interseagality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and embarked on us in the spheres which we are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves, in which they are perfectly safe, and in which the cultural, mental, seelic, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and internal feminists are immediately called Separatism and exclusion, please inform you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can feel black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am acknowledged because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life has not overlooked, nor ignored, nor denied.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddeling against the pollution: the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">This post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="2468">In the context of a content-sharing agreement, this article will be published again.</seg>
<seg id="2469">Again, in the past 7 years, MaiMusa traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with a surf board or a special request by the Kurdistan Kurdistan in Iraq. its mission aims to deliberately make people's importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region, and the impact of pollution to its church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," Musa tells us.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is involved in protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa explains the urgency and importance of his work together in one question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">The video was filmed and edited by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist in Erbil, in Erbil, Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The emphasis of their work lies on the pursued, little considerable subcultures and is characterized by using cooperative video photography and new multimedia techniques, with their help suppressed communities that can tell their stories in their way.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the number # PorSerMujer (# reflicheinous), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez, that she could not do anything against Luis Balbuena, her exams that would have been violent against it.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police said, their statement would be laid to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When a further woman showed Balbuena for abuse, also the accurate display of Ada BÃ¡ez was useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman went back her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women may reimburse any ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men that they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence is at all to report to the investigative authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inde1 blows and statistical abuse and a legal system that has nothing underground laws: good approach, lack of action and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to see how many women truly harassed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, a researcher in scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports which, however, do not even accumulate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available at disposal are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General has registered 9600 ads due to domestic violence. at 70% of them it went around violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence at the peace courts. here 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the indicators, 40% of women claimed that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, show not the true severity of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these offences will actually appear. "on each woman, who will not be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who are charged with physical abuse, two women who do not do this, "commented at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murders in Paraguay has no own offense, the investigative authorities cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The ordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, a woman dies in Paraguay every ten days due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was born the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she should repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos. however, she bore the mental violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and simultaneously the most notable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I thought that this only happens to subjection to women, because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked the rhetoric if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long from Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who comes not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay in order to prove that their former partner fought them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network of Yo te Creo ("I think you"), which consists of women all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk with others about their experiences, listening to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to strike them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias Advertise with the authorities without the result and also of their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a lawsuit against her former partner who developed into a continuous legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country, mainly for money, power and influence of its former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">World laws: good approach, deficient implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of abuse is a way full of resistors and a fight against corruption in justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also provides great problems with the laws of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 in the paraguayan Parliament, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# FÃ¼ress).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the motion # NiUnaMenos (# Noninclusions) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law looks forward to explain Femizid to an independent crime-continuance and harder to punish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the statestext was changed in some points to also win the deputies for the law that the way for the decriminalization of abortions that are currently forbidden in Paraguay and are punished by up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had foreseen, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process of process that the victims of violence have to bear in mind, if they just want to refund and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislator has no sufficient financial means available for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse are seen as part of human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a circumstance must take place so that violence is not considered something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in view of these facts is guilty, and carries with that the perpetrators cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must restore so long until abuse is not considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Law was adopted in the paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law were altered, but among other things, a passage was painted, which the partners had called domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was considered an opportunity for the aggressor, to attack his victims again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law applies however as great setbacks.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the number # PorSerMujer (# reflicheinous), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Most names were changed to the protection of the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Independent Media in Oman one year after prohibition of a newspaper remains exposed to attacks</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this website was locked due to a decision by the information minister" on the website of the forbidden newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Cuban authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn due to its coverage on corruption in the Sultanant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he served a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim al-Maamari and zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried by court, but came back later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been reigns since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said who came to power after he had his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a state of coup.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultans reign is characterised by the persistently effort of security forces, in particular of domestic power, including freedom of freedom, including press freedom, independent journalists, blogger and further activists, intimidated and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hindering citizens, also activists, to express their views on public affairs as such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn newspaper, the closure and the arrest of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, where since its foundation in 2007 was reported about corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces took place Ibrahim al-Maamari, chief editor of Azamn, who was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title "High-ranking parties" hands on the judiciary. "in this, we went to corruption in the judicial and the interference of high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials were accused of lifting the judges of the Supreme Court of Oman, to raise the judgment in a inheritance.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, zahn Al-Abri, Member of the Board of Directors, was invited to the special department at the ISS before and upon arrival of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS drew the Deputy Editor Yousef Al-Haj, who was agitated after Al-Maamaris arrest as chief editor.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed at an indefinite period after the Information Secretary had given the order, "the publication and spreading of the newspaper on any way, including online, as of August 9, 2016 is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial was held in the trial of the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Tribunal sentenced three journalists to prison and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of interruption of public order, "abuse of the Internet," and "Subsient of the Preparation of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of an audience and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three year prison sentences and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars), and an old professional ban imposed on the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1,000 Rial (2600 US dollars), after the use of an information network for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a damages deposit of 5000 omanic riial (13 000 US dollars) was priced and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgement of judgement.</seg>
<seg id="2570">At a hearing held on 26 December 2016, the Appeals Court acquitted Al-Haj sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after expulsion of his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Mascat. al-Haj is still in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Court of Appeal overturned the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the court to regain Azamn, the newspaper looks like before attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January the Information Minister made an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and wherewith the Minister set up again for the decision of the Appeals Court to publish the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has recently been injured in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For example, the closing of the website of the independent journal Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad include the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the lasting closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the Cuban authorities are still not prepared to make an end to an end of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the Cuban authorities on:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditional release;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn so that their journalists may follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect press freedom in the country</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need of medical research, there are two reasons: for the demand of the global health sector there are many medicines and vaccines covering the special medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa have far more severe effects than elsewhere, and missing investments in the discovery of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists itself, is capable of establishing own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">It grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the news about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambish national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion of the most important scientific issues in your country and commonly in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we just set solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being murders.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Solutions that we get are often not suitable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is she sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special science education starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research for world trauma, health care (not transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are limited speed, things to do, and the given access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only available for payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" producers change world-wide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine, which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding the salad of the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as outshredths, the first plant grown by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>

<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more Salate was patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only available for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or wrapped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last years more such patents have always been registered for growing plants such as cereals or cartridges. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food safety for food security to the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still growing, but it is now longer needed since its work will always be worth more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's as if I lie in a river a boulders, so that I must dull.</seg>

<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new ointment, because all features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tried to breed those features that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and striving to use no material, which is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It is also connected to a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breedings).</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement originates from the IT field, and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source "seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, the alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created in life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders are able to agree that others may use the farmed seed freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seeds and the possibility to breed new plants as well as food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds are according to it, according to biodiversity as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breaching seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "to achieve the most common examples of organic farming or Monsanto and Bayer, which is also offered on farming markets, should also know that the way that this vegetables is bred, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereign without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative agree to keep others free seed-free. in contrast, its approach as opposed to patented seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted, incessantly corrupt.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and availability. she found out that about a third of all card characteristics is protected as intellectual property, which makes it impossible for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are not such estimates, but experts like Luby suspect that foods such as wheat are patented as wheat in even greater style as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, through which its taste or color improved to such, because they prosper in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more than ever more patents. genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever before, as the changing conditions are much worse than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email spokesperson for Monsanto, Carly Scaduto is recognizing that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genbangles and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company is responsible for maintaining the genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts that intellectual property retrench other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varied Innovation." "a patent is basically taken into a plan that can abide by as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection is not inhibits innovations, but encourages more material and know-how to provide the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years of waiting for a patent that is certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow to plants, which have been adapted to the changed environment conditions, one would have lost the fight already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources should always have been a general good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to help farmers to make their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us, and it will be impossible if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferes with the concept to patented plant features: "we do not really create the features.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds a variety, and raise its own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Who believes in industrial agriculture with great farms and monoculation, for their cultivation of cultivation herbicide are needed, which is cultivated in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (those who operate on international markets but smaller than Monsanto's) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either refuse it to be expensive and therefore keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant-owned Frank Morton seeks to look for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders by the Avoid of plant patents would be innovative: "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors have to sell my varieties in a few years, "he says." with a patent you are protected for 20 years before the competition, with which in my opinion it simply makes it quite beautiful. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seem to be a leader in the Open Source "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, a "Open-Source" seed programme is working together with farmers and helps them to grow new varieties which meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell its own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agreements are working on an Open-Source Code, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, absent because of the Ossi obligation not simply can be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive branch of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventional disciplined plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, the patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">But a statement is not yet a law; now it is in governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" seeds systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seeds, NGOs and seeds from all East Africa to learn about the "Open Source" seed movement and the worldwide trend to cultivating seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for "Open Source" seed systems declared that the organization is currently developing a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems which should be planned for planned next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger between environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed-map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report that farmers have to be able to exchange and improve seed politics, making it possible to share and improve the seed policies, so that a stable supply can be ensured using food supplies.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is also stresses - a connection, by the Luby of Ossi, hopes it will see it soon.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and as something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," so Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time the site of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August, the Egyptian government locked up the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network released a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities criticised this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first zenly site of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites like e.g. the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera from Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of westery bulations fell victim to the victim. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is also no access to Egypt's blog and human rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog was built to handle the zenge of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which the destination of Ziadas blog is native, but is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and took a video that carried out physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article revolves mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the lock by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfatally al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs is probably not important for the world, it is for me it is for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It happened to them to mediate the feeling of an siege of an siege; an attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the lock blogs, and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even though only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to item articles to deal with censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, having blocked him, and that they may be afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented barriers of providers by changing online censorship and private surfing possible, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPN)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites, which we offer VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content to the Egyptian user.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is intensified that the censored decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed to the court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for tag newspapers in whole Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard pictures.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Each second day a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "thieves' pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and air force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a sharp financial situation, the violence of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian No Global Justice organisation called for even the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; you will find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">Thus, for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16 the Editorial "This is not normal," in which they agreed to set up a new column called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for her decision declares the paper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crime that happen in any major city on the world, like murder, robbery, sexuality loss, etc. all, which happened in Rio, will be published in the column "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so we do not close our eyes before cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor-editor of the newspaper, that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with war rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist discovered that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorials the newspaper writes further:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war course, if it is distorted, can also be used to shift cruelines of the police, which only shoots and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose purpose is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harms longer than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira is arguing the violence as a "war."

<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - in combination with the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, reconnaissance and historical and selfeitful neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">According to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is wrong, according to CecÃ­lia is wrong: "22 of the 30 nonviolent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 to the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">If we look at the murder rate per state, Rio is on position 16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, emphasises such as CecÃ­lia, has been repeating the policy of security for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To these safety policies, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit generated by the state of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to capture a favela by using a massive police station and permanently stationed a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">Initially, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. in a few years, the UPP could actually protect against the poor communes and pressions against poor churches, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page published by journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux, from one of his articles from the year 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this requires the state to use a means and ways, which are typical for a war. this is the penetration into the territory of a "enemy," with which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for "collateral damage" and "irritated bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War on or forth, Fact is that the residents of the favelas suffer from Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week it is now, that the police attacked the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho, to get the death of a police officer.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Among all these violence also made headlines: a fruit retailer died due to shots, which had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011, and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victory Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PAX and the Research Institute, The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta, where an attack of chemical weapons in August 21, 2013, is particularly affected by hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights of human rights that massacred the massacre of the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebels have stood under siege under siege under siege under siege under siege under siege under siege under siege and instructed by tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">By years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">In contrast, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghouta as they can plant their own fungi as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They themselves call themselves ghiras Allowda and lead the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi not belong to the traditional, in Syria planted food products and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, it makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The directs of the project, Abo, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, like meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, that has been fighting for the project for three years, and expressed its relief, that it is now more and more "awareness wins."</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, use the NGO Ghiras Alnahda the humanitarian crowdfunding platform Cando.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families to convey the plantation of fungi, as Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached 100% of its expected target of approximately 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations from Cando until Monday, 04. September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators, which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally manufactured fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they started with the "production from the regions of the fungus," before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. when this was accomplished they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have created a "teaching farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the start of the project and after more than 3 months, they have spread the mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protesting in many suburbs in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that warmed up in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two and forty people died, and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fireworks eruptions that spread to the northern and central regions of the country, and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande a similar tragedy, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in Portugal, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area from the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make you a better picture of the serious situation: there are no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2843">Numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the events:</seg>
<seg id="2844">The seeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The goal of protests from Saturday was the demand for better preemptive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People asked why civil protection had not been able to curb the extent of tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral explained by the Federation of the farmers of Portugal to the pÃºblico newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o, roads and villages became evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">They didn't do that Sunday: there are dozens of open streets, surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria a similar tragedy would happen again as in June, because the streets were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">Furthermore, construction permits will be questioned in locations with a high industry risk.</seg>
<seg id="2852">An extensive proposal for a turning-form, which brought the government according to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was approved by the Communes, which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a sling of the law, which case the activity of the case was permitted, if the applicant could have a means of self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," leads JoÃ£o Sorval to pÃºblico on the same article.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus made aware that large areas with eucalyptus trees made of slightly flammable wood, like in a vicious circle, according to fires of this kind always spread out.</seg>
<seg id="2855">On these problems, the site of the Civil Protection of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, as a resident of information, sought to contact people who was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information provided the people used their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real-time on the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched by the developers JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of fire brigade in 2015, so that the servers pursued the onslaught of the 400,000 users, which pursued the fires, didn't stand the site more than half a million.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by the Taliban were murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt grieved.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban were getting closer to their hatred at the Hazara-known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara forsook the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his small wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar, the heavier than he himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was affected by misery and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open window, so we did not indulge at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf created his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food in need.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy, due to relatively high conditions, is a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers are in the country is disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers is housed in the more than 3000 "special entrance centers," they are improvised in the hands of unqualified and unqualified personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre, if they officially have an application for asylum, which can still be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, need either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his indisputable life helped to free Asharaf soon from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf spent his total savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while and opened a small limbus.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject of documentation "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghan people live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of Afghan companies, including cutting equipment, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience in which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells about the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari in Padua opened the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Kabulogna Pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs goals are far beyond the Italian food industry and retail, and aim to return to the country that he had to leave for a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"wherever a risk is, there are possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country, and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same options as all the others. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also adorns plans for opening a factory in Kabul where people can learn packaging and conservicing techniques. "thus, they can sell their harvest cords on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The successful entrepreneur was a trip through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help others to help others in this path.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Netizen report: legislation from Egypt offer discontinued social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo of @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot, which shows challenges, victories and upcoming trends in the world's Internet</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian Parliament enters a draft bill, which previews that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a governmental department.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to use the social networks to be able to use social networks, within six months of successful law casting on the website of the authority using its complete name as well as their identity number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to a penalty of up to six months or the end of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty members of Parliament, is currently under legislative and the constitutional committee of Parliament and should be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, a legislative proposal submitted a proposal to be introduced to the tougher penalties for the insult of the president or high officials.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insult of the President and state facilities are already punishable. however, such act would be punishable with prison and fines, such as right-wing of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is adopted, this can mean by three years in prison for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would be a political climate, in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud plan ZID (known as Shawkan), when he was captured by the Egyptian police officers, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who led against the military coup led to the president of the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan looked like more than 700 participants who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison on a court date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th May, because of human rights groups, the defendants will fail to bring the defendants from prison in the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree, headlights of inter alia weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and an attempt murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza spoke two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary freely. they were charged for their coverage to the pro-morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the sentence of journalists Abdullah al-Fharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested for the previously mentioned incident, 25 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists listen to scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities have six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was primarily heard on a negotiated action plan. Besagter plan was supported by the President of the Republic, which would explicitly provide a controversial draft by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document issued on the 21st of April on the page of Nawaat, casts a light on how the preparatory plans look like to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia has rejected the naming of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists ensure the right to protection of their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">However, he entered the District Court in Tunis, on May 09, as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media, to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the National Council of the People's Office of China, the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the regulations it is stated that the registration with full reels will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this should be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks. it is unclear until now, how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese supplies have proposed in social media, to impose these rules only selective to protect the journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then see we in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese Messaging App WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat settled to register as the organiser of the information distribution. "</seg>
<seg id="2961">This name is part of a law from the year 2014, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that the government does not allow the government to act responsibly for removing content and force them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnobyniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court owns Sperm Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court disposed of the lock Wikipedias in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English speaking articles, the indications that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, maritime affairs and communication has been imprisoned, because they collaborated on "a source of information related to groups to attack a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey has blocked the website completely. it is in addition to China, one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop, herdling</seg>
<seg id="2968">Following this week, the UK government is located in the midst of a deliberate consultation with increased surveillance, which would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and to encrypt the data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted the telecommunications company and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civil population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until 19. may. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
