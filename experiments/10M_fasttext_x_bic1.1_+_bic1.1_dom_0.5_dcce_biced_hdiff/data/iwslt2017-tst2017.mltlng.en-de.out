this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times rep@@ orter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter , that should leave a lasting impression .
in this case , he describes a cat@@ astro@@ phic US secret operation in which the CIA was literally handed out to Iran for an atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but you know who did not like the chapter like that ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years the government was determined against R@@ isen and called it to name its alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ te they give .
so when the government came with R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous rep@@ orter had already done before him , he refused and said that he would rather go into prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had years stated that it would be indispensable for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : during the time of electronic monitoring , the Reporter and springs can hide and hide .
instead of failure and sm@@ ash to asser@@ t , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his phone wise is concerned ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit information , and even travel documents with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , Justice has more condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how it can be a problem , especially because the government is home to much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the media work on the game that is supposed to be protected by the first constitu@@ tion@@ aries , because the government has more possibilities to sp@@ ying all of them .
but just as technology of the government allowed to deal with rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed they can contact us from the moment in which they contact , rather than in h@@ ind@@ sight , in the witness .
today there are communication software that has not yet been written as R@@ isen has written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet iconic , which was developed by us Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to an news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload or send documents , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency access has access .
so the government cannot take more information secretly , and many of the information they would like would not be available from the out@@ set .
Secure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole , to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world develop new spy technologies that all end@@ anger ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to report about ab@@ uses in the supply of soldiers hum@@ d and over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for the contaminated drinking water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
these technologies were not only made for those who want to expos@@ e crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness in order to make an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness by a statement . &#93; This week we were looking for news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s resident firm - Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see e @-@ mails , sharing of messages like the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad suff@@ ers for tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead on a close friend of children days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait annoying to the next release , and to the next disclos@@ ed documents .
it sounds like the Plot of a agency name or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems weeping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do what ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for major public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discus@@ sing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something that we will discuss and reveal their assets for ten years .
I think many people will very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always put it like a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ d@@ ap@@ u@@ ppe in front of me .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who behind these brothers .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there have been no more prominent Americans having occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no weal@@ thy Americans to hide their assets in control .
but through the principle , after which this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US states , less information needs to give less information to start a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts allowed to wi@@ pe school@@ children .
it has authorized to wi@@ pe especially an@@ odi@@ ous ji@@ b .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent an uncovered investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself an African minister , who wanted to bring money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked that everyone could make suggestions for a lawyer , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ judi@@ ces . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to the money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who under@@ took suggestions for our covered investig@@ ator .
it does not go to a single top pol@@ arity , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
to cope with this , we have to change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior complain .
this may sound great , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if it will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change .
over the past few years we have seen demonstrations at more transparency , affecting the owners of companies .
political attention was conducted by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then the EU covers in central regist@@ ers on the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US has lag@@ ging behind here .
representatives of both parties involved a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this is not the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama disclos@@ ure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are fur@@ ious when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
we need exec@@ u@@ tives in the economy , which arise and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians to realise the problem and to do it by law this kind of in@@ transparency .
together we can finally stop the in@@ transparency , which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace team .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land on the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me saying , &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Ask , how please ? &quot;
at night I was in bed , I stayed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in ?
a wild alien sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I was such a fear I got out of the bed , ti@@ gh@@ ten to toe , and shut up my sleeping door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art bought from me is today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as hosts . it has changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreign lands , are actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered ?
back people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let us take a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my ro@@ omm@@ ate draws off and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
I think that creativity can make it be afraid to turn into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have thought about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay in a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at the air floor for 20 dollars on the air floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ et was completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door went into the castle , I star@@ red Brian and me .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into the rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people publicly available pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can invite the foreign people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the miss@@ ile would ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
no one who is yet completely in comfort would invest in a store which allows strangers to sleep in apartments other people .
why ?
because as children have lear@@ nt all that foreigners are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you get on the things you can see . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we have learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immen@@ sely confidence that had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degrees we trust in .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort one .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locked cell phone your left sitting ro@@ omm@@ ates .
this silent adventure of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time .
for the only thing that is still personal when your mobile phone is , is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell of a stranger in my hands ?
most people feel responsibility .
this makes most of the guests feel free if they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just once , who now has Al Go@@ res phone ?
could you announce on Twitter that he may serve as President of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor would have imagined first with his name , if he would have told whence he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you could have 150 judges who say : &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative assess@@ ments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their reservations before we set them online .
last week , we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are similar to the age and residence .
little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most like us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
it is a natural social pre@@ judi@@ ci@@ ve .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assess@@ ments .
if you have fewer than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation of common simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted prefer@@ ences .
in addition , we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you can get from yourself .
here you see the reactions on the first news of a guest .
if you are telling too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
tells us too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- if the request is not accepted .
so there is an optimal level of op@@ enness , e. g &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m happy with my family vacation . &quot;
how to create it with design , to make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct quantity text . we also give tips on which themes you should write something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
which we had@@ n &apos;t reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than prepared to leave these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people are taking our offer .
you can recognize three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that has not been covered before .
for us the shop runs very well .
of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
I worked in customer service at the beginning of the project . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front door when confidence has been broken .
there is nothing worse than that calls . it &apos;s hurt when I &apos;m just thinking about it .
the dis@@ appointment , which is heard in the voice of the c@@ aller , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us .
fortunately , from the 123 million nights only a fra@@ ction was one problem .
for people trust each other to just@@ ify each other .
if trust works , there can be mira@@ culous .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who are subject to sitting activities on heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true gu@@ ardian , who can save one &apos;s life , although they know not at all .
you drive one in your own car at the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they do not want you feel lonely , they bring books by .
they can stay longer and stay longer without charging the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay run off .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
this is an economic trading here .
but it just doesn &apos;t just call &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing is not just .
share Economy describes a trading that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if you are traveling to fast food nowadays , it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic but less authentic .
what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if you were interested in every place one would have visited , a group there would have been waiting to be a thorough approach and show one in a pub tour of which one has never heard of ;
or if you could cook a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from the reason ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing ?
I introduce cities , which allow ourselves to society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and am@@ ination .
this project has already begun in the South Korean capital of Seoul . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
are now offered residents . students who were looking for a lead ,
were trained to people whose children were moved . there were incub@@ ators for incubation .
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , over our platform today , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be host to a stranger or themselves .
so the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were already similar websites for us .
so why did it work ?
apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the ingredients of trust .
design can help us overcome more deep pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find it start@@ ling ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it whenever a red Maz@@ da is passing by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I ask myself what we can use design for soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a hor@@ tic@@ ist ?
or just a delay in security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the fault for your negative impressions .
so the media form people , which look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know any Muslims .
presumably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met one Muslims : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee house -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ eg@@ ra @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a pract@@ ising , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sang , because , baby , I was not born this way .
I have chosen this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ gh@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual human being , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to bear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I did not only accept the faith of my parents .
I have to do with the basket .
I read it , thought in question , dou@@ b@@ ted and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion , deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k will sometimes bring me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever felt the feeling you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
I later married and began as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had been folded to the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned quickly into anger .
why should one do such a thing ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
not only my country has been attacked but in the N@@ u converted me to the deeds of others from a citizen in a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin building studies .
I remember how to spur me -- as we sil@@ ently drove -- as deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; assemble you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
again , the warnings : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were under@@ stand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were with Muslims who were torn apart and killed .
there were really Bran@@ dan on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country , have attacked our country .
I have put the anger of the people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain themselves continually .
I have no questions , I love questions .
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the US .
is it just the question : are we mal@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and ben@@ ign tumor only under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , not tum@@ our in the body of the US , but an important organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Aes@@ thetic and Olymp@@ ion@@ ics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make more secure ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people other beliefs toler@@ ant , and major citizen participation .
as a leader of the police in Washington , DC recently told me , people are actually not radi@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the Radi@@ c@@ alization process , one has noticed that it starts online . the person believes that the person is believed to do a bra@@ in@@ ous group , that the person believes the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ c@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS fo@@ unds their brut@@ ality with the cor@@ an .
as Muslims , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination , if one recogni@@ zes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology in their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but if you have a look at them , she does not drive on what they were blown in their &quot; Holy Scri@@ pture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which they read these things in Scri@@ pture .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me a recently amazing story :
a girl came to him because she could have joined the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , brought them to silence , and told her that their wrath , their sense of in@@ justice in the world , would bring them into difficulties .
inspired by anything and something that could make sense of their anger , it was an main goal for the instrument@@ alization through extrem@@ ists who promised a solution .
this im@@ am gave the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ use her for their anger , he showed their con@@ structive ways to a real change in the world .
what they learned in the mosque , it kept it to join the IS .
this was an insight , as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia concerned me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fri@@ ghtened every day on our democracy , to our freedom of mind ?
a study -- actually showing several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ ence studies -- if we fear , pass at least three things .
we rather accept a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you have reported test persons messages which had been reported negative over Muslims , they have more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look at the mood for Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in the ap@@ ron of Iraq war and during two periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manip@@ ulate the public to compens@@ ate the foundation of a free society , reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear will harm us all .
with the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was very talented at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the most sweet , generous person who knew her .
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did you become such a se@@ cul@@ ated young man from my Bru@@ der@@ lein ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne in her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had arrived in the afternoon after he had posted external on his fac@@ tions to Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism cannot be only imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we chose the Mos@@ que .
with our son in Kinder@@ garten , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and with@@ drew my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am became an announcement , than@@ ked and named our guests , for the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ credit@@ ors who came , not to attack us , but to join us .
at that moment I collapsed .
these people were there , because they had courage and compassion for panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join them that think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say that you might say that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk to work a bra@@ int@@ ner with deep @-@ speed , such an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
looking forward to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the biggest ever carried out study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family they want work , and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any regard .
if people seem to appear as a rule , then the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to become a billion @-@ billion business .
monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ yers . it is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before serving air packages in our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting flights , high speed and acceleration can be achieved in a close space .
they can also build up sel@@ ectable structures .
they have learned to carry bur@@ dens to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and to respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible limits in the autonomous flight .
in order to work autonom@@ ously , it must know collective , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new location technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , calculations on board , what the machine should do .
external commands are available on top of the same . e.g. , &quot; Start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail@@ starter ,
a pilot that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
as other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flying , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear tail@@ ors is that they react sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aviation doesn &apos;t matter in whatever position to reg@@ ain the optimum position and improve performance by practic@@ ing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often introduce basic abstract questions that inv@@ ade the core of the cause .
one such question would be : what is the p@@ etty @-@ possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this , who want to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter is known as machines with a thousand mov@@ able parts that accum@@ ulate to viol@@ ate you .
several decades ago , trained pilots could fly remot@@ ely controlled flight devices that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only a mobile part , a prop@@ eller ,
no folders , hing@@ es and cross @-@ cut edges , no further pitch drives or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inside live very much , so that it can fly stable , and can move in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability , it is right to throw it right if all , is small , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video which was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ric .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
thereby he receives the au@@ dition ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is available in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us see this .
if flying machines are to be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ ellers .
it turns on clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something is wrong , a motor or prop@@ eller fails to fly electronic or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly .
we will demonstrate that , by making half a plane .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows an aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where the room is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , encourage these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas .
there is a flying lamp@@ shade hanging on Broadway like over @-@ back machine .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us the salary in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures that form them in so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a massive industrial and economic potential , is the t@@ ittle on the i .
thank you very much .
at 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far away galaxy have two black holes against each other faster , they turned into pure energy in a t@@ enth@@ s of pure energy .
for this short moment , they lighten@@ ed bright as all the stars in all the galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
they did not put your energy in the form of light --
finally , we are talking about black holes .
the entire energy was given in space @-@ time storage and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events temporarily .
1.3 billion years ago was just a multi @-@ cell life on earth .
since then the earth has brought a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , ra@@ rs , men and -- God arise with -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially cour@@ age@@ ous -- Ra@@ i Weiss was decided by the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts , which arise from col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy gen@@ ius so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry gra@@ vit@@ ational ob@@ servatory .
in the subsequent time the precision of Lig@@ o was able to increase considerably , which greatly improved the output power .
therefore we call him Advanced Lig@@ o now .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o started to solve some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colored black holes passed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Birth of my daughter
and the leave of my to@@ d@@ ill father .
basically , the fruits of my life were .
all that I worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist from black holes and their by ob@@ serv@@ atories like Lig@@ o . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gravity shaft is a cr@@ us@@ ement in the feet of space and time .
by passing the shaft , the room and its total contents are stretched in one direction and the other is stri@@ ped .
to illustrate the lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity often a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stret@@ chy and dust , stret@@ chy and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even more ridi@@ culous .
on 14 September , for example , each one of us stretched out the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . this means that the Lig@@ o staff had lain for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer long laser detector , and that is already absurd , it would have to be measured in less than an exchange of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s cre@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text above Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , hunting after the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties while building such det@@ ectors are tremendous .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are fin@@ anci@@ ally and with the support of the public , certainly all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott says that Lig@@ o is more than an eye for more than one eye .
I would like to explain what that means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite practical . for so you can produce an image or map of things by making it coming from several points the light around you .
but it is different with sounds .
audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that give you a lot :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ ru@@ pts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
with them we can not make any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by watching changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audible range .
so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can literally hear the universe .
the gravity to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , where my colleague Scott has long been busy .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , one hears the same cir@@ cu@@ le with an additional sound change . that sounds like that : W@@ u wu wu wu wu !
it is a kind of motion pictures , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; No one knows what he has to hear , det@@ ects this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 times sun mass , which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let us think about what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 eyes , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine that forces .
fantastic .
and we know , because we have heard it .
therein is the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to exploring the universe as it never was possible .
on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the un@@ seen .
much in space we can -- practical or basically -- not to see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ tr@@ ons explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them .
the thrilling physical processes happen in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through , since this op@@ ak are .
gravity waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would never be happy to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the urine is obsc@@ ured by his own im@@ itation .
using gravity shafts , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and probably the most important : I am optimistic that we have never seen in all the things we have never seen , and of whom we have never seen . things that we can only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found the first attempt that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says about this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak to our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o enables us to focus on the events of the All , on the creation of the stars and ultimately on how we proce@@ eded out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now exists , as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and l@@ ur@@ king the sound of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a whole new generation of ob@@ serv@@ atories on earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the jungle ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tested an experiment .
for a year I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I feared that I was afraid .
no matter whether it made me nervous , brought me to unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing with ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just to do that thing I feared , removed my fear .
my fear , speech@@ es to keep my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a specific yes that changed my life deeply , to a un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all &quot; swe@@ ets of in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot;
as if it were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; swe@@ ats , I need milk for my be@@ ak up . &quot;
she once wondered if I could play with her when I was right on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
of a new life setting in my family . from then on I sw@@ elled to play with them whenever you are doing so , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am trying very much .
it has a magic effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also got a start@@ ling side effect : only recently , I understood that &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things up , get down to life .
dream job .
no , no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I generate television .
I &apos;m doing television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for taking out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each stream has hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days of four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three shows , which simultaneously are in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how to get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows run on Thursday evening .
around the world my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really st@@ ille , creative time to tell my fans around the camp@@ fires and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all silence -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am in working in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it is when I put forces on canvas as a painting I painted on canvas .
so as you dream a high sound , just like a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , st@@ ress@@ ful and depri@@ ved , funny and irrit@@ ating , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and sensible , and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a sum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could drive on it forever .
many people take it when I explain to them the sum@@ s that I am talking about writing that writing is joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , this does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began working with television production , when I began to work and work , build up , create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you may not strive for size .
the feeling is not different to strive , regardless of size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is called gen@@ ius .
maybe it is ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it in question .
to make a clear note : the more things I get ever more episodes , the more work there , the more things at the same time , the more I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love working , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ laid , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burned down .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that their mom@@ my is a single employer .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom@@ my will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; swe@@ ats , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was out of charge .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as usual : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked out weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , not deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not exist , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me , silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ to @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so what do you do if what one does , the work you love , suddenly fade ?
I know some may think : &quot; loc@@ ust@@ l you , dum@@ b of the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know , you &apos;re doing it , you are working , you love to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker who knows what you feel like the sum@@ s , and knows how the sum@@ s already knew if the sum@@ s stops when the sum@@ s stops , who then is it ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; ask me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things are aware of :
first , I must say Yes to everything and second , she called me not &quot; swe@@ ats . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; swe@@ ats . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I am titanium and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
and so they say , &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special about that .
we play and her sisters to@@ ast , we laugh a lot and I &apos;m reading quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in the sol@@ itude and in the absence of Sum@@ mens , I can &apos;t do anything unless you fit .
I am focused .
I &apos;m silent .
the country that I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists is st@@ icky finger and mo@@ ist k@@ is@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it goes to slo@@ gan@@ s , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Eis@@ Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and a burst of energy comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audible , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel as though I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium dioxide , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I am telling you by using shows and TV hours and how functioning my brain , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is not strength and it is not labor specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum@@ s is Self @-@ consciousness and Peace .
real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are to be experiencing problems , expectations and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered like the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt .
it is a law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s back .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not ans@@ at@@ zwe@@ ise so , how to work .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like playing .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer at the workplace as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , for what a human being do rather than to be home ?
well , I think .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed , none of them .
we shave in the garden , before and back , round and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
so I feel mostly st@@ iff , absent and confused .
I will always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask : why did we ever listen to the games ?
you can also say it ! do they always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you stop me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are quite right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they think they want something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie will replace me .
and speaking my teen @-@ daughter for about 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , it does not need to need more .
everyone can catch up for 15 minutes , even on a bad mood !
15 minutes in a slice !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to stay .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my friends , my world . there must not be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul of peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; games &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I stay . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything that I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education , when I wanted to out@@ pace myself more and more .
15 minutes on the way , why not allow to treat for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s back in my spare time . sum@@ s appears to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens in and I find myself back in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . it for@@ ts me to new ideas . I use it in full trains and I love my work .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
bubble and st@@ icky finger , dinner with friends .
now this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful .
it is me schn@@ u@@ ppe that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and for more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I run , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the towers , the sum@@ s , the other , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more it makes this unusual , gru@@ elling , naked and new feeling of living in me . less players -- more I !
the more I feel these sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I aw@@ aken you to life .
that is a job , that means living his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ am@@ ical .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to be less work and more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how to change your life from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after an automobile accident .
for us Neuro@@ surgeon is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low skill for self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was a functional neuro@@ surgical procedure .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor that tries to improve the nerve function by different surgical measures .
surely they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; Tie@@ cone hir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; there is one electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function has improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease that suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with something help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Consult@@ ant and worked in the emergency room day and night .
I often provided patients with brain trau@@ ma trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ h s@@ lows down the brain and increases the skull pressure .
to save lives , you have to reduce the skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a portion of the s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist .
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not easy task .
being able to grow from a tissue in tissue , comparable to small children who are out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to prosp@@ er .
we had to do exactly that with these cells .
after many attempts , it managed Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a common cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , irregular cells .
perhaps you know still out of the biological class that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into any cell type of the body .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they divided slowly and after a couple of weeks , they died even .
we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called hot Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large @-@ cer@@ eb@@ rin@@ ds cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the development of the brain .
but why stay they get ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near bra@@ ins .
this is not so certain .
however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows bra@@ ins .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ lingu@@ istic field , and then cultiv@@ ate the cells as it did as Jean @-@ François
and then mark them in color to track them in the brain .
in the last step we were planning it to the close of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we make these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we have the same cells in damaged bra@@ ins ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we kept the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely taken back after a few weeks , they go back home . the room is already taken , they will not disappear there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a violation and in@@ sist@@ ent exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , which were not as planned .
the evidence that they show is these small points . these are the cells we have in vitro in the culture .
we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual si@@ p task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they had reached a stable net level , we spent the motor@@ sport area in the motor Cort@@ ex .
then the ap@@ es were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen with people , they recover spont@@ ane@@ ously up to some degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at some degree , just as the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left hand , they see the monkeys that recover spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from inf@@ rin@@ gement .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
now , seeing the cells were in@@ hib@@ ited : the same monkey , two months after graduation .
I can tell you , that was very exciting for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later use them .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can need it . &quot;
in any case , I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these amazing results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the clinical study approval .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to make the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the west make a great mistake , to look at it as a matter of course .
we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable abstra@@ ction .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not correct .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ers in Beijing have demonstrated that it is absolutely possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while the politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is overcome with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government - that the democratic process of our country -- was un@@ mistak@@ able , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not change the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who would repeatedly believe that democracy would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I be@@ g you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy , our societies become dro@@ pping , our future is w@@ asted and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction that at present our econom@@ ies are threatened .
I call it the &quot; twin ran@@ ates par@@ adox . &quot;
one top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the school ,
but only a few recognize his dy@@ mus .
a mountain of unused cash , which is too anxi@@ ous to invest it , however , where it would be productive , where it could produce productive and also all the things that humanity is urg@@ ently needed , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the US , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 tr@@ illion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on .
3.4 tr@@ illion U.S. dollars will sound like a lot of money until it compar@@ es with 5.1 tr@@ illion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , except the stock ex@@ changes and the real estate prices are lifted up .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin ran@@ ates , which do not compens@@ ate through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds of the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , which could not invest in which they could not invest in which they could not invest in which his son would kill him if he will grow ,
un@@ w@@ illed circumstances , that leads , that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him .
this is my Ha@@ ze with capitalism --
his completely lav@@ ish article All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and particularly all of the technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth .
so democracy is the solution ?
but I believe . but before we proceed : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally ended up too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , there would be an error to minim@@ ise the position of ath@@ letic democracy due to these expres@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle , which lights very bright , it is also quickly burned down .
however , our present @-@ day liberal democracy did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ letic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for mist@@ ress .
the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process has been invaded by politics as the economy -- so the world of corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ cra@@ cies @-@ free zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies there are since that time began , in which this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two and the economy gradually s@@ hi@@ ked the policy .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians do not work anymore like before ?
it is not due to de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is because nowadays you can be in the government and yet not in power , because the power of politics is wander@@ ed in the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ em@@ ing with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a flock of prey that is so sustainable the animals they are nour@@ ished , so that they are star@@ ved at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that increases the policy so far so far . the power of corpor@@ ations is growing , political goods are growing , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are too fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their corpor@@ ations .
the more successful of capitalism distri@@ butes &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin ran@@ ates , and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ tire politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and aliens .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin ran@@ ates higher , the waste disposal , and the social conflicts deep , as it seems very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievement that he has brought forth is to survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something that the society must serve the human beings and put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; novel utop@@ ia instead of having &quot; Matrix &quot; like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I want to tell you some examples in the near future .
in the company &apos;s area : please introduce a capital market , where you will earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income came from capital and income , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no do@@ cking between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and dro@@ ves , and ultimately no emp@@ t@@ ying tw@@ ins .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies have a freely fluctu@@ ating rate of exchange , in a universal , global , digital currency that will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 biggest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; &apos; -- and each government is paying the sum , which corresponds to the trade deficit or commercial excess of the country in a joint venture .
imagine that these funds are invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment resources are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world , which I describe you , is the same in whom she pre@@ fers privileged individuals and mar@@ x@@ istic because they buried the separation of capital and labour in tr@@ ash@@ can history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can introduce a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we fall into a &quot; matrix &quot; - a similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to work politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your own biography itself as liber@@ ate Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and business is ... Do we do not do this , technological development will create a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term stag@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ l , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : that &apos;s a very Greek , a sort of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday with the dinners of the Red@@ ner you have very clearly said what you have seen from the view of the West to China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracy we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy in politics , while the area where most of the economy -- a completely demo@@ cra@@ cies @-@ free zone .
in a certain way , when I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to China today to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to associate liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill ,
he was especially scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what you can see in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now , to act , to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , huge to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about their experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity to decide on the basis of Greek demonstrations -- by the way , the first proposal which revealed this den@@ ial --
we do it right . unfortunately , the powers have chosen to deny the euro@@ zone within the euro area .
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system , which is not vi@@ able to get pass@@ able by political will and Author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it may have gone out for a while , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future , if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a Minister for Finance , or any minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in an analog@@ ous situation , he claims that he did not make any mistakes , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the credit@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the au@@ ditions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit they have been a cat@@ astro@@ phic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the funds raised by the Tro@@ ika , which has imposed on us this policy , &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ ano@@ inting mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive actions of the convers@@ ations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone did not survive .
for if they don &apos;t survive , they will be demon@@ ized and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astro@@ phic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we introduce ourselves to the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be acceptable for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope very much that you are wrong in that point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard of Roy Price , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 mid @-@ 25 minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that met Roy just three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; Movies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
he has to find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows which are located right on this corner .
this curve is the valu@@ ation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the valu@@ ation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that ad@@ di@@ cted to a s@@ quad@@ ron , your brain asks , &quot; Where is it more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- it should tell you enough what is going on that end .
Roy Price does not look at the left side of the curve , for I think you need some particular intelligence to under@@ offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium pul@@ l@@ ul@@ ence , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire them .
so he must make sure he is really at the right side .
the print is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something so it doesn &apos;t want to risk Roy Price .
he wants to create successes .
he takes a guaranteed success , so he will hold off a contest .
he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and selected by a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online , where anyone can watch it for free .
and if Amazon returns for free things , you get there right ?
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are watched by watching this shows .
you are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you record when you start the show , when you start p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts are ski@@ pped or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process this and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four rep@@ ubli@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many may remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always looking for this a super @-@ show and he uses data for it but he does something different .
instead of a competition , he and his team have watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x @-@ viewer , so the reviews that they give shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these small details about the viewers : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had together all the parts , they entered a car and decided to do not a Sit@@ com on four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data sealed firms .
they connect these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic seems somehow that it should work with everything .
when you get millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years for statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by a very powerful computer .
the worst thing you can expect is good TV , right ?
if data analysis does not work so this is sc@@ ary because we live in a time , in which we take more and more , to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is prob@@ able that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a release is carried out or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results produced . that &apos;s not the fact that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data are even wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can fore@@ see through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , worse kind , by data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news item . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly doesn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it didn &apos;t work , it was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed firms such as Amazon and Google are sometimes mis@@ understood .
despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in law , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able people to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer treatment
or the development of a medication . over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
you need to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things :
first , make this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second you put together the individual parts to touch a decision .
sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important facts : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help cut a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the pieces and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this . we have it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete to touch a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they belong to the process .
they use data to understand their audience better what else they would not have been capable of , but the decision was to put together all those parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that didn &apos;t stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant it was a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they turned TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they could ever say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
this did not lead to the desired outcome .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how power@@ fully they are , data is just a tool , and not to forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , it was the machine for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question , you only have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will later become a technology demo later .
I have met some decisions in my life so far , where I should have heard in the ball .
however , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through something much more cl@@ oned , like data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
this way , perhaps the ball will wis@@ er and wis@@ er . finally , it is about us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encouraging news that in spite of the great amount of data is still paying out , making decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks to go .
for the end is not the data , but the risks associated with which you end at the right end .
thank you beautiful .
