<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that NSA illegally heard telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter, that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this case, he describes a catastrophic US secret operation in which the CIA was literally handed out to Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know who did not like the chapter like that?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government was determined against Risen and called it to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of government, Whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mute they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government came with Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter had already done before him, he refused and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had years stated that it would be indispensable for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: during the time of electronic monitoring, the Reporter and springs can hide and hide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and smash to assert, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, his phone wise is concerned,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit information, and even travel documents with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, Justice has more condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how it can be a problem, especially because the government is home to much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result that a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the media work on the game that is supposed to be protected by the first constitutionaries, because the government has more possibilities to spying all of them.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allowed to deal with reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they can contact us from the moment in which they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not yet been written as Risen has written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet iconic, which was developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to an news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload or send documents, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency access has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot take more information secretly, and many of the information they would like would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole, to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that all endanger ourselves.</seg>

<seg id="39">Who wants to report about abuses in the supply of soldiers humd and overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for the contaminated drinking water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">These technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leck of the story was published.] [what does it mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness in order to make an explanation.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness by a statement.] This week we were looking for news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's resident firm - Moselle Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Moselle Fonseca and say, "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see e-mails, sharing of messages like the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad suffers for tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead on a close friend of children days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait annoying to the next release, and to the next disclosed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">It sounds like the Plot of a agency name or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for major public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used to hide and conceal their assets -- something that we will discuss and reveal their assets for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how this tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always put it like a matryodapuppe in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who behind these brothers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have been no more prominent Americans having occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no wealthy Americans to hide their assets in control.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which this tax havens work, Moselle Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states, less information needs to give less information to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts allowed to wipe schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has authorized to wipe especially anodious jib.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an uncovered investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself an African minister, who wanted to bring money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that everyone could make suggestions for a lawyer, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all prejudices. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was handed over to the money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who undertook suggestions for our covered investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It does not go to a single top polarity, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">To cope with this, we have to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior complain.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound great, as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if it will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen demonstrations at more transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">Political attention was conducted by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU covers in central registers on the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US has lagging behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties involved a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this is not the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are furious when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy, which arise and say, "Intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians to realise the problem and to do it by law this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally stop the intransparency, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design study, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a roadtrip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace team.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land on the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me saying, "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Ask, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stayed at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get in?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I was such a fear I got out of the bed, tighten to toe, and shut up my sleeping door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as hosts. it has changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreign lands, are actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Back people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate draws off and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think that creativity can make it be afraid to turn into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have thought about how we could earn something. our apartment will stay in a designer bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at the air floor for 20 dollars on the air floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese ham Omelet was completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door went into the castle, I starred Brian and me.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to the investors: "we want to create a website, on the people publicly available pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite the foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is yet completely in comfort would invest in a store which allows strangers to sleep in apartments other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children have learnt all that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you get on the things you can see. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We have learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immensely confidence that had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degrees we trust in.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked cell phone your left sitting roommates.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent adventure of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is still personal when your mobile phone is, is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell of a stranger in my hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This makes most of the guests feel free if they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just once, who now has Al Gores phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he may serve as President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have imagined first with his name, if he would have told whence he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you could have 150 judges who say: "he can really hold very well-locked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their reservations before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week, we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are similar to the age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most like us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is a natural social prejudicive.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have fewer than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of common similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you can get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions on the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you are telling too little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tells us too much, as for example: "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- if the request is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, e. g "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I'm happy with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design, to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the correct quantity text. we also give tips on which themes you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">Which we hadn't reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than prepared to leave these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people are taking our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that has not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">I worked in customer service at the beginning of the project. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front door when confidence has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than that calls. it's hurt when I'm just thinking about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which is heard in the voice of the caller, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, from the 123 million nights only a fraction was one problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other to justify each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, there can be miraculous.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, who are subject to sitting activities on heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are true guardian, who can save one's life, although they know not at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car at the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay longer and stay longer without charging the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay run off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trading here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it just doesn't just call "rental industry," the thing is not just.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trading that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you are traveling to fast food nowadays, it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if you were interested in every place one would have visited, a group there would have been waiting to be a thorough approach and show one in a pub tour of which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from the reason?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I introduce cities, which allow ourselves to society and relationships, instead of solitude and amination.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in the South Korean capital of Seoul. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Are now offered residents. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were trained to people whose children were moved. there were incubators for incubation.</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, over our platform today, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be host to a stranger or themselves.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites for us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the ingredients of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome more deep prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it startling,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it whenever a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I ask myself what we can use design for soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a horticist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the fault for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media form people, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met one Muslims: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee house -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagegra-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practising, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sang, because, baby, I was not born this way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have chosen this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to oughten me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual human being, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to bear the hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you oppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and compared to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have to do with the basket.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought in question, doubted and believed in the end.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion, deepened with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik will sometimes bring me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt the feeling you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">I later married and began as all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the Egyptian American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had been folded to the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "Breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into anger.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "... in the name of Islam..."... "..." "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only my country has been attacked but in the Nu converted me to the deeds of others from a citizen in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin building studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how to spur me -- as we silently drove -- as deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said: "be vigilant," "Be watchful," "Stay in well lit areas," "assemble you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">Again, the warnings: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were with Muslims who were torn apart and killed.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandan on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country, have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain themselves continually.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have no questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people: "there is a problem in that country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Is it just the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and benign tumor only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, not tumour in the body of the US, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Aesthetic and Olympionics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people other beliefs tolerant, and major citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">As a leader of the police in Washington, DC recently told me, people are actually not radialised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radialized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Radicalization process, one has noticed that it starts online. the person believes that the person is believed to do a brainous group, that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS founds their brutality with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, as a mother, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination, if one recognizes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you have a look at them, she does not drive on what they were blown in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality which they read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a recently amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she could have joined the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, brought them to silence, and told her that their wrath, their sense of injustice in the world, would bring them into difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by anything and something that could make sense of their anger, it was an main goal for the instrumentalization through extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam gave the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse her for their anger, he showed their constructive ways to a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque, it kept it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, as the Islamophobia concerned me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of frightened every day on our democracy, to our freedom of mind?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually showing several neuroscience studies -- if we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you have reported test persons messages which had been reported negative over Muslims, they have more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at the mood for Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of Iraq war and during two periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to compensate the foundation of a free society, reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear will harm us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was very talented at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the most sweet, generous person who knew her.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did you become such a seculated young man from my Bruderlein?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had arrived in the afternoon after he had posted external on his factions to Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot be only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>

<seg id="382">We chose the Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in Kindergarten, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and withdrew my shoes, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam became an announcement, thanked and named our guests, for the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-creditors who came, not to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join them that think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you might say that you are a TEDTalk to work a braintner with deep-speed, such an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">Looking forward to Muslims around the world, and I did that with the biggest ever carried out study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family they want work, and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in any regard.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people seem to appear as a rule, then the rule is usually broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists, is about to become a billion-billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial dryers. it is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before serving air packages in our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre-high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flights, high speed and acceleration can be achieved in a close space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build up selectable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry burdens to deal with turmoil and to respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible limits in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to work autonomously, it must know collective, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new location technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, calculations on board, what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on top of the same. e.g., "Start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tailstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A pilot that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">As other starters, it is efficient in advance flying, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear tailors is that they react sensitive to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aviation doesn't matter in whatever position to regain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often introduce basic abstract questions that invade the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the petty-possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this, who want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter is known as machines with a thousand movable parts that accumulate to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Several decades ago, trained pilots could fly remotely controlled flight devices that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a mobile part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No folders, hinges and cross-cut edges, no further pitch drives or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inside live very much, so that it can fly stable, and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability, it is right to throw it right if all, is small, therefore I'll show you a video which was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the audition ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated or even rotated as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is available in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see this.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines are to be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">It turns on clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something is wrong, a motor or propeller fails to fly electronic or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that, by making half a plane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows an aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and fit them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where the room is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, encourage these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">There is a flying lampshade hanging on Broadway like over-back machine.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the salary in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures that form them in so spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive industrial and economic potential, is the tittle on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">At 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far away galaxy have two black holes against each other faster, they turned into pure energy in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lightened bright as all the stars in all the galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">They did not put your energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally, we are talking about black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given in space-time storage and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago was just a multi-cell life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought a lot: corals, fish, plants, rars, men and -- God arise with -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss was decided by the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech to search for gravitational shafts, which arise from colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy genius so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometry gravitational observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the subsequent time the precision of Ligo was able to increase considerably, which greatly improved the output power.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we call him Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo started to solve some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colored black holes passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the leave of my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruits of my life were.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist from black holes and their by observatories like Ligo. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravity shaft is a crusement in the feet of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">By passing the shaft, the room and its total contents are stretched in one direction and the other is striped.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate the lecturers in courses for the theory of relativity often a really albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretchy and dust, stretchy and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even more ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each one of us stretched out the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. this means that the Ligo staff had lain for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer long laser detector, and that is already absurd, it would have to be measured in less than an exchange of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's creotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text above Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunting after the waves: "the technical difficulties while building such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are financially and with the support of the public, certainly all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott says that Ligo is more than an eye for more than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for so you can produce an image or map of things by making it coming from several points the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">But it is different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that give you a lot:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties like pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we can not make any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by watching changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, where my colleague Scott has long been busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, one hears the same circule with an additional sound change. that sounds like that: Wu wu wu wu wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion pictures, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard the following: [Surrender of the sound] No one knows what he has to hear, detects this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30 times sun mass, which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 eyes, the other with a mass of 36 probes, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine that forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know, because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein is the lasting importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to exploring the universe as it never was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path, we can listen to the universe and hear the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practical or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why mtrons explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them.</seg>
<seg id="538">The thrilling physical processes happen in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, since this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravity waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would never be happy to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, since the urine is obscured by his own imitation.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravity shafts, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably the most important: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all the things we have never seen, and of whom we have never seen. things that we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found the first attempt that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says about this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, as Ligo observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak to our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo enables us to focus on the events of the All, on the creation of the stars and ultimately on how we proceeded out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists, as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and lurking the sound of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the jungle?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tested an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For a year I would say to everything "Yes!" I feared that I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it made me nervous, brought me to unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just to do that thing I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a specific yes that changed my life deeply, to a unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls all "sweets of inexplicable reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if it were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"sweats, I need milk for my beak up."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once wondered if I could play with her when I was right on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">Of a new life setting in my family. from then on I swelled to play with them whenever you are doing so, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am trying very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also got a startling side effect: only recently, I understood that "" Yes "" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things up, get down to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No, no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I generate television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for taking out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each stream has hundreds of jobs, which did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days of four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three shows, which simultaneously are in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how to get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV shows run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really stille, creative time to tell my fans around the campfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am in working in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I put forces on canvas as a painting I painted on canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as you dream a high sound, just like a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, stressful and deprived, funny and irritating, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible, and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A summing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could drive on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take it when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing is joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, this does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began working with television production, when I began to work and work, build up, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you may not strive for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling is not different to strive, regardless of size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear note: the more things I get ever more episodes, the more work there, the more things at the same time, the more I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overlaid, exaggerated, burned down.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mommy is a single employer.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mommy will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "sweats, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was out of charge.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as usual: the same Titanen work, 15 hours-day, worked out weekends, no remorse, not delegate, a titanium does not exist, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me, silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-to-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what one does, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know some may think: "locustl you, dumb of the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you're doing it, you are working, you love to be a teacher, a banker who knows what you feel like the sums, and knows how the sums already knew if the sums stops when the sums stops, who then is it?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" ask me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to everything and second, she called me not "sweats."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "sweats."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am titanium and my sums, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so they say, "Mama, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters toast, we laugh a lot and I'm reading quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in the solitude and in the absence of Summens, I can't do anything unless you fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country that I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists is sticky finger and moist kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it goes to slogans, or whatever the girl in "The EisQueen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and a burst of energy comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as though I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I am telling you by using shows and TV hours and how functioning my brain, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not strength and it is not labor specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is Self-consciousness and Peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real sums ignores the pressure of history, which are to be experiencing problems, expectations and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered like the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums back.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not ansatzweise so, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, for what a human being do rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I think.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We shave in the garden, before and back, round and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">So I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I will always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you live, and the sums of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why did we ever listen to the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! do they always say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you stop me for naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are quite right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they think they want something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a ladybug or cookie will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speaking my teen-daughter for about 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, it does not need to need more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can catch up for 15 minutes, even on a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes in a slice!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to stay.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my friends, my world. there must not be the children. it is to feel the sums to have a place for his soul of peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I stay. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything that I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education, when I wanted to outpace myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the way, why not allow to treat for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums back in my spare time. sums appears to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens in and I find myself back in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. it forts me to new ideas. I use it in full trains and I love my work.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubble and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now this is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me schnuppe that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and for more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I run, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the towers, the sums, the other, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more it makes this unusual, gruelling, naked and new feeling of living in me. less players -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel these sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things out, I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That is a job, that means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreamical.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to be less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgeon is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low skill for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was a functional neurosurgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor that tries to improve the nerve function by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the most famous, the "Tiecone hirnstimulation." there is one electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function has improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Consultant and worked in the emergency room day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with brain trauma trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that brain-brain traumath slows down the brain and increases the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, you have to reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a portion of the swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Being able to grow from a tissue in tissue, comparable to small children who are out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">We had to do exactly that with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, it managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a common cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, irregular cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know still out of the biological class that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into any cell type of the body.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a couple of weeks, they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large-cerebrinds cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the development of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they get?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brains.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brains.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass out of the non-linguistic field, and then cultivate the cells as it did as Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we were planning it to the close of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotrantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we make these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we have the same cells in damaged brains?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we kept the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely taken back after a few weeks, they go back home. the room is already taken, they will not disappear there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a violation and insistent exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, which were not as planned.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show is these small points. these are the cells we have in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual sip task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable net level, we spent the motorsport area in the motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the apes were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they recover spontaneously up to some degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at some degree, just as the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand, they see the monkeys that recover spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from infringement.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, seeing the cells were inhibited: the same monkey, two months after graduation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, that was very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know somebody who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">In any case, I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these amazing results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the clinical study approval.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to make the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the west make a great mistake, to look at it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable abstraction.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not correct.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imiters in Beijing have demonstrated that it is absolutely possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while the politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is overcome with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government - that the democratic process of our country -- was unmistakable, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not change the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who would repeatedly believe that democracy would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beg you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies become dropping, our future is wasted and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction that at present our economies are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin ranates paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the Schuldenberg, who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the school,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is too anxious to invest it, however, where it would be productive, where it could produce productive and also all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the US, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars will sound like a lot of money until it compares with 5.1 trillion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices are lifted up.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin ranates, which do not compensate through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds of the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, which could not invest in which they could not invest in which they could not invest in which his son would kill him if he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwilled circumstances, that leads, that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Haze with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His completely lavish article All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and particularly all of the technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But I believe. but before we proceed: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally ended up too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, there would be an error to minimise the position of athletic democracy due to these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which lights very bright, it is also quickly burned down.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-day liberal democracy did not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athletic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for mistress.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process has been invaded by politics as the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracies-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies there are since that time began, in which this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two and the economy gradually shiked the policy.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians do not work anymore like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays you can be in the government and yet not in power, because the power of politics is wandered in the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haeming with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a flock of prey that is so sustainable the animals they are nourished, so that they are starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that increases the policy so far so far. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are growing, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their corporations.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism distributes "Demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin ranates, and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to retire politics and economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and aliens.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin ranates higher, the waste disposal, and the social conflicts deep, as it seems very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievement that he has brought forth is to survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or something that the society must serve the human beings and put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" novel utopia instead of having "Matrix" like Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I want to tell you some examples in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company's area: please introduce a capital market, where you will earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income came from capital and income, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no docking between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and droves, and ultimately no emptying twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies have a freely fluctuating rate of exchange, in a universal, global, digital currency that will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 biggest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" '-- and each government is paying the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or commercial excess of the country in a joint venture.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that these funds are invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment resources are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I describe you, is the same in whom she prefers privileged individuals and marxistic because they buried the separation of capital and labour in trashcan history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can introduce a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fall into a "matrix" - a similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to work politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your own biography itself as liberate Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and business is... Do we do not do this, technological development will create a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers as "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, this is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirl, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: that's a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein, who said. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday with the dinners of the Redner you have very clearly said what you have seen from the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracy we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy in politics, while the area where most of the economy -- a completely democracies-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, when I may say so provocative, China is similar to China today to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill,</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can see in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now, to act, to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century, huge to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to decide on the basis of Greek demonstrations -- by the way, the first proposal which revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">We do it right. unfortunately, the powers have chosen to deny the eurozone within the euro area.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system, which is not viable to get passable by political will and Authoritarianism, it may have gone out for a while, but if the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future, if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister for Finance, or any minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in an analogous situation, he claims that he did not make any mistakes, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the creditors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the auditions that ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the funds raised by the Troika, which has imposed on us this policy, "that was a colosanointing mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive actions of the conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they don't survive, they will be demonized and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we introduce ourselves to the way of a postmodern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be acceptable for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope very much that you are wrong in that point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard of Roy Price, although it is likely to be responsible for 22 mid-25 minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that met Roy just three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes herself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows which are located right on this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the valuation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that addicted to a squadron, your brain asks, "Where is it more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- it should tell you enough what is going on that end.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not look at the left side of the curve, for I think you need some particular intelligence to underoffer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium pullulence, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really at the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something so it doesn't want to risk Roy Price.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He takes a guaranteed success, so he will hold off a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes lots of ideas for TV shows and selected by a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online, where anyone can watch it for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon returns for free things, you get there right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watched by watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you start paused, which parts are skipped or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process this and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom on four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many may remember this show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time with another company another manager has placed a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy is always looking for this a super-show and he uses data for it but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team have watched the existing data on the Netflix-viewer, so the reviews that they give shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these small details about the viewers: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they entered a car and decided to do not a Sitcom on four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data sealed firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic seems somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you get millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years for statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The worst thing you can expect is good TV, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so this is scary because we live in a time, in which we take more and more, to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the US and for dismissal, it is probable that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a release is carried out or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. that's not the fact that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data are even wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can foresee through data analysis outbreaks of flu, worse kind, by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news item. the success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year, until it suddenly doesn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It didn't work, it was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed firms such as Amazon and Google are sometimes misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable people to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">You need to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, make this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the individual parts; as a second you put together the individual parts to touch a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important facts: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help cut a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the pieces and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this. we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to put together again, even if the information is incomplete to touch a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience better what else they would not have been capable of, but the decision was to put together all those parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" that didn't stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant it was a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they turned TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could ever say: "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">This did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerfully they are, data is just a tool, and not to forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, it was the machine for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question, you only have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later become a technology demo later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life so far, where I should have heard in the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">However, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through something much more cloned, like data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">This way, perhaps the ball will wiser and wiser. finally, it is about us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging news that in spite of the great amount of data is still paying out, making decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks to go.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For the end is not the data, but the risks associated with which you end at the right end.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
