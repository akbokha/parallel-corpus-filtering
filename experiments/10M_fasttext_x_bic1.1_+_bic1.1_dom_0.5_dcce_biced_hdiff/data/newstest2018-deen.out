Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people should meet .
a tomb , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers generate the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not current .
everyone knows it , who had to be exciting , because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i had to show a green meadow instead of a wal@@ k@@ way .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ tor@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort Bavaria of the State government , are everything else but currently very illumin@@ ating .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it is clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the Digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a spl@@ attered carpet , which you can see as such .
the large coverage map were detailed maps , so @-@ called urine leaves for cities and municip@@ alities .
according to the Bay@@ er@@ mination administration , this originated in 18@@ 10 and 1864 the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if French troops ended with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 1801 , there were today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bayern card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ical Bureau &quot; established the project and thus established the Bay@@ erische Engagement Ring .
the extension sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and is to be found like any other on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison of Early / Today is most impressive .
the city has expanded and expanded in all directions .
one example is the send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
after 21 years after the map , S@@ end@@ ling was created in 1877 , in the Munich area of Munich .
today , the send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ du@@ sts focus in 1856 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the west park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : there appears a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written documents from the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ mal release &quot; from which the basic tax was derived from .
little plots finish there today no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Lower send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the prehistoric sheet , it is read in the area of today &apos;s au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , &quot; on the guest house &quot; at the air &quot; or even in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ burg district &quot; emerged on the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot;
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed the establishment - of the psychiat@@ rist who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; it was advanced for his time and ended the inc@@ eption of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
he is also forbidden to use the staff to make violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
there was first room for 280 patients , and later it was extended to 500 places .
sometime , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ky Institute in 1905 .
since 2006 , Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry .
on the premises of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people now meet in Mun@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted him to a youth center with training .
the soccer field of the TS@@ V Munich Ost , East residential houses dating from the 1980s .
in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architec@@ turally based on the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ strasse , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids .
the Marien@@ platz was the first place in 1856 as the &quot; main square , &quot; which was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War was also a decisive change in the heart of Mün@@ ch .
in December 1944 , the bombs of the Allied forces seized many holes in the city centre .
a great remained until today - at Marien@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business buildings and a tomb stone from the Middle Ages were once on the Marien@@ hof , where the days work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line will be carried out .
the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the shooting gallery of today - and fill the hole on the Marien@@ hof .
civil Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of dyes found a warning for coloured people who travel due to disc@@ rimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks by the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial @-@ based inci@@ dents that occur last time in the whole country , &quot; says it in the position of the Group .
a recent approved law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to win discrimination , as well as the investig@@ ative authorities of the state who disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate the group to issue the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injuries of the civil rights , people will happen .
they are hal@@ ted because of their skin color , they will unite , or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we listen to complaints in such a frequency which we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
the group noted inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist publishers at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances beginning of the year , after having no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in custody without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i office , which is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees informed about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be prepared whether you bring che@@ ering money or relatives know they are travelling through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 H@@ ass@@ ver@@ ts in 2015 , according to the latest numbers from the FB@@ I , based on the number of such injuries on the number of such injuries on the 16th position of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to complain for employment or employment discrimination .
previously the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration authorities agreed to susp@@ end people due to immigration flows , which will contribute to the view of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent years , stak@@ eholders has implemented the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
female fence project is elementary
the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ s@@ ari@@ zed Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
representatives of the fisher@@ ies CDU @-@ town association together with Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the excav@@ ation yard of the Schwen@@ demann family .
at first , Markus Schwen@@ demann best@@ ows insights into its operation , in which he farms 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and as many young are accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows , like Schwen@@ demann .
on the table of holiday guests comes exclusively Reg@@ ular .
since he is also called the BL@@ HV @-@ chairman of the fishing village , he called &quot; elem@@ ental project as &quot; elem@@ ental . &quot;
I can &apos;t profit on such steep areas .
the green area is a lot of work , a lot of work with the engine sense .
&quot; we have been strug@@ gling with the terms and top@@ ography , &quot; says Til@@ demann .
in 2003 he took over the operation and used it without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead bio@@ operation .
for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has been recognized the importance of the feminine project and is glad about the leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
one hope that the surfaces of the land could still be drawn up for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and thinking about how they continue their farm , &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor .
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were fenced off over the course of women in 2013 .
the disclos@@ ure area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be stopped up until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euros , half of leader was promoted , a quarter contributed to the fishing village of Fis@@ bach .
thus the farmers stay in 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of Wei@@ den .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lords it does not go . &quot;
for Peter White , too : &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
the State Library of Agriculture ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state subsi@@ dy of pasture .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR generated funding sources is a pre@@ condition .
in addition , the fenced area must not be s@@ lu@@ ct@@ able ( Hang@@ ing over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation .
the application for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ aun@@ project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .
the disclos@@ ure area is 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues .
Americans appreciate these as well as any other , therefore the sor@@ rel @-@ staged down@@ fall Saddam Hussein &apos;s place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a h@@ it@@ chy dispute with Jim A@@ cost@@ a from CNN about the proposals for the dra@@ stic limitation of the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a Hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have suffered him when he had done it .
but it was on their meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ cost@@ a compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem you refer to which was added later , and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively right , but as he form@@ ulated it , doesn &apos;t really go about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not committed themselves in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Tr@@ umps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confron@@ tation : it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who tried to place their words after their death on the base , knew very well that they have accomplished a high political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American Republi@@ can , in an isolated classic image showing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a quite different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change it for a long time from the right wing .
the big scre@@ aming Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed that the Statue of Liberty was not to invite anyone but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ ative con@@ doms that the American flame would bring into the controversial world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
she shall bear the tor@@ ches of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine through the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual , Lim@@ li@@ gh is something unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus in@@ sist@@ ed to see them as they were seen by the exhaust@@ ion , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys to the Dec@@ ks of ships .
it is the true sense of seeing the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue said to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognise .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine through the way , but the hat@@ red that is their only source of power ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black gets Scottish members of the team from Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle rec@@ alls a time when only two sh@@ all@@ ets belonged to the team of Great Britain .
the power director of ath@@ letics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of world championship cru@@ ises will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
black believes that &quot; Scotland has developed something special in Scotland , &quot; and the ath@@ letics of the United Kingdom has to learn something .
&quot; we welcome it , and we will try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; Black said .
&quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British ath@@ letics Men : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the crew to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought completely natural , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , which will compete with their fifth world championships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says it &quot; incredible , &quot; that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots in the British team are .
the best total number of athletes at the World Championship were seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
in the past year , the mid @-@ hau@@ st runner Mu@@ ir leads five British and two European records .
you will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another cave that was included after a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remembered her first world championships , when the only other band was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the man capit@@ als says it &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team but in some cases also at the medals and in the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special part of the team capit@@ als to be , is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and voted for something completely special for me , &quot; added them .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on these home support and benefit that we are back to the Olympiastadion Berlin .
I will get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking of critic@@ ises on Facebook : do not be@@ ware by a public ministry , if you cannot toler@@ ate voters from voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last until the newspapers stroke him because of all , from the indoor policy to its political principles .
he ch@@ imp@@ ed with criticism , safe .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
for the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; The freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and dum@@ b , we are led to battles like sheep . &quot;
this brings me to Governor Larry H@@ ogan , who must work on it to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him about this very beginning of this week .
the govern@@ ors of the governor canc@@ eled the complaint as temporary , and the online commentary was full of a counter@@ part with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a guy like H@@ ogan .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to re@@ connect with his voters and made his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the Govern@@ ors &quot; side - which is a public forum , which is regarded as officially and will be paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Mr. Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of Tro@@ l@@ len or sp@@ amm@@ ers or water @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ ogan .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no trol@@ ls .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful , and not prof@@ ited .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
lawyer at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not cas@@ h@@ illed , but she asked to break after hate .
&quot; I am sorry that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to h@@ ass@@ ver@@ ge and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary area of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people takes on the same subject , then they are considered as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the workers of govern@@ ors have referred to as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would others probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn or demonstr@@ ators to silence and to silence .
but exactly this just happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ ogan is not the first public public , who is critic@@ ized for this purpose that he imp@@ lies Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ est@@ ones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County exp@@ ired the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the US District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she was a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable portraits had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mail letters beat on his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
the people who used P@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all the letters of newspapers who made Washington &apos;s decisions .
pet@@ itions that critic@@ ized his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping of Britain by the United States , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not put them into silence .
freedom of freedom , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true tour means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European Union No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hoping to hope for the next three days in local comfort since the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led to the Arch@@ er@@ field Links until the end of the final year before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament messenger in the name of the association &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieves its glory with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition .
Jerry made a great job when he set this place .
he is an e@@ ager supp@@ orter of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great showcase for that course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship , even though he won his 32 @-@ year career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; the player told in South@@ port .
&quot; I have not able to defend the extrem@@ ad@@ ura Open as they had won in the year after I had won them out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the action of the homeland .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you sense these additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .
I am glad how it went so far . &quot;
with the trio in the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ulty .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belongs to the six sh@@ all@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance fee is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
more people have died in the last two decades due to passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) will result in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 bi@@ ases of lung cancer is attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoking , &quot; said Master manager Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases for pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home@@ connections prove very complex
construction work in Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; reason@@ ably in time , &quot; says the head of the Fred Hein@@ ze building .
in the field of hou@@ sings , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ects , as in the underground there is much se@@ amounts , which is not noticeable in the plans .
the traffic , which has always hin@@ dered the construction , represents a big problem for the construction pp of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignorance of the drivers of red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , they do not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ troubled province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the co@@ her@@ ed Kn@@ olls with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands will be removed and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay soil - she has no furniture - where they also performs its daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of their husband , you have no fields assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too much can be dangerous : most vill@@ ain@@ ers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one vent@@ ures to get around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hochland von Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1.0@@ 26 elders had to vote in the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which touched for independence from the Dutch rule , turned back to the government of Jak@@ arta who maintains control of the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal watches .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where independent of Pap@@ ua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is boring . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo sa@@ unas , and made of corrugated iron comp@@ art@@ ments converted by rust in various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , so@@ aked journalists and practically no fore@@ ig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans promised a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and refers to her lively , handmade tur@@ ban , dark shirts , and their bright rock .
&quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a plateau of New Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars and copper .
moreover , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources worth valued at about 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military keeps the eternal presence .
a study conducted by 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 of almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands after greater autonomy threat@@ ening these golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess .
according to activists , more than 500.000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands were rap@@ ed by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
Mass@@ ent@@ ations in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal in the 1970 @-@ s became a genocide of the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since each week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia Explorer for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have intensi@@ fied , as pap@@ u@@ as resources carry a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes because Muslim business immigrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ es@@ ian War@@ ning cant@@ een are ro@@ asted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , served with mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to stop here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ native , who moved to the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke out of the ine@@ qualities and violations of the legislation in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua less changed , and now the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai sl@@ ed only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ ones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness .
they told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an impulse to her tone and later came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so hard hit that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building was set in a fire near the nearby government commission .
about 1,000 young pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they wore a cerem@@ on@@ ial hunting ground and carried out the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle and caused a bird @-@ ges@@ ang - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to s@@ lash stones on police and military posts .
when the mood he@@ ats up , the soldiers were sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses were able to resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; means it was not released in an official document of TIM@@ E which has not been released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Fort@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around me , I got stuck in my left wrist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colourful wooden house .
kay@@ ame still does not know who has fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of encour@@ ages .
&quot; I ran to him , and examined his body to be sure that he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who just bears a name , the TIM@@ E in a glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the chief re@@ actor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure their station , &quot; because they would be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people threat@@ ens to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Inspec@@ tor Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more viol@@ ated .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came first on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
in three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i kept a passionate speech in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to go to the historical app@@ ell@@ ings in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he will establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the laying of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred in a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed to walk these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke in Jak@@ arta in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is legally regulated . &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , who had accused the UN for &quot; Crime against humanity &quot; with more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody crimes of independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ bre@@ aches in Pap@@ ua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai advance .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with fierce anger .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es says .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sh@@ ot@@ ics have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he drow@@ ned in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
upgrades of the company were protest@@ ing in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers put stones on officers who re@@ acted by warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that it will give revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and was a witness , as the injured one was delivered quickly , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament inv@@ oked the officers to withdraw the officers and withdraw the police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a place for the Indonesian government .
lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the ancestors of the Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green High@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by moving spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of ind@@ ones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den K@@ og@@ o@@ ya .
in response , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some never wake up again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic and forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as far reach .
people here build all that they eat : mainly Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a costly only 10,000 ind@@ ones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have since opened new flight gro@@ oves to Nab@@ ire airport in greater numbers .
the few work@@ places that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , there remain evidence of international media coverage .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is campaign were to raise the limitations of coverage to increase transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pac@@ ific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ ese Islands - the UN Human Rights Council - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai sl@@ ate .
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the accus@@ ations from the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to stop the evidence of human rights attacks . &quot;
people on site want that more foreign governments have to know this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura attended their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but remain anonymous .
Indonesia , 2019 , had a further presidential election but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a peas@@ ant military , is located in poor farming and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as an &quot; guilt , &quot; which he has to rep@@ ay .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ers conducted a last symbolic act of faith : the body of an victim was buried on a terrain in front of the police and the military station .
they may never know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget the leaders of their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us , head @-@ in head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai its passage and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps across the tower in just two years , the tor@@ ch tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) is called .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we were standing at the fire al@@ arms and at the scre@@ aming of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; a residents told his name as George An@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais , civil protection authorities said that the units of fire @-@ fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 o GMT ) lost the fire and cool the building .
the government said , working on the provision of accommodations for those affected .
the incident may have questions concerning the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study conducted by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the most important part of the damage was made from cl@@ adding , outer cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in Great Britain , the police told them that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ oble Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a sector in which around 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis band ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by his big Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only supported on two winning sets , but not yet supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but even so very estimated five @-@ sentence classic will remain the traditional rate .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said .
we will continue to work to improve the application .
not only for the vote , after many claims , the finals had come to a neutral place .
new from 2018 will be compar@@ atively smaller details : thus the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will soon have the host rights in the following round .
in order to reduce the cost of organis@@ ers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be made easier and the players will need to complete the new media calendar before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US @-@ travelers forbidden objects into the airplane , find a survey
a survey among fli@@ pass@@ ers showed that more than 20 percent aware or un@@ consci@@ ously forbidden objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security administration are s@@ mu@@ ggle , including at least 6 per cent , which carry out the plane while acci@@ dentally forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had been delayed , that they were wander@@ ing with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers were more used to ab@@ ject the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , the enco@@ res that they were trying to fly with something that was banned from T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X .
the most common objects that were deliber@@ ately tow@@ ed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent of these reported objects with blades caused by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents have also confirmed that they had been deliber@@ ately banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said that it question@@ ed travelers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally brought s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling ware by the airport security and how many things had done inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most often s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled in s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - by security , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA direc@@ tives are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain , which liquids can bring them to or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids forbidden by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a time , the people who T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla @-@ Custom@@ ers Order Order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to announce the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla Model Model 3 .
he has so far signed to review that a part of the customer has with@@ drawn their non @-@ obligation reservations .
next to the always triumph@@ ant numbers on sales increase and even more huge target target , Tesla @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has betra@@ yed another , less glorious number : the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k had applied more than 500,000 reservation for the new car , whose delivery will start .
now Mus@@ k cle@@ ars : of the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 cav@@ ities , 63@@ .000 had been with@@ drawn .
critics always pointed out , that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 in the US and 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation request &quot; completely back .
according to this , 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are currently available in a telephone conference with Anal@@ ysts .
however , that the cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders might be the problem , however , the Tesla head does not believe .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production site .
Tesla has supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles last year .
in 2018 it will be - all models - 500,000 will be one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently under reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there is much delays , the in@@ fusion of reservations could be a problem for Tesla .
because then the company may not prevent dis@@ satisfied customers to run in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reduce emissions from Obama Er@@ a &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
one day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the environmental protection authority to delay its former decision to reduce the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions from smo@@ g @-@ induced air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities compared with respon@@ sive faster than previous administration .
he did not mention the complaint which was raised against his prior destination in a federal court .
it is a deadline that ran for states on October 1 , to comply with the states of 2015 for bott@@ om@@ less zone .
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would have hes@@ it@@ ating for a year to study more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; moving into local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his nom@@ ination by president Donald Tr@@ ump of the Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , had long time been a reliable opponent of environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regul@@ ating the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the newest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeal of Washington decided that the EPA fin@@ alist has passed its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration to delay oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt asks that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards are simply the read@@ iness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely performance of the new standards .
&quot; under previous administration , the EPA often has not observed the dead@@ lines for performing , and then waited for the implementation of activists and others , and in an agreement the date for conducting , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ endants the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by courts , and we take Fri@@ sten seriously .
we also accept the law and authority , which gives us serious . &quot;

the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress are pushing for a more extensive new constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill in the last month of the bill must delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not been made in the Senate yet .
the New York General Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who had accused the coalition of the United States who accused the EPA in this week , said the Group to uph@@ old the legal pressure .
&quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers , which are directly affected by the smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;

Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ den@@ arius church
750 years St. Hil@@ den@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche at the old cemetery @-@ A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16th , at 4.@@ 30 am invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ ary complex a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chant you from this powerful place .
salvation and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors for their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini highlights : &quot; it is a unique village . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel was mentioned in documents for the first time in the commem@@ or@@ tion@@ able parish church of Tum@@ our , including the Vog@@ t@@ ei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark of silver .
according to the charter according to the charter , a magnificent farm , from which the church or the patron saint belonged to the church or the patron saint , was not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , it was next to the sub@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the centre of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the main settlement of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 undergo these historical real@@ ities .
the patron was created from the early medieval town church .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , st@@ owed him with a priest , remained with the owner of this church , and could also inherit the church .
this was the right to insert a pastor , or to propose a new pastor .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two crum@@ bles on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly constructed bell then took place for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during World War II in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows of the window were st@@ aked and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aky .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were in the vicinity of the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ ler &apos;s cemetery served as the last resting @-@ place for the dead .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was canc@@ eled .
only the church tower could be left .
in the New Year of 18@@ 34 a storm fell by the steep@@ le and the half collapsed .
to prevent evil , the tower was canc@@ eled .
only the tower @-@ value today remained as a witness to the 750 year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em accompanied by the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as an organizer invite friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Matt@@ e@@ is .
shortly after the opening of Hartmut Rom@@ ann the final word speaks .
the programme starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
to end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk is held in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers put out the fantastic view .
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hil@@ ary facility , which is of significance for tum@@ ours and hearing loss .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to the home hygiene , as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organis@@ ator Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
club wants to check the permission of windsurfing
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim wo@@ es &quot; does not see any legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned towards the coun@@ cill@@ or .
the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; Association fights &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) , to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind force concentration zone have existed at the time in Vier@@ sen .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines is fundament@@ ally possible , but the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones should prevent &quot; deep@@ ening &quot; of the landscape .
although a few days ago , the town had decided to change a second wind@@ power concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but the Düsseldorf District Government did not appro@@ ve any case , due to a form .
&quot; by the lack of planned legal requirement , the approval appro@@ vals is still un@@ lawful and therefore dimin@@ ished , &quot; said Christopher Columbus , president of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
current state of things : the city council decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an permission of the county government is still standing .
col@@ t : &quot; thus the issu@@ ance of a approval for the creation of wind energy plants is excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the call .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received by circle Al@@ sen since last week , &quot; said a speaker .
the circle takes them for the occasion to check the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with a view on the administrative department at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle didn &apos;t want to express itself in relation to the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company had participated in which the city was involved in four times , lease agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households , which corresponds to around one @-@ fifth of the electricity requirement of all four households .
the NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg at the Hein@@ berg district .
Auto and Tra@@ ctor lights together : woman dies in dre@@ ad@@ ful accident
one of terrible traffic accidents occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Lower wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was killed in a fatal accident .
two other people were injured slightly .
the state road was closed over hours .
after police reports , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch covered a car in the accompanying driving with her 53 year old mother as an accompanying person the L 333 toward Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
the area of Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the business club and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th of September in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants for shopping in the city centre .
as the Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend for the customers to raising its own city away from the usual supermarket product .
therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
domestic companies should also present themselves with their jobs .
in addition , the city centre is to invite the city centre to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the action is not only on inhabitants of the city and the local region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point to the action weekend , Christian König .
the Municip@@ alities and Industry Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the business club and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive downtown . &quot;
these include new deals , such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest and sold out Sunday , talks with all commercial operators and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers for Saturday and the access to parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential will be new or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost the city centre when shopping at a glance .
at the end , all of them would help to revi@@ ve the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
we sailed with a network to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that was partly spread , King had said in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , told that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities are part of the country .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ zi@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also make clear that every citizen can influence its direct environment themselves .

Tr@@ ump translated with trans@@ vers@@ ed tran@@ scripts from telephone call to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary walls
tran@@ scripts from phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked in a phon@@ at with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , to say openly that he would not pay for a scheduled border wall .
the US president imp@@ lied him because he had publicly ref@@ uted the Wall . according to reports he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall , and s@@ wore to Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ Key were also published and disclos@@ ed an ex@@ iting exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ key that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia , &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; that would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would look like a b@@ anning of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said the Turn@@ Key , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists guide ra@@ cial Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driven by a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ ink to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white males came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his path .
the leader of the bul@@ ls - a man of middle ages in a needle @-@ strip - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looking for the wind@@ shield .
inside there the occup@@ ants were caught in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
get it from the car ! &quot;
crying out the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this horri@@ ble scene , played on 22 July , is just a post@@ ure .
but if a loop is thrown by the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them in the audience was very genuine .
since 2005 , Citi@@ zenship has returned to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever indicted for murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really un@@ imagin@@ able that in all these years , no one person was arrested - although we know who they are , &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks said that helps in the organisation of post@@ ure .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman for Georgia and a life @-@ long civil law .
for him , the reproduction as a dramatic call for action serves as a dramatic memory of the Mon@@ roe community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; we want to confirm the prosecution , we want to be healing , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot;
a place of jurisdiction is inscri@@ bed on the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch , on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files , which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ cils have been suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was ever indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free walk for decades , the Civil War that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court adopted a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice to the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in the summer .
at the same time as the election cycle according to the FB@@ I , Roger Mal@@ com became a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , supp@@ os@@ edly due to a woman , supp@@ os@@ edly due to a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ ours in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she had , not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they were then removed from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached the car , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b .
&quot; as it turns out , Harrison that has prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; includes a FB@@ I report .
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murder , and has rejected evidence of the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is form@@ ulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; he was a right hand massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you can register and vote for you , then this will happen . &quot;
Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted an annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de for almost a decade .
their portra@@ yal is illustr@@ ative , moving , and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many believed that he does not exist in America anymore .
it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we will be confronted with the u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I cannot establish a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - stuck in a room and l@@ ur@@ ned when Gre@@ ene had a well played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the head @-@ c@@ lan@@ et since years , but he said that the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life because we don &apos;t want to return to that time . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , who scre@@ ams and urged him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , swal@@ low up my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a del@@ etes the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh at the lou@@ dest point .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , always cra@@ ving .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think white people then &apos; n &apos; n &apos; have said &apos; .
&quot; yet , &quot; funny one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there the energy in space , a sense of camera body replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is engaged to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene is beginning again .
this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
there are cry , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a fun@@ eral g@@ own is about the bodies of the actors and leads cheap Holidays song &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people caught per@@ spiration and tears from his eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
a couple from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as supp@@ or@@ ating moisture , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you found on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de found , the air feels g@@ host@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , record the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mur@@ ing a little boy , as if he would remember .
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the throw away and wi@@ pe her tears off .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw turns Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit which the C@@ lan@@ cher played .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a hu@@ gged two of his players and then breaks up in her arms , the emotional bur@@ dens of the performance ultimately breaks through him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers a women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white couple ha@@ sted from Atlanta , stim@@ ulated by a black pair , which they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski therefore strug@@ gled to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and actions ... from people who look like yourself and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone is holding Broo@@ ks Hof on his table , eating and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post@@ ure is inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own history is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the venture to Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf faces a colourful , six @-@ story scene .
the screen@@ platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ ated road corner with mas@@ on@@ ry and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car , where the Rhine bre@@ eders is po@@ unding as rock power , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stacked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Lad@@ mot@@ iv - money , power and gre@@ ed - that attracts through its &quot; Ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhine pads - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
they have been fighting Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , the Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier put a body into the trunk and give the ri@@ ot o cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings to Hagen , who surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he proposes Siegfried .
later the Gun@@ ther ( Mark oak ) still has to believe .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who conf@@ esses his hands and his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski .
big appl@@ ause is available for the festival orchestra which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in superior leisure clothing .
with excitement , the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team team was expected .
in 2013 , in 2013 , he had to leave the ball @-@ like wh@@ irl@@ wind over himself , there were five years later in which the individual &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ fre@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is expected to rejoice about this .
&quot; it is noticeable that the audience has grown with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with cast@@ or , but it also has grown understanding for its view .
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max amount works as Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually at St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once in the week I am helping in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I already worked at school in the open day of year .
what are your experiences with it ?
amount : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , therefore a late volunteer .
how does this come ?
amount : I did my school@@ ing .
and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , succeed .
I have known for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , working with people .
and then I asked what you are doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the fir@@ ing point maybe even , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester .
I am going to study both , and probably at Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker training and students in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual to have several different types of application during the volunteer ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you make his FS@@ J .
it can make it possible from aging to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ettes of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon support .
that was the right thing for me , which has irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in the construction engineer ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about counting St@@ ati@@ ken .
there has always been other people in mind , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee has been taken out of the family , one must always be considered individually .
very interesting .

P@@ ear@@ son has reduced another 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British Educational group P@@ ear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divi@@ der by 72 percent , as a further restructuring program is started to overcome the pressure being confronted with the company .
the job de@@ mining , General Director John Fall@@ on , mainly for the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 points have already lost .

con@@ voy Attack by Kabul : NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy at the Afghan capital of Kabul , killing a soldier of NATO and inj@@ uring several other inj@@ ures .
five soldiers and a interpre@@ ter were injured , a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that made Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ bed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
in a statement by Nato , the explosion on Thursday night was to be done as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army attacked an impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the testimony tells that all injured in a stable state are in a stable state and be treated at the air@@ field in Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group is known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ bers killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadly mil@@ it@@ ant attack in the country , the Taliban ordered by power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as US president Donald Tr@@ ump is considering to raise the number of U.S. troops , military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kabul in the past few weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government to have caused their policy and in particular to President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay the Smo@@ g @-@ Ru@@ le to Kl@@ it@@ agen
the US American Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to ign@@ ite a regulation of the government of Obama at which the states are committed to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was given a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency because of the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday to push for the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 , &quot; and said they will show the commitment to the agency , together with states .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in fact that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA @-@ conductor Scott P@@ ru@@ itt .
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which in part of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be determined to specify where inc@@ isions have to be made to delay str@@ ingent air quality standards - delayed by a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 most democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to resur@@ rec@@ t a broad range of environmental impact , former president Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that should cur@@ b economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the backs of demo@@ cr@@ ats and nature groups that worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , o@@ zone contains &quot; reducing lung function and can ampli@@ fy the respir@@ atory symptoms , &quot; such as asthma .
congreg@@ ation@@ at wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two cases the council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ ds decides to set up a common room in the future resident population .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining land part is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ adas .
although it still will last until so far the church community has belonged to the community of community , there is no plan for the planning of a private investor from a private investor .
there is a discussion on a common room .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would have a living space - around 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters floor space available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the community stay in front of , such a common room just not as meeting point to watch only for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ atory living places , but open to the community .
for example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Cafe &quot; made the round .
the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current household already last autumn , is determined by funding .
the construction is located in the rehabilitation region .
the establishment of a common room would be , says T@@ j@@ ade , 60 per cent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision shows in order to sign@@ alize the investor to indicate that there is no b@@ ill@@ ary between the legs in this regard - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which reduces the tr@@ asc@@ end and the construction of economic power - as possible .
need@@ less , so do not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this additi@@ ve .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously this is the Panel .
it is not as easy as the common room .
Daniela Call points out to the many own buildings , with whom you do not come before , but now the common room comes out of the window , she says , &quot; I am doing very hard with this . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely responsible for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind a conce@@ aled payout to property or non @-@ Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not just the case , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a supplement but I get a real , in doubt , in doubt , is the counter@@ part .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to submit the decision to the decision , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
so it remains with two oppos@@ ites in the original program to summar@@ ize Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; if we do the decision , we make an enormous step in our infrastructure . &quot;

in the resin of star w@@ ander to star
the national first &quot; star@@ path ad &quot; is supposed to arise in the resin .
this is planning the club Ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ path &quot; come to meet the needs of many Har@@ z@@ vis@@ ers , named it .
it connects nature , science , movement and ath@@ letic performance .
the members want to set up on the scheduled route tables and inform them about stars and stars .
in a first phase to 2018 , the club is planning to achieve good @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
In@@ quire at St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by the Internet .
this is why the site selection plays a good mobile network reception .
acc@@ essibility is a crit@@ er@@ ion .
later the train path is to be extended by train .
&quot; at star@@ path path , the viewer experiencing a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the association .
they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star was stronger than another , although it is much further away .
also , in which constellation can find a selected star and when he is best seen .
the association has been running since 2014 in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
the site in the middle of the Har@@ z national park is part of the Federal Office of Nature Conservation for the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way Galaxy and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy are clearly visible to the naked eye .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the Planet@@ arium &apos;s initiative since 2003 - something similar to the planned star@@ ring - Planet@@ arium .
beginning from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary way leads to Hain@@ berg and the Ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ at@@ erre@@ stri@@ al &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Equ@@ al ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with individual planets - including the down@@ ward down@@ grade Plu@@ to at the end point - are accurately positioned at intervals and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , which measures 70 cen@@ timet@@ res .
the total distance of the planet is just four kilometres .
while the light of sun requires up to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march towards the next match was still half a year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko first meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to produce the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the un@@ defeated World Boxing Council Light Champion , going down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing organization Super spring champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through unanim@@ ous decision regarding the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday to Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top @-@ Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
Garcia stri@@ pped the right hand and said , &quot; How are you going to be champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt to Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 : 00 pm .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Climate , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former sk@@ im@@ balance , &quot; remember Garcia .
&quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down to light weight .
and he must move on lightweight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
the climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight for a date in the next summer with Garcia a date for the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell , according to their lightweight @-@ weight campaign in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; said Garcia and pressed out later to fight with the network that offers the best finance package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Garcia was saying that Lom@@ ach@@ enko was &quot; an enormous mil@@ it@@ ant , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held out with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he would think of the three combat champion from River@@ side . &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you were seeking the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
Garcia said the focus is to show striking mass , then boxing .
both said , they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; this is the battle that must be performed .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; Garcia Garcia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and this is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;

Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; rotating chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 to the season open@@ er against Braunschweig that optimi@@ zing the def@@ en@@ sel@@ ing formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result even if not the two opponents had been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge the thresh@@ olds should also be optimised .
and a gate after a free shot , the Fort@@ unas don &apos;t want to catch up .
&quot; for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is even better to just@@ ify his team in preparation with the rotating chain than with the quadru@@ ped chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is himself safe , &quot; because we have just hit the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; but if one can speak of a mis@@ erable start , I don &apos;t know .
the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and focus on the tro@@ phy , we will surely be able to speak of a good season open@@ er . &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defender of the Fort@@ una .
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland then go to the meeting in the meeting in the final ( almost ) finished Stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to beat from the out@@ set , &quot; explains Fort@@ una chief coach .

new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the reviewed persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the precision of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Pu@@ ts@@ un@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) has started the tests last year .
they should be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ ration@@ ver@@ ket ) , due to errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees , was critic@@ ised .
until today , Mig@@ rations has shipped 6.@@ 880 to test@@ ifying cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 testing from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be &quot; possibly under the age of 18 . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is challenged .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent during the past few months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the Local magazine .
the high proportion of cases where the person has been assessed as above 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers has lied over his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the investig@@ ative person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bl@@ adet susp@@ ects the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , when X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings are made of knee @-@ joints , which are then critic@@ ized by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ized in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the Endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work en@@ comp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if it used earlier or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could say it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson , from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is small .
the biggest risk is in this case , if the person is scar@@ ce below 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
working on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good in the time , it runs super , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , building director at the street police and traffic in the gover@@ ning dium of Freiburg .
in April , work began at the same time on all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is ear@@ marked for October and is sure that the schedule is kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete which is coated with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now reached a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called fr@@ inge cap on Wednesday morning on Wednesday morning .
this is an edge pun@@ ctu@@ ation , which is also used as a company road .
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge unit shall be used on Friday .
and then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way is gone .
the special thing is that it is parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented br@@ oth @-@ caps .
a special feeling of finger@@ tips has the building of lines by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable , which many companies are connected .

AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Protest in Germany with German potato salad
it does not come so often that parties can draw on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring to a hat .
the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag Vol@@ cano ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell too loud in a large election campaign .
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those that are already at the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to AF@@ D errors , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot;
originally the city &apos;s picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful image that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , the president of the forum A world and one of the relevant organizers , are pleased : &quot; great as many people have come together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; fier@@ y potato salad , which could also eat the AF@@ D without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him back .
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly in the railway station , which is just a few metres from the venues .
how did AF@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from AF@@ D volcanic eggs , he tried to try one such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked at first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because of the already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch there is not enough parking spaces available .
so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ es is glad we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
looking at the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ pre@@ platz he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
it also does : at around 20 o &apos;clock there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various Red@@ ner , among them the rh@@ etor@@ ic @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic AF@@ D @-@ president Uwe boy .
in the hall , about 200 list@@ eners , who are waiting for the top elections for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch keep her speech@@ es .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
something more than one hour takes the AF@@ D event , the guests at the fore@@ court have a longer breath , but also there is a long service going on after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can take away - no special inci@@ dents .
trombone meets trumpet
a re @-@ hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ it@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he meets a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea , &quot; or also &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both un@@ ites the lust , not just to cross borders on their instruments , but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res .
thus , Johann Sebastian Bach sounds together with the two like in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music , &quot; combines classical folk music and in the &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ re@@ ist@@ le Nils W@@ els , blend classical , jazz and the free playing to a fascinating total art@@ works .
this core of the program was first performed in the spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer Nils W@@ hale has written specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its particular acou@@ st@@ ics is consci@@ ously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled che@@ eses and will eat it until the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart is quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , which ultimately went bitter .
despite all this , the brunette actress opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with every one who I had known .
or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten gave him that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I always lived and believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered me .
I just liked it not to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially among them she suffered from &quot; b@@ ang Show@@ biz , &quot; but in school time they prefer like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , anxi@@ ous and damaged .
now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially to the public , they do not like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
and perhaps some call me to be un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify myself from all the public . &quot;
West Virginia Governor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
whether you like it or not , the demo@@ cr@@ ats are removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much think ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a major announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and justice did not endor@@ se the democratic can@@ dat@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
justice , who is according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes report that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited a carbohydr@@ ate business from his father .
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee set out an explanation on Thursday night , in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with just 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legal bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the final re@@ jection of a party , which is not able to find a positive , united message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ e lo@@ ys &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world leader of ath@@ letics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a manifest exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be resumed in sports .
Russia &apos;s ath@@ letics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ letics Championships on the eve of the World Ath@@ letics Championships , that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
he said it &apos;s sorry for &quot; all athletes , those who were killed in competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report in the World Anti D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) hints to state @-@ funded d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters .
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation had seen in himself that she has experienced some pretty hot times , and everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment .
&quot; I think it was a very con@@ structive day , and I think that progress was achieved but the Congress does not support the task of Task Force , that this is not the moment that Russia was able to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lets from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the World Ath@@ letics Championships which begin on Friday in London according to strict IA@@ AF criteria .
the manager of the IA@@ AF task force Force , Rune Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfill some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
the drug tests are still in@@ adequate and banned coaches are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
a fun@@ eral for in Mali torn soldiers
in a fun@@ eral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two have been min@@ ed in a helicopter .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
for even un@@ solved agreements , Secretary of Defence Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
she called the two opposing pilots but the &quot; C@@ ould of their experts . &quot;
&quot; we inc@@ line to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .

the Stab@@ le@@ pt@@ mann used a flight operation of the fighting helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regim@@ ent .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Regim@@ ent , to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this crew was not able to overthrow the crash , nobody would have confused . &quot;
doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , the Minister of Le@@ yen not : the duty is dangerous .
but it is also of great importance , &quot; for a country that we are separated by two states , &quot; she said .
after the fun@@ eral service the sw@@ inging were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr was not disclos@@ ed .
Prince Hen@@ rik keeps no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
that shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard finished a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen dis@@ agre@@ es with her husband &apos;s decision , and his name was further in the communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never made an H@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
he retired in 2016 and also puts the title &quot; Prin@@ ter ahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik didn &apos;t get the title and the function he wanted to see himself as equivalent to his wife - but not after death , LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by , the leader of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will be , is still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
born in 1965 , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ zo@@ a , the son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked at the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik has always triumph@@ ed in his almost 50 years of retirement in the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik drove over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did , critic@@ ized .
my Danish was varying , I preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ cks , instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smoke instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ ographic intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
those were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid new choice
CDU and F@@ DP prior to possible majority in Lower Saxony
defe@@ ats Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to go back .
because on Friday the dis@@ solution of the Parliament spoke out .
previously , the surprising exit of a Green M@@ EPs from her country holiday in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the country &apos;s elections , the red @-@ green coalition lost its short@@ age majority stake in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the former Green member El@@ ke T@@ ests founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination by 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; commented on Friday in Hanover .
the CDU fac@@ ulty of Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wishes to recommend it to his faction to record it .
the CDU and F@@ DP have therefore 69 seats in the Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was vice versa .
the new parliament is scheduled for January 14 , next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green regional government now decide whether they could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , ke@@ ep@@ eth it to be inevitable that the Land@@ tag decides to leave his self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
the CDU faction will probably decide on their next proposal on Tuesday .
the state of state also sees the possibility that the parliament pro@@ pul@@ ls the trust of the prime minister and choose a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these opportunities must be legally regulated clean , &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said .
&quot; you will discuss all questions if they are legally examined . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ward &apos;s step , &quot; something curious . &quot;
the polit@@ ician himself stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called themselves as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens challenged the de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group president of Gre@@ ens Anja PI@@ EL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ west extraordinary . &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; in front of the background that there was no content differences , we can &apos;t follow this step . &quot;
SPD Chancell@@ ery candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the overthrow of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ests for the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the head of the Social Democrats on Friday to Facebook .
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re@@ elect the Parliament quickly .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
in her ver@@ ty E@@ it@@ el@@ ty and in her fr@@ ust their personal interests ahead of the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ized the SPD @-@ Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus .
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty home game and tries to beat this political capital . &quot;
defe@@ ats of the CDU @-@ Group Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wanted to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties , El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CDU .
the Group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ v@@ ests , with personal kar@@ mic thinking the outcome of the 2013 land election .
the CDU was then the strongest force of the SPD , the SPD and the Green party had a very thin majority of a vote in the parliament .
Federal Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
the Federal Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editors of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect itself from contaminated eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to accurately view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the st@@ amping pressure .
the Bundes@@ länder offers the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though after all we know , a health haz@@ ard is virtually excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of awareness of the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
however , my house has to be locked up immediately and has been in terms of exchange with Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the selling products are traffic @-@ capable and health @-@ harmless .
if eggs of the resi@@ dual resistance of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , they are not able to traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time , the firms are not to blame .
sitting production facilities and consumer in the same boat ?
according to the knowledge of the production plants , the production facilities are not immediate fault .
rather , it must calculate due to alleged illegal practices of service firms with economic damage .
as always there is too little checking in the harvest .
is it lacking only on the staff or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which have revealed the process .
however , in truth , food fraud and criminal energy never belongs to 100 percent .
just therefore a consistent impact of such events and hand@@ over to the lawyers in cases where off@@ ences may be present , of decisive importance .
I have already made many times already , that I expect a seamless recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and bu@@ zz @-@ capable foods .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer goods and consumers are entitled to rights .
by the pan means , manufacturers , merchants and consumers are in a situation that absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ deli@@ il at the attitude of food supply is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it is consistent across all levels and being worked with high pressure .
I expect all competent authorities that the atomic fact becomes quick and comprehensive .
how the soccer rules of the ball on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered expenses of European football matches will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEFA still because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules that have been called by the UEFA group in 2011 that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ lians from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to over ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can make money loose with security , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar signs and bring it into a galaxy of other stars because of the financing of the team through the energy rich royal family of Qatar .
publishers may apply a lot of money to purchase such a lot of money , but have to help with legitim@@ ate deposits , which allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their pursu@@ it , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ked their support when banks or owners have with@@ drawn their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from its concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - had bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P deposit period , which will run until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to get caught by excessive expenses .
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , across the Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package of package , it can distribute the amount of accounting for the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P &apos;s sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Abu Dhabi , is owned by Manchester City , with most difficult sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) which later was lowered to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members will be limited to 21 players in the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to over@@ take their financial adv@@ ances by combining their revenue by companies that are connected to owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ical company might have the PS@@ G spon@@ ges if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the default market value , the UEFA will not be considered a legitim@@ ate income .
it was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the figure of the PSA course was taken up by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 could be in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have test@@ ified that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be eligible for and such a man@@ o@@ eu@@ ver for the UEFA regul@@ ators can be easily detected .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA will be more attentive to observe every attempt to circum@@ vent rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday .
they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not entitled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a turnover of more than € 10 million with a turnover of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s march by claimed that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it &apos;s a clear case of &quot; financed d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars .
Arsenal manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose Club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state who financed a club .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of the soccer in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new pupp@@ et supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aboard chocolate was produced for Swiss .
now co @-@ operation is possible in front of a possible end : the airline will write the mission ane@@ w .
Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA an appropriate report by the newspaper &quot; Northern Western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
following its current planning , the Air@@ line will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
all products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white sh@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ boards apply to 14 grams per year the flight att@@ endant before landing to the passengers .
Swiss no wanted to do any information about the cost .
at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , this area of industry estimates estimate an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a Sch@@ og@@ gia company it is a prestigious order .
as many applicants are available in the new tender , the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y Swiss .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer is not reachable for a comment .
chocolate bars are distributed on board their flights since 2006 .
before Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss conducted two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ hau@@ l flights , the customers of the First Class with treats of le@@ ak@@ age are p@@ am@@ pered in Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short stretch , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distributed both in business and Economy Class .

this repet@@ ition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ 90s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the pre@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained a original story to speak vegetable , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by going to grow on the core of the g@@ ags - actors &quot; mean age play hor@@ ny children who grow up - nonetheless , they made im@@ possibility to win the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; Ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults is less emotional wor@@ r@@ ying and its par@@ ody more after the wat@@ ering principle of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sh@@ akes the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
on one point , a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates , and &quot; a series of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Rom@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) still not forgotten .

and there is another mad @-@ v@@ icious plot that is included in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it makes a great deal of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ oom Under@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ one of &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old b@@ acker .
it &apos;s the moments of acci@@ dental del@@ ity which could stim@@ ulate this fran@@ chise such as a kind of repeated &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieves what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;

it is a brilliant idea .

there are some beautiful G@@ ags to see ( the police sp@@ ends the time trying to watch chess on TV such as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ ers , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; voice out .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is so very dedicated to tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda - a murderer , which carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it often plays like one .

blow against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police managed a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black @-@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konstan@@ z , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects have been searched carefully , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office of Constance .
there were 15 accused of arrest at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
the officials also presented larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros .
two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects , there were German warran@@ ts .
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in action .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the members of the Mafia is organised drug crimes , violent crimes , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
during the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office of Constance decided against organised drug traff@@ icking in the South German region .
between the state communities in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
thus , the major deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the visor of investigations , Italian citizens with respect to the Italian Mafia .
also a incident on the 27th May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant at the early mor@@ nings , should go to the band &apos;s account .
manner lam@@ ents big g@@ aps in the fore@@ ig@@ ner register
&quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ ig@@ ner register in Germany has significant lack of defects .
this lead to some serious wrong choices for asylum procedures .
the representative for refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen manner , has drawn attention to a media report on large g@@ aps in the country register .
defic@@ ien@@ cies in the existing data may result in part of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations . &quot; result in an analysis done by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the regist@@ ers , ten million people with foreign nationality are collected , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality has not been well maintained in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive or from citizens , the German citizens , and in the register no longer should appear . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data records can considerably slow@@ ed back processes , &quot; says the report further .
in statistics on foreign people , the EU citizens are cap@@ tures that would not have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has begun to send refugee families with children under 16 years of age , returning to Italy if they are travelling there .
this emerged from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker Newspaper . &quot;
in the paper therefore , the BA@@ MF means such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practically no longer possible , the newspaper has been referring to the difficult situation on the spot .
after the Dublin treaty is responsible for the refugees of the EU State , which they first reach .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country .
the office now write the office : &quot; in the meantime , the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy handed over for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) uph@@ olds these promises .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin @-@ Agreement .
the inner political speaker of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; families with children threat@@ ens the lack of asylum in the Italian asylum system of human rights . &quot;
second best results achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from the people living in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach was already available for other people .
at least , at least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
all of Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has meanwhile distributed 100 litres of blood now with his meanwhile 100 contributions .
traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the council guarantee multiple will@@ ingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is brilliant as our body is created for this and we are gro@@ unding the don@@ ors respect that their blood is available for strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; bottom mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .

so many people could benefit from a blood don@@ or .
at the same time , corn enb@@ acher reported from the actions that are carried out in the spring in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach .
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 Sp@@ ins , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ Kreis@@ ky ladder .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have d@@ amped the spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; when they hold interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure .
the polic@@ y@@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank ended with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month , as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % , and adjusted for 2018 to 1.6 % , whereas inflation would likely increase to just under 3 % in fall .
but they indicated that in the coming years , interest rates would be necessary to push for inflation and it said that credit costs may be more than expected in financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package , which was published before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheap financial resources for banks , although it is expected that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billions of sterling pound sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the reality of households continues to reach consumption . &quot;
in return to interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain penalty of monetary policy &quot; for cooling down inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent would be required than markets expected .
the markets currently forecast for the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; step &quot; and &quot; limits &quot; would occur .
the Bank &apos;s down@@ ward growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % in comparison to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the previous year .
it maintained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell to this news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound was at 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures rate the rising expectations on a interest rate and the GDP has increased to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to recover by 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it is easy to recover after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by a rising inflation and minor pay@@ outs , since the van@@ ishing is even worse before it becomes better .
it was added that monetary policy may not stop the income of income , &quot; but it added that the wages are clearly to recover at the end of their three @-@ year cancer . &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , which becomes a part of lower consumer spending .
the decision is made by a year after lower@@ ing interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August , after the sho@@ cking EU voting , which caused the sin@@ king of the P@@ acon .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and the economy .
prior to the final judgment of the Bank on the interest rates , the call was increased after an interest rate , because inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pushed households , whereas three polic@@ y@@ makers were demanding to 0.5 % in July .
inflation was dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them in the coming months .
the Bank said that the increase in relation to its goal of 2 % should be &quot; quite &quot; weak pound . &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ ier , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent recovery of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again as the lending business would like to finish in a positive way .
the market is particularly well @-@ known for those in which the existing De@@ als run out and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many are becoming more popular with free options and low rates . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Medical Service ) aims to bol@@ ster 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV pre@@ valence treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ formation of pre@@ positi@@ onal ph@@ yr@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) which can reduce the risk of risk in high @-@ risk factors by about 86 percent , now provided by the medical service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he stated himself to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year , to pay tribute to the Pr@@ EP , in spite of the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance it .
announced on Thursday , the Chess Federation announced by N@@ HS England Chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; major new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) that described as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the application of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 in all England .
pre@@ positi@@ onal phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before having sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduces the HIV transmission at risk areas at risk of infections .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means to take that enough drug in the body of a person is present in order to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come in question are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a family physician can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex hospital .
the programme is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs during this week after an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP when clinical evidence is collected , as it is used in a large scale , implemented and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said , &quot; This great new intervention should be the far reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and over@@ take effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Ter@@ rence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly in the whole country and that no one has left a risk for HIV .
now , since the Pr@@ EP reviews was proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow @-@ Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delay and re@@ lu@@ ct@@ able implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and termin@@ ate the transmission of this under@@ changing infection .
this attempt takes us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big life live : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not bags and sells her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezz@@ anine to use the spacious ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she entru@@ sted the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to take advantage of 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to solve the submission .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together , without leaving us .
it was not only about designing a simple platform but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled us to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezz@@ anine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille Lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen the reflection is like a window in another room .
at the entrance we offer mir@@ ro@@ red units for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous noise , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used .
hing@@ ed kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is an apartment door .
&quot; a little of engineering went in , &quot; says Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it is very important , so if you slide the door very easily , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ less use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; a real estate agent will occur in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form and carry out a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here they managed to increase the floor space and to use high @-@ quality materials , which provides the room to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into electrical outlets in walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square count of some standard in something completely amazing .

two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confron@@ tation because of one of the largest real estate imper@@ es Victor@@ ias worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors of his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to re@@ tire from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confron@@ tation on the separation occurs in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers spent 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the city centre , the areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Colin - von Paul has been described as a &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company &apos;s office and Paul about a third .
an area of jurisdiction states that Colin owns property valued at $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the proposed distribution of Colin proposed distri@@ butions , which I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in the first monkey in 2015 in 2015 .
on Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed investigation .
the brothers now fight for the control of the existing business - from which Colin , like Paul claims to have excluded him .
Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but throws Paul in front of managing some owners .
in an early monkey , which was submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the argument .
&quot; my Italian heritage wrote that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides held .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants to run the dairy products and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the safety to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property in Colin the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
Colin says he started living in West@@ co when he was &quot; in the last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes to transmit her property to her sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ i Group , whereby Colin says that Mark had paid $ 10 million for leaving the company $ 26 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
either Luke and Mark , Paul &quot; says about the conditions of their financial separation , &quot; says Paul . &quot;
Colin has kept himself very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took in touch with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case was before the courts .
&quot; it &apos;s very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father had not wanted that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he was still in a solution . &quot;
on Friday these hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; says Colin .
Tr@@ ump appointed new Chief of Staff to restri@@ ct the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media , hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , on his first working day with leading employee , he set up a major problem in president Donald Tr@@ ump White House which he would rep@@ u@@ ff : poor information that come into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ iter Diag@@ n@@ osis makes sense , but others have tried to count Tr@@ ump by monitor its media management .
President Tr@@ umps relation to television is back for decades now - and now , where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places , &quot; said the former electoral commission Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to POL@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe this campaign interpre@@ ts do something that we do not know others - that tr@@ umps twe@@ ets have been added to more combust@@ ible without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably never learn about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees work it several times , trouble him from him , then their efforts have paid off .
but no one has consistently prevent it that Tr@@ ump ev@@ okes threats .
a part of the problem exists that people in a White House , which themselves together from competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - dealing with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to bring back the President of strategic reasons .
this was an example described by rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; recent and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press c@@ utt@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that it gets out to find out where they come from .
exactly this happened at the end of February , when somebody rejected a printed copy of an article of Got@@ new@@ .com , the website of the internet provo@@ cation , Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of being at the White House .
although Johnson was banned from Twitter for complic@@ ity in Twitter or that he has no specific evidence , or that he expressed false charges in the past and rev@@ oked them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees on Wal@@ sh . &quot;
gold macher added that the former staff of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective Manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors always strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make the Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
master@@ y Crime received Post of Europ@@ ol
as the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will pray and hoped .
the police have shipped all over Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the ad@@ resses of the sought sever@@ als are not known naturally , hints from the population is hoping to pray .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the promotion that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar of the winter .
the experience would have shown that many fle@@ eting have hidden to holiday stations , named it by Europ@@ ol .
21 postcards made for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online visions have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a tren@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire @-@ series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined trav@@ eller on a war foot@@ ed , which are negoti@@ ated by the municipality drawn dig@@ ging in order to rec@@ la@@ im a field before their houses .
the passengers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a weal@@ thy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of don@@ ors , after they had been kicked out only in May without being deported from one of the buried dig@@ ging , to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the tak@@ e@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed its vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
indig@@ nant inhabitants have taken the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; They are on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they have placed stones on the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact since it was us@@ eless in dealing with the problem .
the traveler were there in May , they were moved and are now back again .
more we arrived yesterday evening , probably even more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham white how to handle it by long walks in order to protect their parks .
I am living in the Stre@@ et@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my congregations , if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
a local resident , who would not be called , said , &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we just have seen the last round of these trav@@ eller , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
the figures have increased this time and even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokesperson on the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and working together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move it as soon as possible .
in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many residents are an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we suggest our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be found .
the house in front of the Gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts will be renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof hotel through the then @-@ time ambi@@ ance company GmbH , on 13 April 2014 , a total of approximately 30 000 nights were lost per year and income by the local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of an increasing number of refugees , which were offered in the county , the hotel building of the Land@@ rat was offered as a collective accommodation , which led to controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted at that time .
but above all the Freu@@ den@@ stein @-@ Mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel &apos;s location and he already spoke of serious interest in the house .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ en@@ ius , with offices in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in Berlin with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ amo and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , a long time building container has been standing before the entrance , and when you enter the house , extensive renov@@ ations will be made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to be destroyed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the whole hotel building is a single building site .
by March there is still much to do .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
all should be called &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a jewel . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
they would not be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already pointed out at a high level of downtown .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual tourists , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael K@@ rau@@ se , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to precisely determine exactly .
less than a million euros , it pays .
the outside facilities will also be placed on front , this is already evident .
in a courtyard a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Investig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair of US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
in the past few weeks , the Panel started work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under appeal to those people .
the newspaper continued the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the broad@@ c@@ aster CNN reported that there is already the first sum@@ ptions of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for long , targeted at the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ umps election team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men should stand up in the election campaign as advisor to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment among the magni@@ fying glass .
the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote in front of a few weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump must move into the centre and investigate the accus@@ ation whether the President of the affair had hin@@ dered the justice .
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to examine the evidence in possible break@@ age cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called bill @-@ cl@@ amps .
mostly they are turned on if it is bigger and controversial case .
the process is always provided behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to charge people under E@@ id .
according to the station CNN , pre @-@ lad@@ tions were issued , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were asked to be asked , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ umps &apos;s consultant and son @-@ eg@@ ers@@ son Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former election head Paul Man@@ a@@ fort he talks about this conversation .
right @-@ right experts said on Thursday evening in US television that Mu@@ eller won &apos;t allow Mu@@ eller to in@@ timi@@ date in his work , and that it should be necessary to act fast .
but it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the implementation of the body at the beginning of a new phase in exam@@ inations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of new revel@@ ations , the President held a speech in West Virginia in order to portra@@ y Russia affair as the campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the issue give the demo@@ cr@@ ats a way to feel good , &quot; because they can &apos;t have anything else to talk about . &quot;
his special advisor to T@@ y Cob@@ b declar@@ es nothing from the implementation of a Grand Jury .
but this work usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ized .
the White House endor@@ se any measures that accelerated the work of the special medi@@ ator on &quot; fair &quot; mode .
the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I won &apos;t be determined against the President .
I don &apos;t have a reason to have changed something , it was the explanation of the explanation .
Mu@@ eller had been only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this R@@ aus@@ al accused were accused of tr@@ ump , he refused to im@@ pe@@ de justice .
Com@@ ey said in June prior to a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for setting the investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President is under great pressure because of the analysis .
according to the representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special investig@@ ator and his employees .
that dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
unlike an independent special investig@@ ator of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Richard Ni@@ xon ordered a position in which he could be fired at the presi@@ dents of the President of the Ministry of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
on Thursday , two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators were submitted to Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antarc@@ tica
in the western Arctic , a gigantic Eis@@ berg has been replaced by the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is , just seven times the size of Berlin .
this shared the Bremer@@ haven Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the big Kol@@ oss sticks closer than a tr@@ illion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers from now to the north and will probably be two , three years until it was melted .
it is 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ir@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to how far climate change played a role in the decline of the Eis@@ berg , according to research information is un@@ clear .
however , in total , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ moun@@ ts for approximately 30 years in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fac@@ simile background .
according to many scientists , this could be connected with global warming .
the broken Kol@@ oss was now a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swimming in the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow in the sea and falls regularly .
Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this lake was the equilibrium of wa@@ xes and dis@@ rupt@@ ing a few years ago .
a complete Shel@@ ter is falling down there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it also promise a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , for the front edge has never with@@ drawn so far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate stand under tension and can be dis@@ sem@@ bled , if a piece ab@@ bre@@ l in a key .
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level since it flo@@ ats on the water and ice as much water as it arises after the melting itself .
however , the loss of closing price causes the glacier to flow directly to the sea and can flow much faster than before .
it could possibly increase the sea level , although only in a small extent , the British research project writes to the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest Sc@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antarc@@ tica after AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
on the main road from mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural to@@ es and not aware of a direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the longest withdrawal since the start of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists may be argu@@ ed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will again grow back or long @-@ term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers adopt the demol@@ ition of this gigantic Eis@@ berg to climate change , so many ice @-@ bells of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula have been dis@@ continued in recent decades .
this long tick of the Antarc@@ tica goes towards South America .
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice @-@ area of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase contributed to decline .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees around the past 50 years and thus counting on the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CDU wants to accept pets at the staff
because it becomes more difficult to occupy freely setting positions , the CDU calls for the employer to become more attractive .
just shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag spent 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the district management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind .
the teaching positions are evi@@ den@@ ced very cov@@ eted .
there were approximately 620 applicants that were registered for the seats this year .
nevertheless , the circle l@@ acks further staff to cope with increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , physi@@ cians and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CDU would like to sei@@ ze the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag as well as the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG can engage in the administration of skilled workers in the administration .
according to the request of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for HR production and personal development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term regret , but also to counter@@ act the applic@@ ant &apos;s short@@ age , says it .
the overall concept was to be orient@@ ated within and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ drop@@ outs and involve an expression initiative , the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG are demanding .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has it to do with personal problems you did not know before .
other towns advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , disease or age @-@ related persons comes from the service .
the highest time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
however , Klaus @-@ Dieter races , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint request with his party .
he had long ago already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ ath@@ ic surprise , when he publicly exhibited the def@@ ec@@ cl@@ ings publicly in question and the remaining parties were amazed .
people want all the options to be checked out , which enable a withdrawal from the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU , employees and officials have tried to pay better than the public service for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently not mandatory , increases or more money only when you change to a higher stage , oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are growing more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone of an NGO @-@ mig@@ rant rescue
Italy has NGOs that use the life @-@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ns that they are not allowed to continue with new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign any new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Home Secretary Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Minn@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth R@@ ained &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traff@@ ic@@ kers in a way which lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation only for one year , refused to express a detailed advance of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can only assess all claims that are currently collected , after we have collected all information and assess the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had super@@ vised the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ained &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , super@@ vised since October .
it is assumed that his crew took up ding@@ h@@ y @-@ mig@@ rant , which can be delivered directly by human traff@@ ic@@ kers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can leave , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was report@@ edly took place in front of the Libyan coast only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of susp@@ end himself to the authority of Italian coast @-@ guards , which super@@ vis@@ es rescue races in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ if@@ s .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officers who super@@ vised their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations , have previously prepared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable no &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; would bring their b@@ ail@@ out to their b@@ ail@@ outs .
among those who refuse to sign him is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation doctors without limits ( MS@@ F ) .
in the past few weeks , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants returned to Italy in recent weeks has declined sharp@@ ly that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal weather and the cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister .
he announced plans for further convers@@ ations with Libyan Citi@@ zens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin Foreign post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern pf@@ alz , to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and land@@ marks .
three be@@ friend guides were available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led during hot summer temperatures in the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the äl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ besie@@ ged levels .
in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long trial .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival .
again , the view@@ point re@@ lied to the view@@ point , linked by &quot; flo@@ rets &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate ascent .
on the last two days many elev@@ ation had been reported .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and h@@ uts brought the welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers at@@ tained a healing Sole in the Freil@@ u@@ ft@@ or@@ at@@ orio .
Neu@@ stadt has also been controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of grass - shoes equipment for e @-@ sport
will the Sport Stars stay in front of computer consoles , rather than swe@@ at@@ y with wind and weather to fight over the St@@ adi@@ on@@ ras@@ en ?
fact : e @-@ sport is long since become a serious business to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - huge stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high charges included .
these have also recognized the first federal lig@@ aver@@ s who are increasingly involved in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , which was followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded a E @-@ Sport section in mid @-@ July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to enth@@ use all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says President Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure that several clubs can asc@@ end on this train . &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup , FIFA World Cup , organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which Gam@@ er will compete against each other in various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried all kinds of markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract you could be present online far more often in these markets , than once in the year to send the federal government to Asia .
why is it exactly ?
in the E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation are fo@@ stered on competition level .
long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ gen have also established itself in which the pros can compete against each other .
and in the Asian games , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it just a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly used to get used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ y has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is compet@@ iti@@ vely and found many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also need cognitive abilities , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console but also train their body and look for nutrition .
&quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more a theme . &quot;
controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of classical Sports are missing .
the scientists emphas@@ ize the high integ@@ rative effect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are international , like a big global family , there is no inter@@ cultural inhibit@@ ors .
a study by the consulting consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) pre@@ dic@@ ts to E @-@ Sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
sales are expected to rise to 130 million in three years .
against the almost 2.4 billion euro in the Bundesliga , this is a little bit .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far away from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advisor .
International and many countries are already continuing .
great markets are Asia and the United States , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez are taking part in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ sport competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
also in Europe does a lot .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ atic .
in the Netherlands and France , the So@@ ccer League clubs according to D@@ utt , are obliged to establish an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ President R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , is no longer sufficient today .
it is therefore the tradition of the association to preserve but the company is at the same time to set up the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; you can &apos;t hold fast , that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot;
poison @-@ eggs - The egg @-@ alternatives for cooking and baking
almost all federal states have been affected by the sc@@ andal by gi@@ fted eggs .
Al@@ di South and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted and sold all eggs from the sale in Germany .

Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , was committed suicide for suicide .
a woman from Massach@@ us@@ etts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was condemned in June because of the killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said to the hearing on Thursday : &quot; my family is inevitable .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years but her legal representative argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy had suffered a mental illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream color bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward , when she was convicted .
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the At@@ tor@@ ney at the court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own life better .
she did not assume responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has not shown a repent@@ ance . &quot;
but Car@@ ters had a lawyer , it &apos;s a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance for it to be completely regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor is reading a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it was &quot; no day , I am not entru@@ sted to the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sister &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said they will never be persecuted by knowledge , &quot; she will never be able to take part in her brother &apos;s wedding , or a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; not more to have this single person , with whom I had been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will keep staying with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massach@@ us@@ etts that makes it a crime to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was killed by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text news releases , that she encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; Hän@@ g you , spring from a building , don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation .
in the moment before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you must do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter searched attention through the death of Roy where he ordered that they should benefit from any press .
the case shared the legal opinion .
to the few who defended Carter , Amanda Knox , who was convicted of murder of her British co @-@ resident in Italy in 2007 , was acquitted before two years ago .
Fort Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was running at the Audi Cup as a captain , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern faces the match @-@ fed Cup winner a big season - not harm you extra motivation .
anything was different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich looked immediately , even if the extra piece was very small .
but since far and wide at the second day of the Audi Cup , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel Neuer has been to see , he made the hur@@ ry to be divided into the arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the winner of the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bayern captain .
good , the entrance could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could interpret the symbol from the coach .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen in the professionals , de@@ but@@ ant and just out of the holiday experienced professionals of existing C @-@ El@@ f as a toy leader , but he .
sugar is a@@ est@@ ing to those who want to give a lot of love that you want to keep in mood .
whoever has been chosen to compete for L@@ ah@@ m &apos;s heritage can only use a small extra motivation .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was equipped as mini L@@ ah@@ m across the field .
right behind , this is now its position , the white binder at the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich took part in this starting information as the one who can also take the rod in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with herself .
V@@ idal therefore , with his lack of fitness to play ( foldable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the dev@@ ils , go out on the achievements of the Asia @-@ journey ( folding also only due to ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le could not drop a negative appearance in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense , both were so@@ vereign so@@ vereign .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm is very difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le also tried to get a few times even in the playing construction .
his colleague Rud@@ y said that the result was &quot; not so , as we were hoping for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during their debut .
game shift , tempo change : &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot;
as unusual , this Bayern World is still looking for re @-@ coming , you saw in connection to the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave not one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , instead of six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich said goodbye after a few g@@ un@@ ting statements in his new poker player .
there he heard an interesting phr@@ ase by Sü@@ le : &quot; what is going on here now I have noticed .
with Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he must not teach the new one more .

company satisfied with rh@@ ap@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z minister : Economy lo@@ dges Wis@@ cratic Tempo
it is often not irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able to have the relationship between the land and the regional economy as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor Economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than one year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ mar is att@@ acking the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al in infrastructure policy is called Nat@@ us in Infra@@ structure Policy : the L@@ ück@@ er of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now on top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 is to stand for the construction .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ber@@ ung Trier , which stands in the int@@ ru@@ sive need of the Federal Constitutional Plan .
the goal is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ speaking Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees in this a sign to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) develops how from Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase in super@@ markets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to create a company &apos;s own company .
in Trier , the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro for the Compon@@ ent Master@@ test and 2500 Euro is provided , when graduates within ten years can make his master training independently .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction could quickly create facts , at the same time , it commands to the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , managing director of the Chamber of Industry of Trier .
of 56 new engineers who wants to set up Wis@@ sing at the regional company mobility , are until now only 29 places occupied .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be distributed to external offices .
in 2017 , the CDU &amp; D Christian Bald@@ auf extension refers to the calculations of the host country , the country invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and more in the receipt of national roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects the country &apos;s concept as it wants to fix the labour in the region .
furthermore , the old broad@@ band expansion was in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated power supplies in an I@@ HK survey with a note of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ding Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the board of wind power company Pro wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they had already cleared the field after four months due to dis@@ agreements .
Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ performer faces a counter@@ acting campaign
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ it diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , plants to neutr@@ alise the exhaust gases to install exhaust gases , also take out what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful auto companies and to ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate emissions of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices to comply with emissions , but when a car was tested , but during normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are explored on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former director of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ik was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former Manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be placed in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities have acc@@ eded up a system to deal with emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be elu@@ sive : the luxury car manufacturer carries over propor@@ tion@@ ately to the Volkswagen win .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar

and that &apos;s no exercise , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the building site wants to be clari@@ fied .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the start to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar @-@ visitors .

Mor@@ dil@@ los an@@ enn@@ es and the laughter of suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was tempor@@ ally one of the best published cartoon animation , the kin@@ em@@ ulation of his characters are its trademark .
also with 85 the Argentin@@ ean is still working and works in a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he struck himself among other things as a drawing for congrat@@ ulation - what fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the most fortunate day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 1960s , the breakthrough : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo has many fans .
and again the artists were inspired by cities .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures are in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , his own data is still sitting on the drawing , working almost ten hours a day .
calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush animals and clo@@ cks are still taking plenty of spread worldwide .
he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the main actor in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los arbit@@ rar@@ ily animal in his drawings , which has an exchange of exchange as a counter@@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that will come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he looks more on the TV show , which is produced as its original drawings .
lav@@ ender from Provence climate change threat@@ ens
he has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the circumstances rec@@ alled due to d@@ rought conditions and due to the illnesses caused by the diseases that scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agr@@ arian Research Institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence was effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and in autumn , much more .
this has effects on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium transfers the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only woven for tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than long vegetable watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , sub@@ developed and either lack or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered in consideration includes a better water distribution and slow@@ ing down of evap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .

the murder of an journalists under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet normally on Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ceas@@ ing drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was told to tell you that it is important to change their routines .
discus@@ sing two high @-@ ranking journalists , which feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were in 2009 the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or at home .
security experts have three words written on a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perception and abdominal muscles .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of getting the secret list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no rest periods of violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , there are always more journalists at this time : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to took office in December 2012 , at least seven killed in seven countries this year .
the latter is the editor and her In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence linked to drugs .
his lack is felt deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , representing his mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hangs in the three @-@ thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear T @-@ shirts , who show his ridi@@ culous face with glasses or typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though 2010 was a general meeting of the At@@ tor@@ ney General to process the cases of journalists , this led to the committee to protect journalists from only two pen@@ al procedures .
as in most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , which are joined by drug traff@@ icking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers are only rare in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are inevitable and although the terrain is still tra@@ ced .
without information about the killer , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we &apos;re suspic@@ ious . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced by his car and was shot at him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is being translated with the &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s arrest in the past year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January was Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , since ri@@ val fac@@ tions were fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that Sin@@ al@@ oa should be shot every day or more people on the street , or that the cemetery is full of galvan@@ ised , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug din@@ ers that are larger than many houses for the living .
remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trading routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the debt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ standings have contributed to the murder .
first of all there was the publication of a interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos; sons .
this release might have been anno@@ yed by the sons , susp@@ rated power members every copy of the edition when she was extra@@ d@@ ited to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was to force Val@@ dez for the conf@@ ession of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for his own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues could im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he was an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without h@@ itting the in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ant problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the brave and honest reporting , and the turnover and advertising took place .
rep@@ orter loved it to release hard meetings without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drug history , wherever it was .
he gave himself up voluntarily to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ al@@ oa is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October .
&quot; you must take over the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I do not want to be asked : &quot; what have you done about so many sco@@ oter ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could flu@@ ke a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted to his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite from the office , and sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine practice ?
his death has also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their home run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not permitted , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ chan@@ cell@@ ing and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply no more - just as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the employees met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce on safety training , suddenly there were no phones allowed . days earlier has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
there were two polic@@ emen outside the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the regional government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ floor district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen that the Governor himself did not have trusted .
it is months ago , since rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug ties de facto are under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blocked three main stories .
there was the murder of the former famous writer Julio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , which focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the State Theatre , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it was so , so there was caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite bar of drug traff@@ ic@@ kers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter learned from public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician who ruled the ruling Inst@@ itutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled the whole century all the political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the rep@@ orter of writing about previous inci@@ dents in this place , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers received the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body st@@ ature .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected , activists in the name of the press .
Rep@@ or@@ am Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez caught a few signs and went in the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists have become stronger in the whole country by having written down in organized protests in the SOS Press .
this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa , on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to destroy journalists and destroy them , because they said the truth .
she has asked that she was once again divided by the government , because she is worried that their anger has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez repeatedly had said that journalists in Mexico organized by organized crime , en@@ cir@@ cled by the government officials and a valid society . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orter were not only killed by drug candidates , but also on orders of politicians and security forces with organized crimes under a blanket .
the media group &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; conducted more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you hold your mouth , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ getting the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern borders of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that allegedly signed by the Candi@@ date cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were beside her separate head .
some stores have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern borders of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo following the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez introduces the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled from their own states or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and still observe the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as it seems apparently the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , is to find that drug traff@@ icking are fri@@ ghtened .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became rep@@ orter , &quot; he said .
at midnight , on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat down at the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , as at once all their teleph@@ ones began .
a series of shooting paintings featuring band@@ aging and security forces near the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as it was promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge , they have published news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on cell phone .
the front page had to be changed the following day .
Sir@@ enen he@@ ats near - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the police officers who thought guard to see if they were will@@ ingness .
if they were afraid of all , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the famous founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ al@@ oa , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; If on the same day , Javier has been murdered , the train@@ ee asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a fri@@ ghtening .
now , researchers have found out that the first insights of the incredible Nas@@ horn of an Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa by din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his scal@@ y skin was from red@@ dish brown - and they said it would have had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report published in Current Biology &quot; published it as the ster@@ y @-@ held Dinosau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
being incredibly well preserv@@ ated state , researchers created it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the Ar@@ mo@@ red plant ore is the best preserved F@@ ossil in its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was near Fort Mc@@ Murray on 21 March 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , and gru@@ b .
he met something which looks out of the surrounding rocks of the place , and decided to look more precisely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years in order to expos@@ e the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you &apos;re only a little blind eye , you could almost believe that it &apos;s slept , &quot; said the master author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible .
&quot; there will be one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - Mon@@ a Lisa and Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant @-@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , and resembles a changeable tank , probably threatened by the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white clo@@ ak to hide in front of prey , and used a par@@ atro@@ city that is known as counter@@ att@@ ening , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to expand its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now shown at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have studied the wild animal and it was called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the astonishing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , to document the patterns and the form of scales and arms over his body .
they discovered the border sh@@ ady , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the border is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals survi@@ ves today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ asted enough pressure by the flesh of the v@@ ore din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the confron@@ tation of the confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that have the reverse sh@@ ady - think of deer , Zeb@@ ras or gir@@ dles - are much smaller and vulner@@ able than prey , which is sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; strong Rau@@ b@@ tier behavi@@ ors on a solid , strong pan@@ ick@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs , how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs have been to have been the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on critics above his life , including its conservative intestinal , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , was caught up into a river and was driven into the sea , where he sank to the sea .
at that time Alberta it was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with conservative skin , but also available in three dimensions and preser@@ ves the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly like in the early cra@@ yon .
you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just play a little with the eyes , you could almost believe he is at sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when giant Ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , stood on two legs crossed on earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tonnes heavy monsters .
the scientists who appear to appear in Current Biology indicates that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after the death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fies in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , in the vicinity of Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta .
according to the museum it is the survi@@ ving din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant swe@@ ater was curved by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater state of the din@@ osau@@ r store his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the hood still cover b@@ ump@@ y tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a winning in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that wear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards .
I can count the scales at its sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
he@@ fty accident on Thursday night on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass b@@ low@@ age .
there are numerous dist@@ ill@@ ings , kilometres and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A8 ) , on the late afternoon afternoon , some 20 people were injured at a mass @-@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
the first data on the police were at 17.00 hr@@ s. between the connecting places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , under 30 vehicles , including trucks , inter@@ connecting them .
there are no statements about the exact number of injured .
it is about slight to moderate injury , said a pol@@ ishing pre@@ cher .
a big array of rescue vehicles was at the accident point .
the A8 was fully locked towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , some ten kilometres long back was formed .
like a AZ rep@@ orter , it also appeared on the road to massive im@@ pedi@@ ments - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade settled down the license plates of the vehicle , which now have to count with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occ@@ ured on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ lease .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ ering .
the Schaff@@ ner comes and w@@ akes up an uns@@ ett@@ led or irrit@@ ate the gli@@ ast in the middle of the workflow .
card control .
but the times of breaks are over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the single card control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that is taken to be taken and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; when the offer comes , we will expand it .
it is expected to be available at many further routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; said a slide @-@ speaker .
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; is called by train the card classification without Schaff@@ ner .
to use them , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and one has to have booked an online ticket - what already do most passengers do .
it also has to have purchased over the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and lastly , you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : it is asc@@ ending in the train , calling its ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot;
the test client then appears a button for electronic validation .
the att@@ ack@@ ers get a message on their mobile devices that chassis X is located on the train and took the booked seat for Y .
in case of ticket inspection at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already taken online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on to keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the clients , one for the rail - which in turn is to take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; who wants to travel without ticket control by our train crew , check out in the DB Navigator .
this enables the passengers to design your travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing executive board of DB remote services .
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs . &quot;
those who often travel , knows that , beside the delays and pas@@ sports , the ticket @-@ card controls are one of the biggest trouble .
because often one does not have any documents in any case , but one of them does not need any documents which you need for analysis of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or the ID card or the ID is missing .
the result are endless discussions between train att@@ itudes and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the advantage or greater space and delays in control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner takes the time to take care of other issues .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart food .
more traction numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel was sh@@ aken up to her heart .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll@@ ded by Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from High School .
&quot; the police just killed an 18 year old child and it is still on the road , &quot; it was there . &quot;
confused when nobody had posted the information on their feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ arded on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who was killed live by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live .
he posted a picture of brow@@ ns le@@ she@@ er body , stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; it is wild , &quot; he thought Fer@@ rel .
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she moved her mobile phone to record twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and by a man who claimed to be his father &apos;s father , who bore a sign with the in@@ scription , &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
it observed a live Feed where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of protest@@ ers with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she said , secured a other polic@@ eman his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; remember@@ ing their testimony .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and which we call ourselves typical . &quot;
at that moment , I felt sc@@ ills .
I was mad and cried . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Fer@@ rel with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , the two had a conversation , which they had plenty of times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for this , what do they believe ? &quot; remember what she said .
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
I could not bring them away , &quot; said Fer@@ rel later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
she needs to know and see it , and they will be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves .
even if I have luck to give her a experience , in which she has not seen strange rac@@ ism , she is no different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was waiting for a camping area than the activists on the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel and her daughter have joined with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to transfer them to protest@@ ers .
slowly , a new type of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m began to take shape for fer@@ al shape .
&quot; my ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m changed totally after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ se Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel met , during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document what happened .
one question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of white - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview , &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct .
his commitment brought about the project Fer@@ rell , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result we show documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls live , as she got in love and her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history is repe@@ ating the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
in 2012 , two of the three founders of the Movement , who formed the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identi@@ fies the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women need to carry the main load of everything . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is held really of black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it is in@@ sist@@ ed that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ful type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who shook her energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , although it was on the front line , because in a life on these cros@@ sings as a black , gay woman stands as much on the game .
you can sense her energy through the screen . &quot;
the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connection between the church and the police remain .
fer@@ al is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway in a demonstration .
she describes the social environment of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she is committed to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , even though it is not yet built .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian zone p@@ ushes the population in pro@@ pon@@ ent and ad@@ vers@@ aries since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold leaves the subject very cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be a real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ earing ) or quite simply : &quot; size ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents are building that a gallery will take more customers into the city , and the other shops will fear , that then the pedestrian area will be bleeding .
in addition , the gallery will be planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market stands , in the 13 direct market share their products .
the construction work will begin at the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a place with the possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost every week in the farmers market .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are very happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s but@@ cher .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct market is located in a market hall in the gallery , the rent is to rent .
the new project should probably not be low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is shopping for shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ y@@ fish or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
you see how many shop@@ pers can stand here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is the more important that at least the market hall remains .
because at least the product offered is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is pri@@ med in charge .
as you see , shop@@ pers are rented in a shopping mall just by larger companies , because the rentals are often not portable .
too bad , special stores , there are almost no more and what still is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping mall with a Mark@@ thalle suits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market stands out during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit Gallery is actually coming .
or does it already take the ghost bit gallery previously to distribute all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will not work .
and a shopping center that stands blank , no one needs .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a striking hall , it is thanks to the crazy many - as I find - sensu@@ al construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no place any more .
when the farmhouse is cap@@ turing , a piece of culture will van@@ ish again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces have to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from Wan@@ gen @-@ T@@ up@@ side and hair@@ cuts , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they publicly traded diplomatic announ@@ cements on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline took their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a tran@@ woman and a pione@@ ering dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation had been converted from Barack Obama only three days .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA which could look from Mann@@ ing and out of the 30 portraits , such as some intellectual commentary can not only be created with these genom@@ ic data , the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent detection of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , was found openly about the identification as a woman , in 2013 was sentenced to 20 charges , including six violations of the esp@@ ion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
the prison was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde v@@ ig bears with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ ic arti@@ facts like cigarette st@@ umps and che@@ wing gum by extracted the DNA from the waste , in order to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg announced at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at this time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were w@@ asted to exter@@ min@@ ate several letters in the course of two years .
they even created a Comic at Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Comic &quot; sou@@ ps images , &quot; who would predi@@ ct the future and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing would release following seven brutal years in a Kansas Military Pr@@ ison , was a welcome kind of happy support .
there is also something deep in the opening of the exhibition some deeper and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops , in order to remove new , twe@@ eter ways , which he should fix , further to discharge .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg is asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a specific reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with its over@@ size signature &#91; the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ide after the advanced scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly , at least in biological ways we are all .
&quot; what people hopefully will take away is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective it , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ ur@@ ious memories , is also shown .
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is stored in an own room is a page from the above mentioned Comic @-@ Nov@@ els .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it emerges with a release of hands in the hand out of the discipl@@ ines of the United States , such as king @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they ch@@ ill your words , then they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m getting go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the show personally - just as they were supposed to do in the comic book - but when they should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , of their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ulators , like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing st@@ ature ) , with which their genetic Hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said by the portraits .
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement , forming itself with Chelsea , as the movement , which was also behind her liberation . &quot;
University of Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford for the murder
a nation@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and a employee of the University of Oxford which had been chosen as susp@@ ects , after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts due to murder because of their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the district court of Cook County are shown .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ ls .
a warning system published by the Chicago Police authorities said that the body was discovered on July 27 .
civil servants received a call , came in at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still alive at the place of events for dead , and Det@@ ec@@ tives examine the bul@@ ations as murder while police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects .
L@@ ath@@ em has been a professor of biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em will now be judged and excluded from the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the relevant authorities , and nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates at this study , &quot; said Cub@@ bage .
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any imagin@@ able manner . &quot;
the testimony was added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demanded the susp@@ ects to challenge the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea of her place of residence , and our efforts to locate it , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pet@@ alled tip that was something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the time axis and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible case . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice President Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA timetable has been updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the road@@ map of WA@@ DA for compliance with the Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko he contains nothing , which could cause a concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agencies approved the reported results of the d@@ ossier by the Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren to have publicly sponsored by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren .
referring to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation since our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has put an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not admit something that exists . &quot;
mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales outlet R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v was problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly told that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ conditional , &quot; sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als at WA@@ DA by the implementation of d@@ oping controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy wants to compete with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the pol@@ ls did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - g@@ rie@@ ve .
and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust in the process .
&quot; it has never been texture and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Sal@@ t who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society and Madison Re@@ ed .
she called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of the employee engagement , it enables companies to arrange special groups and demo@@ graphic groups to offer employees An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allows to handle the C @-@ suite exec@@ u@@ tives and contact directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees .
salvation said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and pol@@ ls of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that shows that units have the most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives have low supplement results - so that you can drill , why .
companies come to see that you have to remain at the fore@@ front of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t have the next U@@ ber , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , since then a former employee has published a blog post that have spoken a field of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance @-@ sector will have more than $ 1@@ 18,@@ 7 billion value by 2020 , following the finance technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year am@@ id@@ st the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Company lets you send chosen &quot; swe@@ s- &quot; pol@@ ls to collect confi@@ dential information in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which can report bad behavior .
and if the leader is included , complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of Public opinion covers the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that his staff is treated badly or in@@ eth@@ ically , it may experience costly consequences arising by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and g@@ ages , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent for more than one year has been used to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , when an employee wished to report a problem , he had to submit a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS general Coun@@ sel , who said it was not a good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
well , since the company conver@@ ters conver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden from managers who were hidden in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair inter@@ ce@@ - faster and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law . &quot;
companies started to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Employ@@ ees in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed due to the Enron sc@@ andal caused by Enron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the businesses with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval by venture capital investors , supporting both start@@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million for funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter@@ ing secured $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inserts .
the staff want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ iten when their portfolio companies are well run . companies run well if employees are dep@@ loy and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools do not promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you find support .
the data on employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless , if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have a promise that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International who has seen the company very much for collecting data .
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow workers , &quot; Don &apos;t you really hear me ?
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I take ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly employee surveys now , was able to introduce measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so deliver@@ able .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the staff , and it is hoped that for a long term , this leads to a better binding of workers in a industry which is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose humans , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the crash
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers chat on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have drawn their tri@@ bun@@ ks and show the back of silence from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ paid minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are registered to the summer courses are returning after the dirty exercise , before they return at 6 : 30 to the water man Football Center next morning .
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a true Tre@@ t@@ mühle , &quot; said Bru@@ der @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday .
N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players , and it actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three trainings of U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 a.m. , in order to fulfill the already packed time schedule of the player .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the brood moved almost one week after the last season , during the summer school during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
in the course of August 18 , you should pause 18 exercises at the beginning of formal pre@@ set preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that it supports the change of the N@@ CAA , even if they add a further point to the race routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they simply put it , they plac@@ ken continued ; they are great people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , in view of its fields marked by a adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale , which is already covered with foot@@ balls , which will be no easy task .
brood @-@ players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a reveals that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ brought to think that people rent a room there and then adjust it to sign up an exercise .
if you have the video and exercise of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false statements by third parties and their results in the original contribution then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called F@@ ake News .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible fal@@ tering and to send them to fac@@ tions , which may display results of the fac@@ simile examination from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ized as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , many of whom have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be a test of the new facts review .
&quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories of fac@@ tions were challenged by third parties , people want more detail to make @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature in the &quot; related article &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was a swal@@ low for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ er years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbul@@ ent history of his cozy headquarters in the ir@@ l River valley in K@@ ent , and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look to the writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages until the era of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac handle@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it &apos;s not the first book of Rho@@ des which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b @-@ print on the side of a letter that was written by a double minded man in the 1700 @-@ s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters always smell after smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the od@@ or has a effect as if he himself would be there .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who has been defeated so with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have considered a little over to my welcome &quot; ) seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Victor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , watching the archives and the many treasures and curiosity of the castle , like about the mon@@ stro@@ us of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emigrated through the land and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape @-@ care , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received the full access as the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to worry about the archive , which he spoke as &quot; hundreds of years , in which ar@@ ist@@ o@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what he had said : &quot; they could mean that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to tune in to the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il , which appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peas@@ an@@ try began in this area and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good start .
perhaps the two are linked together ? &quot;
other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it tomb , hidden in the English Reformation for seven years .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , represented in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , produced his own bur@@ ial , filled with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a g@@ aun@@ er , getting back debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men del@@ ve their school @-@ birds , giving them rich old women , I imagine them as a he@@ ap of good looking guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise . &quot;
after the end of his bet in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been returned by nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with that accur@@ sed life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his head team want to keep the logo and slogan secret by Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August there will be a highlight of the campaign on the Island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , ask the makers of action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we think it ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them online on her yesterday website .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that something is better than it seems .
basically we are the firm belief that we know as bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer people around the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
with the action it is more than &quot; just a logo and a slogan , it &apos;s going on .
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a sole promise , one that gives the city a distinctive design feature . &quot;
eventually they arise in competition with other municip@@ alities .
the city &apos;s Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f lets its new umbrella brand and the campaign cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount .
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Ear@@ og@@ ans An@@ xi@@ ety in front of the Army
every year in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) publishes on pen@@ sion@@ ings and subsi@@ dies in the officer cor@@ ps .
like this week too .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was not held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the presi@@ dency also participated in the presi@@ dents under the presi@@ dency of the government , as well as the five vice @-@ presi@@ dents and the Minister of Defence , In@@ ner@@ es , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
by doing so , civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number .
the government moved the re@@ ins in the military .
general Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were cancelled .
since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ miral channels .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees the Erdogan as a wire @-@ loss .
against 4@@ 86 people who should have been directly involved in the coup attempt , will have been involved in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the overthrow of a &quot; divine gift &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the forces . &quot;
but does Erdogan really have a grip on ?
in late February the newspaper &quot; Hur@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there is concerns of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manif@@ ests itself in the repe@@ al of the head@@ scarf ban for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the large cleaning process in the army and the security forces continue .
in mid @-@ July Erdogan as@@ signs another 73@@ 95 state service , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
there seemed , that Erdogan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they sli@@ pped on their role as ke@@ epers of the sec@@ ular state of state .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erdogan is heading towards the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; an un@@ named officer , who sought for asylum in fear of persecution in fear of persecution , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and lo@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
if this is true , NATO could not leave Nato cold .
anyway , in the alliance , there is dou@@ bts about the read@@ iness to help the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and oper@@ ation@@ als are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; said Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he sees prior to lower@@ ing the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , str@@ ingent provisions for vis@@ itation of vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and limitations for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do that by the US will change the way of citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
this new candidate procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that will benefit from our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate the route for Renn@@ es shuttle
again , over the past few months had been cont@@ ested by the future of the sla@@ b sh@@ utt@@ les - now it is said to go quickly .
at the end of the year the tour is scheduled to be built , on which the tour train runs .
in order to secure the future of the racing platform long term , according to the Department of the Department of Transport , construction work is scheduled to start this year .
&quot; with the decision to continue to order and refurb@@ ish the distance of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly familiar with the tourism important link , &quot; said traffic state Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the repair of the track has reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
by that sum , the country exceeded 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will now be final agreed , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the South @-@ eastern railway as operators are already in charge of technical details .
&quot; thus , the timetable , which are used for vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race @-@ st@@ iff shuttle should be ordered to be available on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is an especially popular rail link between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
during a pilot line in the past few months , the distance of sufficiently many people had been used to order them again in the future .
the route is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought it can &apos;t be any more crazy in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascent seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will get them much more common , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key when publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exports have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone gum which feels warm - with deliber@@ ately human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust its robots accordingly to their convic@@ tions , &quot; and select everything from the rob@@ otic colour of the robot on the form of the ni@@ pp@@ le to the type or colour of its fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is wor@@ r@@ ying as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; which would make a step@@ ford wife progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties , which are attra@@ cting , such as sh@@ immer@@ ing .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ Robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of school@@ ing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; war@@ ms the Website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it also has its m@@ oods over the day - just like real people !
she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this ascent of sex rob@@ otic robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ t@@ ful female properties that go to rape , if one goes one step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah is an un@@ troubled most .
on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , then why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; means it &apos;s on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just another sex toys .
their emergence and increasing sophist@@ ication indicate a little dar@@ ker and deep in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course do not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R indicated their increasing popularity , they remain pro@@ vision@@ ally on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what ri@@ dd@@ led out of the border zones , can be in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very educational .
many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting , until they give the free market to them .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly sophisticated sex robots are threatened in a time , in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House , which has been sum@@ mon@@ ed to have sexual assault .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the swallowed body and the out@@ stretched eyes but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with Por@@ nost@@ ar propor@@ tions ) .
their builder want that they feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to its &quot; person@@ alities &quot; the robots represent no real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
expressed differently : they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the phrases by 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ umps Big Performance ?
he does Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy lives
it has become one of the tr@@ ump of tr@@ ump era that the political divisions have polarized the US voters , even families in the small format .
around Christmas and Than@@ ksgiving , there were newspapers with reviews about how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump chosen relatives .
we all allegedly hur@@ ry up to let our fil@@ ets burst .
less noticed is the power Tr@@ umps , Famili@@ es together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lin@@ qu@@ ered poet who lives in Chicago and has long been living with rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family who visited me this week in New York .
they re@@ minded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone knows them , including the rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , with whom she had fought for decades , suddenly and quite strange at the same side .
in order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it inev@@ it@@ ably comes to me that this brings considerable risks associated with it .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the acting effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that we will no longer meet the cookies of one day .
however , there is still a sc@@ ary long @-@ term scenario where Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; that suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of pois@@ oning suddenly in comparison to its standards .
I think today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ ari@@ ous version of the decline - the dog at the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which knew 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in fact , compared to tr@@ ump in fact occur to a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify for an un@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ ou@@ sel of the New York City department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enorm@@ ously big , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ ed and the animals turn to look at full fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the fierce music convey@@ s this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city becomes not just the dream .
five @-@ five years later , and I am still not throughout the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss cottage doesn &apos;t count - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience since here two @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked him .
on the other hand , during this week , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to pay rating with a 15 % tip money - this is to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to initi@@ ate personality in a situation , in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store has ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from the prison to the hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
in the past year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ suffered from his wrist@@ s to the hospital , according to a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after an appeal against the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet drain in his house in Pre@@ toria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night int@@ ru@@ der who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their purpose , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say that they would be consider@@ ate .
the National Criminal Code , said that she would raise the appeal by the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .

as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the districts were held from F@@ us@@ el@@ hofen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen for holidays and to the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to college , four at the secondary school .
school manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental Citi@@ zens House in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen , Germany .
29 pupils from the four classes took place under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des who grows a young eagle , who is growing in the poultry farm , but then release freedom .
the m@@ lower sh@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and made it brood from his chicken .
a small eagle came out instead of a chicken k@@ ens .
but the hope of it came out of him to make a chicken , the eagle grew up and sli@@ pped on a high mountain at a high mountain .
after that , the classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ads , the cylinders wore to the bet .
the eagle stand for integration , MEP Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young might be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wanted to wish any tri@@ vial , that he feels himself in his new school .
we followed Dank@@ es@@ wort to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who once again jumps when she arrives at the school and her parents .
the kitchen was now over , the class teacher Sophia Schumacher declared .
they leave their pup@@ il after two years of lessons only very unbelie@@ v@@ ably because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the quadru@@ ped .
to conclude , all students heard a song from summer time and holiday time .
the children struck great joy during the children .
eight initial de@@ gl@@ ers are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for Il@@ legal Camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally camp people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians had been released later .
the Greek authorities have shar@@ pen@@ ed the control over the free camp and place each one who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , significant cash stra@@ ins .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the operators have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group software updates have offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emissions behaviour of the emissions of the emissions in Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anine by ACE Auto Club Europe are assess@@ ing :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the released software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have che@@ ering software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin .
the retro@@ fitting provided by the Federal Chancell@@ ery ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but not yet called a precise date .
Daimler has communicated to writing every person .
if anyway an inspection is due , it will be done in their frame .
how long will the equipment be drawn up altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anine says .
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , the car manufacturer did not approach the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming might be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE will advis@@ es you to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would im@@ itate , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where passengers can thre@@ aten .
there are no impair@@ ments for older diesel in rural areas so far .
the Ace goes to wait with a sale yet .
ill Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets as the first R@@ apper one of the prestigious awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural device announced on Thursday , singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , and the chore@@ ograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) belong to this year .
handed over the awards early December .
traditional American President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a welcome and join Mel@@ ania on the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the progressive TV series announced by the L@@ ear Foundation announced that it is already announced to attend the Gala to participate in the Gala .
&quot; the New York Times , &quot; he said , &quot; This presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ li@@ ze the arts and human rights - even the means of escap@@ ing - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan emphas@@ ized that I will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clear their view .
the Kennedy @-@ Centre , named after the former president , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
among the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city vital
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente in the coming year .
the site is already written - but the applic@@ ant is rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been working for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press interview .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks , waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , so far no application is to fill the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next time .
so - under respec@@ ting the regular term of regular term - still enough time for an elab@@ oration .
since Has@@ lach acts for the administration community as an under@@ e building authority , the applic@@ ant must counter@@ point the applic@@ ant .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if you don &apos;t have to fill it out , the citizens would have to take care of assistance up to Off@@ enburg .
but the city is very important to the city and himself , W@@ acker , who reported by a good operating climate , as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
over 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , to the w@@ acker proudly looks back with pride .
&quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; he is sure about the building &apos;s office and staff .
varied projects are also present in the future : the re@@ shaping of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Dut@@ ho@@ bic area around are stim@@ ulated .
the cinem@@ atic bridge between Bol@@ l@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium restoration is still subject .
the latter alone will be@@ ech some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is present for a municipal master builder .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own building yard and gar@@ dening can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted by many thanks .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .
since the old@@ town as a ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have an eye on what pur@@ i@@ fies &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ izes the separ@@ ator &apos;s master builder .
anyway , the city master carries great responsibility .
he is a builder , &quot; at the end everything is going through my table . &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years now , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years .
also , his successor will be long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and wants to stay with the place . &quot;
for continuity is not only important to a good company , but also for the further design of the city .
who would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker should be able to study a university engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree program in the fields of construction and building planning .
the municipal office stand high @-@ tech and deep @-@ building , construction planning , bur@@ under@@ lining chairs , administration of urban Property , municipal farm with building yard and municipal property , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : south railway line locked
according to the police , the unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway line in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ atic Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
they were so badly damaged that the susp@@ ending goods had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male offen@@ ders and seek them for the night of night .
near the crime scene a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bicycle @-@ driver had been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz coup , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A .
the perpet@@ rators have brought himself into great danger and also at risk to train .
in addition to the damage at the locomotive and the facility , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the costs for the rail @-@ up traffic could even come to P@@ ön@@ alen &apos;s clients .
in total , a considerable sum of &quot; considerable sum , the speaker said .
the damage were again fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway was led without disability .
nearly ten people were retired Friday morning , two of them entered the correspondence .
freight trains were not falling , but they were delayed .
according to the Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged for about 200 meters of overhead lines .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate might help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammation
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digest@@ ive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases could alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the U.S. and in Great Britain 300,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amps and bl@@ ings , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the parties usually get advised to relie@@ ve flesh and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins , found to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolled in the intest@@ ine to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food , do not in@@ filtr@@ ate in the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues .
if equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments he found that a kind of tolerance of the immune cell cell in mice was demonstrated that a particular bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates carry .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus cer@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ om , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an are toler@@ ant , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ ther@@ us , if the same system performs with people .
the Post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investig@@ ating a kind of imm@@ unity when it found out that a group of study regim@@ es had such cells , but a different group of the same stem , but that had not been separated .
it thought that the difference with the gut micro@@ bi@@ ds of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
mice were sequ@@ enced to DNA sequ@@ enz@@ es and were found in six bacterial species , which were present in mice with immune cells , but without being missing in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed a gut micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria accum@@ ulate on the immune system , the researchers ate L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then brought small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ate cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism , which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the food of mice , the number of such cells decreased by around 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ top@@ han@@ aten was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ toler@@ ating cells like mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i are developing the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to fo@@ ster , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potential can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an expansion of this population . &quot;

however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia @-@ tour of the blues , and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .

the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State , drawing in Marqu@@ ette but in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner about the USA , that &apos;s several thousand kilometres .

new proposal for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still rotating , looked up social and minist@@ erial presi@@ dents always with some concern to Berlin .
only no stor@@ y@@ fire from the party central , merely no head@@ wind from the covenant - so was the most important wish of the election champion .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed .
since then , the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House also watch the events in the SPD @-@ regulated state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has been given from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were deep attacks .
and indeed one by another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority of Lower Saxony , the German Federal CDU see a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CDU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising quest@@ ionnaire by a Green M@@ EPs has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the daily election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ President , Michael wa@@ iter , has invited people to return to El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to return their mandate .
the crossing of the CDU means a clear dist@@ ortion of the voters .
El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the federal managing director and election campaign of the Green Editor Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands after the crossing of the Green M@@ v@@ ests of El@@ ke T@@ west until the CDU without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the mis@@ c began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , nothing more , re@@ ass@@ uring the comra@@ des s@@ wir@@ y .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that became well - and indeed everything was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the do@@ cking , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite cut the party smoothly .
lab@@ ori@@ ously the comra@@ des ra@@ ged down in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had created new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and the next blow came with him .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD polit@@ ician , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he was seated in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burned .
and because he did not make anything wrong in the crisis communication , doing what you can make wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival .
so now Stephan Weil .
because of the Volkswagen exhaust and his role in the supervisory board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ thy re@@ question@@ ed values were added .
anyway , or maybe , because in the past few weeks , Weil wanted to get stronger in the covenant of acc@@ ents in the past few weeks .
the ende@@ av@@ ours of the former Mayor of Hanover , to build its power in Berlin , was also not hidden in the category of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him , as they spoke of Weil a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
because there is no guilt in the Party of the Lower Saxony , because there is no fault in this party .
and Schulz was not at all .
sometimes , comra@@ des strive every effort to hold their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the slo@@ ping par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ west .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ fty , like woman T@@ ests , her own career entry on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party left in the SPD parliament , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
woman T@@ west is not elected as a direct @-@ channel , but on the state list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party , so the de@@ acon of Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties further .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ tor@@ ch was clear four years ago : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the personal reflection of a future CDU MPs f@@ uses the election results , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said .
he called to clear the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there was further additions of the CDU Nieders@@ achsen .
funding for Ort@@ is@@ ers III
who wants to renov@@ ate his home in the years can get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of Ste@@ g Urban Development informed about Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a look back to the so far story .
since 1991 it has been working in Emp@@ fingen san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Wu@@ er@@ ttemberg has acquired two thirds of the funding amount .
the income amounted to 60 percent in the rehabilitation region II from 2005 to 2016 .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous refurb@@ ishments are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote the inner development and not only to develop new buildings .
on April 4 , the Government of the Government of Karlsruhe will receive the information that there will be a renovation area III .
the amount will amount to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros would be from the country , the rest of the village .
how is a rehabilitation area now ?
one will continue to examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned territory is at all interest , to san@@ ge .
if necessary , the area borders may be moving again .
the ste@@ g spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; Social Town , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out .
core of the program are the re@@ loc@@ alization of the inner city , improving the living and working conditions and the infrastructure and expansion .
the measures were more object @-@ related , which is called per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be fixed as a stat@@ ute .
the funding period for the funding period runs until 1 January 2017 or 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the stock capacity would only be carried out as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a quest@@ ionnaire .
as anticipated , in November or December , the amend@@ ment will take place in order to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann disc@@ ern@@ ing that each Commun@@ e had carried out the pre @-@ resear@@ ches .
it is about jud@@ ging and decide the urban si@@ dents and decide when san@@ ction is and in what extent .
the plot is then also included in the basic book for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come again to Emp@@ fingen and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed a major success factor for the project be the participation of those involved .
therefore , there will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks , and be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow quest@@ ionnaire is the &quot; building and boundary relationship , &quot; in which it works for structural condition and refurb@@ ishment .
in the grey quest@@ ionnaire , the &quot; fiscal and housing &quot; , data may be made to size , divi@@ ding and residents of a living space .
the blue &quot; Operation bogen &quot; can be filled only if there are business premises in the building .
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a fill quest@@ ionnaire is not at the same time a request for convey@@ ing agents is not at the same time .
new construction measures are also not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of convey@@ ing agents after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ hound principle &quot; function@@ ally - who first comes , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
you can &apos;t reserve any support fee later . &quot;
at the end there were photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; in order to make a restoration of a restoration . &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand @-@ movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his front door , entering his office and even start his car with a movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is performed according to medical standard .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars , that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one now has both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the promotional fees of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn , which raises the American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost up to $ 24@@ ,000 US dollars according to the military service provided by the TIM@@ E magazine .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Head of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited beside a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the Military Bureau of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn , after the recordings of the Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , who is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you are aware of it because it &apos;s an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event its superior , the Deputy nav@@ al man@@ de@@ ur for aviation .
the report showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn at 7 : 00 in the morning at the South La@@ wn , and so long , until the grass was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note adds that if your departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would need a second squ@@ ad due to the restriction of the service hours .
the original flight indication was during the event during the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the plane .
recordings provided by the TIM@@ E was not clear , however , if a second flight crew was required .
the Hatch Act forbi@@ ds federal government to use government ownership for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm the determination .
&quot; a question that we exhibited was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander answered .
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a violation for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to increase government regulations .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
President is obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use just for a photo procedure is obvious , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February , as the Presi@@ dential plane in front of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the Presi@@ dential plane by its predec@@ ess@@ ors .
&quot; the White House is enth@@ r@@ alled by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said vice director of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training flights to Washington and South La@@ wn in order to impos@@ e US President at the White House with more precise Zen@@ timet@@ ables .
as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted during the training requirement for the month , said an official .
in addition 11 hours of this day Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flo@@ ats for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were not taking the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a speaker by S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company would not have been involved to put a helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintain bud@@ get@@ ary records for the Presi@@ dential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight lesson .
records of the unit recorded flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; to determine the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of accounting estimates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the rates for Do@@ D does not include staff costs , but consider costs for fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former press pre@@ cher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are manufactured in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think , as most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is , of course , adequ@@ ately emphas@@ ized that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with the helicopter inter@@ ag@@ ated when he entered his tour over South La@@ wn by the South La@@ wn , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
at the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and over@@ threw the media over his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
the top leader of the Second Tennis League comes with the Tab@@ ulated Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel in the Tab@@ ulated Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite the five games still mak@@ es@@ os@@ er balance , the leader of the second tennis league has won the sense of reality .
team chief Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
just on the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ ch dor@@ fer , we care mainly the imports from the far north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to inserts in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Go@@ r@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it becomes difficult for us as always .
you also need a good dose of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give maxim@@ e jan@@ four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo ended yesterday with the White @-@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
but it should be in Kiel but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ el@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and Belgium &apos;s Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again put into the team .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , don &apos;t fill someone out of the coach at Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t work when he sat on Wednesday evening his signature by the law for the deep@@ ening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his h@@ ast to adopt the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was also sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed for the US push .
after all , the design sees to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build G@@ asp@@ ip@@ el@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors of the native O@@ MV are concerned , which co @-@ financed with other European firms , the construction of the Russian Baltic coast Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ y@@ cul@@ pture is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of consequences , such as the official statement of oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions by Executive Order .
he has twelve weapons with him .
&quot; the press &quot; has been viewed , which could defend the Group and which could really hurt him .
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is located in the Hit@@ row of Net@@ fli@@ x in the center of the Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer is unveiled , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not yet been over .
the Staff@@ les three and four have already been confirmed by streaming service , the first trailer was given its first trailer and showed the newest bu@@ cks of the show .
with its third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kartell .

roll backwards : the city establ@@ ishes 46 kitchen staff
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch@@ time again .
with firm response partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
the watch is shot in the urban day@@ care centres .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the dining area in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) back into self @-@ regulated .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Youth Aid , this is a good news : &quot; we are all very glad . &quot;
cooked will continue to leave the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh boiled .
the city runs in the area of 46 children &apos;s day , in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kit@@ ten year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need constantly grows .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 weekly hours in the K@@ ita , explained Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 Parti@@ al forces have heating the delivered food from 1st September ; they prepare the delivered food , add salad , raw foods and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give meals from , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workers are assigned firmly to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as military units - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now qualified to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; so , they are much stronger and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot;
for this reason it works : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power of the team would be useful .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as the task of the kitchen staff - will be settled by the Special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen equipment , also has the charm , which it expressed itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ rule and foreign distribut@@ ors to the city as the most economic ones , is called the press office .
and this , although 46 partial forces are employed .
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people at the education field not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .

G@@ MB @-@ concern on investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union wishes to wi@@ pe at managers of Bis@@ c@@ ite @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long @-@ term commitment to production at its work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had s@@ silent about the future of investment in the Tol@@ l@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work that manufactures any other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ ins said he invested more than 5 million pound in recent years .
he added that the staff and trade representatives were &quot; first experienced &quot; when their activities would change .
in a letter to the company branches of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; said that the financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines is not prop@@ elled . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the needs of Tol@@ l@@ cross &apos;s business needs and investment plans for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross .
generations of families have worked here and working forces focus strongly on the local community and the bulk of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in front of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently has a thri@@ ving presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokesperson on plaque said : &quot; the Fili@@ al@@ iter in Tol@@ l@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to the company as we appreciate the ongoing commitment in employees and trade union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Tol@@ l@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tol@@ l@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , the PS@@ G Barcelona has warned against Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La Liga like her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
Paris Saint @-@ Germain does not release n@@ ym@@ ar in its persecution by £ 189 million in order to resolve an offer of £ 189 million , but they have warned Spain three years ago in front of the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach he@@ ats the transit window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , and Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season .
after the termination , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the most affordable professional sport@@ s@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way to outside although a fountain has always given its best to the Catal@@ ans , although the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world three years ago warned by the PS@@ G president before this prosp@@ ect ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign the best player of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign up one of our players at yourself , this will have consequences . &quot;
this line seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club pressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that it could not allow the International from Italy to leave any circumstances under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing any of its price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .
sco@@ oter is thrown and damaged
on Saturday night from Friday to Saturday a well @-@ known perpet@@ rator has deliber@@ ately thrown into the Königs@@ felder road before the property number 30 , and so on the cl@@ adding of the vehicle would damage more than 200 euros .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report kid@@ ding Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report about the abuse of abuse was made by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report to the failure sc@@ andal at the Um@@ bre@@ lla Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ing , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication of the German press Agency , he ob@@ servatory from former Regen@@ sburg Bishop and today &apos;s card@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Emer@@ itus Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the pre@@ stige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have expressed deep regret about their own under@@ tak@@ ings or their then false estim@@ ation of processes .
the Vatican courts &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; however , critic@@ ized that in the reporting on violence with &quot; two measures &quot; should be measured .
nobody knows no one of the attacks in Regensburg , that it would have to be punished by &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; the acc@@ ust@@ ness , the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal for normal &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
even Für@@ st@@ in Gloria by Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we &apos;re looking forward to the church and that is a well @-@ known fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; blo@@ ws a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical remedy . &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who covered the mem@@ oir &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ esh@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which was submitted to the author of the dioc@@ ese of Ulrich Weber with the declaration of education ?
a total of 5@@ 47 rainy s@@ spar@@ ks were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ ot@@ ism &quot; victim of attacks , 67 domain names sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. , in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
even with high Emot@@ ions the punishment for the students could also be more severe .
in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , however , many victims estimates the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore even positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
in the interview E@@ zek@@ emann , why the final report about the abuse of the Um@@ bre@@ lla Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger would be reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 pages report about the &quot; Incidents of violent ins@@ ulators in the Um@@ wel@@ sh Dom@@ sp@@ lash &quot; gives a contra@@ dict@@ ory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one , many students raise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
to the other , it also appears as ch@@ ol@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was not a top performance musi@@ cally without any top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his biograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself more about why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is coming in it at all .
he is dedicated to him just eight sides and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of the Mitt@@ al or co @-@ slavery in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the acts of violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of its sphere .
one can c@@ alle@@ vi@@ ate him if too late or have taken first proposals to have taken seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; qualified &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high Emot@@ ions , which also lead to twi@@ ut@@ ches .
that he threw himself not only with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the ground , but also ear@@ marked guys from the hair or ears , he himself has already off@@ ended years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
however , it has to be said that such educational methods in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widespread in parents as with teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .
I also experienced that in a sec@@ ular school , state school .
compared to what actually goes in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school , they are certainly b@@ agu@@ as .
you wonder if it &apos;s not to do with his acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , many media have just thrown on him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who never understand him , still eag@@ erly a@@ waited .
but the truth is : the report disc@@ usses Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
the media reports in connection with the report very much about the subject of abuse during the Dom@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ lash .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also any involvement or co @-@ relationship with regard to sexual abuse on load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : definitely no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entru@@ sted to the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or mother , &quot; said an aff@@ ection@@ ate representing the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in education of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even feel parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a ch@@ oral director , who had been a cow@@ or@@ ist of the perpet@@ rators yet .
how do you rate the scratch @-@ pup@@ il R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; in regards sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he would have had timely reviews ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have had the respective off@@ ender .
I think it ... also for truly absurd to accept that itself ... Bu@@ ben ha@@ un@@ ting or clear@@ er or rather re@@ opened as compared to their parents , intern@@ als , confidenti@@ ality teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that we trusted in the ap@@ ron and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
as regards sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is saying free of all participation .
in this way , it cannot be accused of having hin@@ dered him or brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contra@@ dict@@ ory crimes , as unfortunately in some cases .
in the media , a lot of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; had to be read by the Um@@ bre@@ lla Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; Weg@@ ner . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything mixed and dist@@ orted to a huge mil@@ king from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger .
yet exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
then there is clean separate : between the pre@@ school and the grammar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and acts of violence as well as we say , we will once more .
in addition , the report inci@@ dents have been treated from time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral leader of the Dom@@ sp@@ lash .
the whole dre@@ ad@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers have been scre@@ ened and painted , all at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have dominion .
but with them Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they had already been on the domain name .
on that was how the most important witnesses were bet@@ ting , the subject &quot; pre@@ school &quot; t@@ abo@@ o .
one was just happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; para@@ dig@@ an &quot; states .
what was different about the domain registration ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ al violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the end that &quot; many victims estimates the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot;
so it remains at the same time the repro@@ ach to have thrown away .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself just as well and from the predec@@ ess@@ ors at a school , which he did not work and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger van@@ ished with the ears consistently ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the@@ atri@@ um gymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
in it he indicates that in the pre@@ school , he continues to be practiced . &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press release , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was forbidden as a test pun@@ ishments in Bavaria .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , like everyone knows us .
it was difficult for him to see where the suffer@@ ers might be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ at@@ ised , and where the permitted border was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say , he always would have st@@ owed away .
that is simply not right .
only in 1980 , schools was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria .
Für@@ st@@ in Gloria by Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed to be un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of that time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak histor@@ ians at the &quot; Fall@@ out of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger , past according to present moral standards .
the princess is right there .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ om@@ in@@ able to all times , and also not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence to innocent children &apos;s points , that goes far beyond practice .
this is all horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be up .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear to draw and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment would then be forbidden , he also has stri@@ pped himself stri@@ c@@ ingly .
which picture of his rainy day George R@@ atz@@ inger has played with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope . &quot;
came the subject of Prü@@ fer to the language also ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ ct XV@@ I. tells of his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ lash played only a minor role .
however , I don &apos;t want to know that there was a stri@@ c@@ enti@@ onal regim@@ ent there .
but this also has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ sports , true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition , which went equally twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and cand@@ y alone , one does not even make a big singer and stand before each success in which area but ever discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I &apos;ve met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , low @-@ believers and heart@@ ed people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only be able to do something a fly .
I get regular contact with how many former cathedral @-@ atzen still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ gency , visit him regularly - he &apos;s almost blind - and he is almost blind - and like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are so thank@@ ful for him that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always was a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a strict father that may be - but also a lovely respec@@ t@@ ful person , to which she still looks up and honour her .
and please , once again clearly : all that one throws it , are gu@@ ardi@@ ans of education that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ fair , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin@@ bu@@ ck .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , dischar@@ ged him .
now the insur@@ gency , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who would have acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , perhaps no one would probably know the Regen@@ sburg Dom@@ sp@@ ill , finally , finally in peace .
