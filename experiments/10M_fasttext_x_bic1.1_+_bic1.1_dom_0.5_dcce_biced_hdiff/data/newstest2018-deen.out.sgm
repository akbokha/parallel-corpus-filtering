<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners generate the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows it, who had to be exciting, because the auto-Navi had to show a green meadow instead of a walkway.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Attores, an offer of the Geoport Bavaria of the State government, are everything else but currently very illuminating.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Digital Bayern-Atlas is a splattered carpet, which you can see as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The large coverage map were detailed maps, so-called urine leaves for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bayermination administration, this originated in 1810 and 1864 the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if French troops ended with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the" Topographical Bureau "established the project and thus established the Bayerische Engagement Ring.</seg>
<seg id="19">The extension sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and is to be found like any other on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded and expanded in all directions.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is the sendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">After 21 years after the map, Sendling was created in 1877, in the Munich area of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the sendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses subdusts focus in 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the west park is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: there appears a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten documents from the so-called "primal release" from which the basic tax was derived from.</seg>
<seg id="27">Little plots finish there today no farmers more - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Lower sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the prehistoric sheet, it is read in the area of today's au-Haidhausen in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen, "on the guest house" at the air "or even in big letters" Irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich-Irrenburg district "emerged on the Auer Lünen."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment - of the psychiatrist who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it was advanced for his time and ended the inception of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">He is also forbidden to use the staff to make violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was first room for 280 patients, and later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisky Institute in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the premises of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Munesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted him to a youth center with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">The soccer field of the TSV Munich Ost, East residential houses dating from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architecturally based on the original building of the Irrenstrasse, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was the first place in 1856 as the "main square," which was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War was also a decisive change in the heart of Münch.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the bombs of the Allied forces seized many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business buildings and a tomb stone from the Middle Ages were once on the Marienhof, where the days work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich-card can be compared with the shooting gallery of today - and fill the hole on the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of dyes found a warning for coloured people who travel due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, which will come into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents that occur last time in the whole country," says it in the position of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent approved law of Missouri, which makes people harder to win discrimination, as well as the investigative authorities of the state who disproportionate the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of the civil rights, people will happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted because of their skin color, they will unite, or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we listen to complaints in such a frequency which we haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group noted incidents such as racist publishers at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances beginning of the year, after having no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of Missouri office, which is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees informed about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be prepared whether you bring cheering money or relatives know they are travelling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 Hassverts in 2015, according to the latest numbers from the FBI, based on the number of such injuries on the number of such injuries on the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to complain for employment or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration authorities agreed to suspend people due to immigration flows, which will contribute to the view of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent years, stakeholders has implemented the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Female fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestagsarized Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the fisheries CDU-town association together with Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the excavation yard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">At first, Markus Schwendemann bestows insights into its operation, in which he farms 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and as many young are accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest" is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows, like Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of holiday guests comes exclusively Regular.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also called the BLHV-chairman of the fishing village, he called "elemental project as" elemental. "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area is a lot of work, a lot of work with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been struggling with the terms and topography," says Tildemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the operation and used it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the Commune has been recognized the importance of the feminine project and is glad about the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the surfaces of the land could still be drawn up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and thinking about how they continue their farm," emphasised the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 parcels were fenced off over the course of women in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be stopped up until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euros, half of leader was promoted, a quarter contributed to the fishing village of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers stay in 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weiden.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and landlords it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">For Peter White, too: "here the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The State Library of Agriculture (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state subsidy of pasture.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR generated funding sources is a precondition.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area must not be sluctable (Hanging over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application for the fisherman Weidezvaunproject 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area is 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans appreciate these as well as any other, therefore the sorrel-staged downfall Saddam Hussein's place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a hitchy dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the proposals for the drastic limitation of the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A Horde of boaters and Liberty-Imitators would have suffered him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it was on their meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to which was added later, and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively right, but as he formulated it, doesn't really go about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not committed themselves in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who tried to place their words after their death on the base, knew very well that they have accomplished a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republican, in an isolated classic image showing the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a quite different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change it for a long time from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big screaming Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not to invite anyone but rather an early Neocative condoms that the American flame would bring into the controversial world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">She shall bear the torches of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine through the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual, Limligh is something unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus insisted to see them as they were seen by the exhaustion, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys to the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the true sense of seeing the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue said to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine through the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black gets Scottish members of the team from Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two shallets belonged to the team of Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">The power director of athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of world championship cruises will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "Scotland has developed something special in Scotland," and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we will try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics Men: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the crew to the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought completely natural, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, which will compete with their fifth world championships in the 400-m hurdles, says it "incredible," that 16 shallots in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">The best total number of athletes at the World Championship were seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">In the past year, the mid-haust runner Muir leads five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">You will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another cave that was included after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first world championships, when the only other band was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The man capitals says it "enormously proud" on the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team but in some cases also at the medals and in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special part of the team capitals to be, is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and voted for something completely special for me," added them.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to Podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on these home support and benefit that we are back to the Olympiastadion Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="159">I will get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of criticises on Facebook: do not beware by a public ministry, if you cannot tolerate voters from voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last until the newspapers stroke him because of all, from the indoor policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He chimped with criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For the year 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of freedom can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we are led to battles like sheep."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work on it to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him about this very beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governors of the governor canceled the complaint as temporary, and the online commentary was full of a counterpart with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to reconnect with his voters and made his haired head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the Governors "side - which is a public forum, which is regarded as officially and will be paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Mr. Amelia Chasse defended the actions of governors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of Trollen or spammers or water-filled people who vibrate online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profited.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not cashilled, but she asked to break after hate.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I am sorry that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hassverge and other current news," wrote them in the commentary area of the message "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea when a number of people takes on the same subject, then they are considered as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the workers of governors have referred to as "concentrated spam attack" would others probably call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical ladders and to burn or demonstrators to silence and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public public, who is criticized for this purpose that he implies Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County expired the First Amendment, according to the US District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she was a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit to the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portraits had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mail letters beat on his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used Pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all the letters of newspapers who made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping of Britain by the United States, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of freedom, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true tour means to accept that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club</seg>

<seg id="257">"no one ventures to get around after 17 o'clock in the village," she says.</seg>
<seg id="258">It is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hochland von Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1.026 elders had to vote in the occupying forces.</seg>
<seg id="259">An existing movement, which touched for independence from the Dutch rule, turned back to the government of Jakarta who maintains control of the region and exclude foreign journalists or legal watches.</seg>

<seg id="269">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia Goldland.</seg>
<seg id="271">The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a plateau of New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="274">However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's most powerful military keeps the eternal presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">A study conducted by 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 of almost 20 million US dollars, including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims since each week incidents," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia Explorer for Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="282">The bolts have intensified, as papuas resources carry a influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="283">The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes because Muslim business immigrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.</seg>

<seg id="290">But in Papua less changed, and now the locals feel betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="291">"our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokovi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored," says You.</seg>
<seg id="292">In fact, Paniai sled only two months after Jokowis's inauguration in October.</seg>
<seg id="293">On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas carols before a campfire in Enarotali, when two indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness.</seg>
<seg id="294">They told them that they should turn on their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="295">One of the soldiers took an impulse to her tone and later came back with four soldiers, the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="296">The soldiers, who had drunk, pursued and beat the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="298">A child who was 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, became so hard hit that he fell into a coma.</seg>
<seg id="299">A few hours later, the building was set in a fire near the nearby government commission.</seg>
<seg id="300">About 1,000 young papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="301">They wore a ceremonial hunting ground and carried out the Waita dance - in the circle and caused a bird-gesang - from Papuas Mee Pago-tribe.</seg>
<seg id="302">Some demonstrators began to slash stones on police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">When the mood heats up, the soldiers were sent over an internal radio: "if the masses were able to resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," means it was not released in an official document of TIME which has not been released to local media.</seg>
<seg id="304">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto-Forttels of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.</seg>
<seg id="305">Nobody was listening to the mood.</seg>
<seg id="306">"when I turned around me, I got stuck in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colourful wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="307">Kayame still does not know who has fired, but says that the bullet came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.</seg>
<seg id="308">"it was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="309">The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, the witness of encourages.</seg>
<seg id="310">"I ran to him, and examined his body to be sure that he was it," said Yohanes, who just bears a name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.</seg>
<seg id="311">"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."</seg>
<seg id="312">The chief reactor of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted to "secure their station," because they would be attacked.</seg>
<seg id="313">"we must defend ourselves if people threatens to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua police, Inspector Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="314">"it is about life and death."</seg>
<seg id="315">According to Human Rights Watch five young demonstrators were killed and many more violated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The news about the killings came first on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">In three weeks, Jokovi kept a passionate speech in which he voiced sympathies for the families of the victims and swore to go to the historical appellings in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.</seg>
<seg id="319">Security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will establish an extrajudicial mechanism for the laying of historical human rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="320">But the excuses began almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="321">"most injuries occurred in a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="322">Some were in the 90's and early 2000 years.</seg>
<seg id="323">The point is that we have committed to walk these violations, but there are processes that must go through, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="324">Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke in Jakarta in Jakarta with TIME and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="325">Instead, "everything is legally regulated." he said.</seg>
<seg id="326">Wiranto, who had accused the UN for "Crime against humanity" with more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody crimes of independence from 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights abbreaches in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai advance.</seg>
<seg id="327">Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with fierce anger.</seg>
<seg id="328">"I was interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress," Yohanes says.</seg>
<seg id="329">"I am tired."</seg>
<seg id="330">He says that he still lives in fear for years.</seg>
<seg id="331">"I'm afraid," he says.</seg>
<seg id="332">"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="333">His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.</seg>
<seg id="334">He says he was beaten by the military, after he helped to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="335">"after I had buried the corpses, the military sought me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="336">The shotics have not ceased.</seg>
<seg id="337">On Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.</seg>
<seg id="338">During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a Baufirma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.</seg>
<seg id="339">The man, the 24-year-old raviolanus Douw, drowned when he drowned in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="340">Upgrades of the company were protesting in front of the company's location.</seg>
<seg id="341">The police said that the villagers put stones on officers who reacted by warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="342">But locals say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one.</seg>
<seg id="343">"we were so in panic, we have fear that it will give revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness, as the injured one was delivered quickly, so the TIME.</seg>
<seg id="344">"I have hidden two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai parliament invoked the officers to withdraw the officers and withdraw the police in the area.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always a place for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">Lack of sensual development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the ancestors of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green Highlands of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many joined the Free Papua movement "(OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by moving sporadic attacks and kidnappings of indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, among them Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yuden Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody, under the pretext of "securing the national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never wake up again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as far reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build all that they eat: mainly Nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women, each with four or five fields of sweet potatoes.</seg>
<seg id="358">They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota costly only 10,000 indonesian rupees (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have since opened new flight grooves to Nabire airport in greater numbers.</seg>
<seg id="361">The few workplaces that exist in the region, usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely have capital or necessary skills to make their own company competitive.</seg>
<seg id="363">"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the Chairman of the Paniai tribe.</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">In addition, there remain evidence of international media coverage.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudas and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission was given to film.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokovis campaign were to raise the limitations of coverage to increase transparency and development, not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's unpeaceful provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshallinese Islands - the UN Human Rights Council - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai slate.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically been supported by the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations from the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media so it is difficult to stop the evidence of human rights attacks."</seg>
<seg id="373">People on site want that more foreign governments have to know this.</seg>
<seg id="374">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human right-ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura attended their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source that also participated in the session but remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="375">Indonesia, 2019, had a further presidential election but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokovi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai-shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribe council.</seg>
<seg id="377">He wants to know that Jokovi knows that the Paniai people, apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a peasant military, is located in poor farming and health services.</seg>
<seg id="378">Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider her voice for Jokowi as an "guilt," which he has to repay.</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they want only justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="380">Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai-Schussers conducted a last symbolic act of faith: the body of an victim was buried on a terrain in front of the police and the military station.</seg>
<seg id="381">They may never know that they may never give justice to them, but at least they don't forget the leaders of their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="382">"a member of our family was killed," says Yacobus, head-in head.</seg>
<seg id="383">"what else can we do?"</seg>
<seg id="384">Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscrapers from Dubai to the second time</seg>

<seg id="390">Dubais, civil protection authorities said that the units of fire-fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time (00.00 o GMT) lost the fire and cool the building.</seg>
<seg id="391">The government said, working on the provision of accommodations for those affected.</seg>
<seg id="392">The incident may have questions concerning the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.</seg>
<seg id="393">A study conducted by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the most important part of the damage was made from cladding, outer cladding to decoration or insulation.</seg>
<seg id="394">In Great Britain, the police told them that the system of plates for insulation and cladding to the London Grenoble Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a sector in which around 80 people died.</seg>

<seg id="399">63.54 percent of the member countries voted for reform, the aim of the ITF President David Haggerty, therefore only scarcely missed.</seg>

<seg id="402">We will continue to work to improve the application.</seg>
<seg id="403">Not only for the vote, after many claims, the finals had come to a neutral place.</seg>
<seg id="404">New from 2018 will be comparatively smaller details: thus the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will soon have the host rights in the following round.</seg>
<seg id="405">In order to reduce the cost of organisers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be made easier and the players will need to complete the new media calendar before the Davis Cup.</seg>
<seg id="406">More than 1 of 5 US-travelers forbidden objects into the airplane, find a survey</seg>
<seg id="407">A survey among flipassers showed that more than 20 percent aware or unconsciously forbidden objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security administration are smuggle, including at least 6 per cent, which carry out the plane while accidentally forbidden knives or other items with blades.</seg>
<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed they had been delayed, that they were wandering with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet Charterservice, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., was also noted that younger travellers were more used to abject the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents, the encores that they were trying to fly with something that was banned from TSA, were 19.7 percent Millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common objects that were deliberately towed to TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent of these reported objects with blades caused by security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have also confirmed that they had been deliberately banned drugs into the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said that it questioned travelers in the whole country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling ware by the airport security and how many things had done intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who are most often smuggled in smuggling - by security, those who were most frequently flying.</seg>
<seg id="415">However, the company indicates that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often uncertain, which liquids can bring them to or how much of them.</seg>
<seg id="417">So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids forbidden by the TSA are forbidden liquids.</seg>

<seg id="423">Next to the always triumphant numbers on sales increase and even more huge target target, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has betrayed another, less glorious number: the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In the past few months, Musk had applied more than 500,000 reservation for the new car, whose delivery will start.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk clears: of the total 518,000 cavities, 63.000 had been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics always pointed out, that it is merely a non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (US $1000 in the US and 1000 pounds) "reservation request" completely back.</seg>
<seg id="428">According to this, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are currently available in a telephone conference with Analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, that the cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders might be the problem, however, the Tesla head does not believe.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production site.</seg>
<seg id="431">Tesla has supplied 84,000 vehicles last year.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018 it will be - all models - 500,000 will be one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently under reservations.</seg>

<seg id="451">"we do not believe in regulation by courts, and we take Fristen seriously.</seg>
<seg id="452">We also accept the law and authority, which gives us serious. "</seg>
<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA said that Pruitt asks his "authority to delay and all other legally available" authority "to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in the Congress are pushing for a more extensive new constitution of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill in the last month of the bill must delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure has not been made in the Senate yet.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York General Prosecutor, Eric Schneiderman, who had accused the coalition of the United States who accused the EPA in this week, said the Group to uphold the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the reversal of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers, which are directly affected by the smog," said Schneiderman. "</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumour celebrates 750 years of St. Hildenarius church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years St. Hildenarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche at the old cemetery-Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th, at 4.30 am invited to a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilary complex a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can enchant you from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">Salvation and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors for their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini highlights: "it is a unique village."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. HilariusChapel was mentioned in documents for the first time in the commemortionable parish church of Tumour, including the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark of silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the charter according to the charter, a magnificent farm, from which the church or the patron saint belonged to the church or the patron saint, was not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the subdorf and the Oberdorf, which today is still visible in the centre of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the third, the main settlement of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around the year 1600 undergo these historical realities.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patron was created from the early medieval town church.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, stowed him with a priest, remained with the owner of this church, and could also inherit the church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was the right to insert a pastor, or to propose a new pastor.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two crumbles on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly constructed bell then took place for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during World War II in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows of the window were staked and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were in the vicinity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hiller's cemetery served as the last resting-place for the dead.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower could be left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of 1834 a storm fell by the steeple and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent evil, the tower was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-value today remained as a witness to the 750 year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem accompanied by the "Schaffhausen pensioners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As an organizer invite friends and supporters of Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Shortly after the opening of Hartmut Romann the final word speaks.</seg>
<seg id="497">The programme starts at 16.30.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">To end of the serenade, a trunk is held in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest," the organisers put out the fantastic view.</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilary facility, which is of significance for tumours and hearing loss.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumlingens are particularly committed to the home hygiene, as Serenade Organisator Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>
<seg id="504">Club wants to check the permission of windsurfing</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim woes" does not see any legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned towards the councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">The "Boisheim" Association fights "Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU), to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen only a wind force concentration zone have existed at the time in Viersen.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines is fundamentally possible, but the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones should prevent "deepening" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">Although a few days ago, the town had decided to change a second windpower concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, but the Düsseldorf District Government did not approve any case, due to a form.</seg>
<seg id="512">"by the lack of planned legal requirement, the approval approvals is still unlawful and therefore diminished," said Christopher Columbus, president of "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of things: the city council decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an permission of the county government is still standing.</seg>
<seg id="514">Colt: "thus the issuance of a approval for the creation of wind energy plants is excluded."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the call.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letter has been received by circle Alsen since last week," said a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them for the occasion to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With a view on the administrative department at the Administrative Court, the circle didn't want to express itself in relation to the argument of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer Nette construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company had participated in which the city was involved in four times, lease agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households, which corresponds to around one-fifth of the electricity requirement of all four households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer there was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Linnich at Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg at the Heinberg district.</seg>

<seg id="564">Transcripts from phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="565">On January 27, Trump asked in a phonat with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, to say openly that he would not pay for a scheduled border wall.</seg>
<seg id="566">The US president implied him because he had publicly refuted the Wall. according to reports he said to him, "You can't tell the press."</seg>

<seg id="571">Moores Ford massacre: activists guide racial Lynchact as a call for justice</seg>
<seg id="572">A 1948-er Ford Mercury was driven by a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and shrink to the Ford Bridge of Moore.</seg>
<seg id="573">Before the car, the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge, a group of white males came out with rifles to block his path.</seg>
<seg id="574">The leader of the bulls - a man of middle ages in a needle-strip - took a long train at its cigar and looking for the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="575">Inside there the occupants were caught in fear.</seg>
<seg id="576">"we want this n ---- r Roger!" roaring the man.</seg>
<seg id="577">Get it from the car! "</seg>
<seg id="578">Crying out the silence, when a young black man was distorted by the passenger seat.</seg>
<seg id="579">Fortunately, this horrible scene, played on 22 July, is just a posture.</seg>
<seg id="580">But if a loop is thrown by the neck of "Roger," almost all of them in the audience was very genuine.</seg>
<seg id="581">Since 2005, Citizenship has returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night, in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - from Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="582">No one was ever indicted for murder.</seg>
<seg id="583">"it's really unimaginable that in all these years, no one person was arrested - although we know who they are," Tyrone Brooks said that helps in the organisation of posture.</seg>
<seg id="584">"it is a dirt spot on a history, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman for Georgia and a life-long civil law.</seg>
<seg id="586">For him, the reproduction as a dramatic call for action serves as a dramatic memory of the Monroe community that a wrong has never been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="587">"we want to confirm the prosecution, we want to be healing, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must receive justice," he said.</seg>
<seg id="588">"we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."</seg>
<seg id="589">A place of jurisdiction is inscribed on the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynch, on 27 July 1946.</seg>
<seg id="590">According to FBI files, which were received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding councils have been suspected of the Lynchprocess.</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one was ever indicted.</seg>
<seg id="592">Although the suspects remain on the free walk for decades, the Civil War that the double motivation for the Lynch actions in the whole city was always known: Politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="593">In April 1946, the Supreme Court adopted a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice to the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="594">At the same time as the election cycle according to the FBI, Roger Malcom became a white basic owner, Barnett Hester, supposedly due to a woman, supposedly due to a woman.</seg>
<seg id="595">Brooks said the rumours in the city was that Hester slept with Malcoms wife Dorothy and that the baby she had, not from her husband.</seg>
<seg id="596">On 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white country owner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, so the FBI.</seg>
<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her Cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.</seg>
<seg id="598">But when they were then removed from prison, the Moore's Ford Bridge approached the car, surrounded by a Lynchmob.</seg>
<seg id="599">"as it turns out, Harrison that has prepared and ordered the murders," includes a FBI report.</seg>
<seg id="600">"it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murder, and has rejected evidence of the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="601">Brooks is formulated it even more concise.</seg>
<seg id="602">"he was a right hand massacre," he said.</seg>
<seg id="603">"they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" if you can register and vote for you, then this will happen. "</seg>
<seg id="604">Cassandra Greene has conducted an annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde for almost a decade.</seg>
<seg id="605">Their portrayal is illustrative, moving, and is based in a kind of deep racism, many believed that he does not exist in America anymore.</seg>
<seg id="606">It is hard to watch, and even more difficult to look, but Greene said that this is the point.</seg>
<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the Lynch, because we will be confronted with the ugliness in all of us," she said.</seg>
<seg id="608">"but I cannot establish a relationship with you, if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through."</seg>
<seg id="609">The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - stuck in a room and lurned when Greene had a well played overview of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is a co-director here.</seg>
<seg id="611">He has played the role of the head-clanet since years, but he said that the role will never become easier.</seg>
<seg id="612">"I feel dirty because I'm not so," said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="613">"but I think it is very important to get this story in life because we don't want to return to that time."</seg>
<seg id="614">On the other side of the room the actor Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, play their lines.</seg>
<seg id="615">The piece starts with Malcom, who screams and urged him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"I said, n --- he, swallow up my property!"</seg>
<seg id="617">Rascona deletes the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then each (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laugh at the loudest point.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," asked Rascona.</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," Greene said, always craving.</seg>
<seg id="625">"I just don't think white people then 'n' n 'have said'.</seg>
<seg id="626">"yet," funny one of the other black actors.</seg>
<seg id="627">"you only have to hit the hard 'R.'.</seg>
<seg id="628">And exactly there the energy in space, a sense of camera body replaces the uneasiness.</seg>
<seg id="629">Everyone is engaged to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene is beginning again.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharp and with imprint.</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition ends violent and fast.</seg>
<seg id="634">There are cry, shots and then silence.</seg>
<seg id="635">A woman clothed with a funeral gown is about the bodies of the actors and leads cheap Holidays song "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="636">Your voice breaks in every second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">About a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people caught perspiration and tears from his eyes.</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is divided almost equally between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">A couple from Ithaca, New York, travelled to see the performance, many come down the street.</seg>
<seg id="640">They have almost eight hours of Georgias supporating moisture, when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you found on the same country, where the Lynch-Morde found, the air feels ghostly.</seg>
<seg id="642">When the last notes of the song sound, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the dead bodies.</seg>
<seg id="643">Children hocks on their heads, record the fake blood and the silent body and whispering each other.</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," murmuring a little boy, as if he would remember.</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes, Greene owes the crowd - and suddenly it is over.</seg>
<seg id="646">The actors throw away the throw away and wipe her tears off.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bradshaw turns Marbaugh, the man in the suit which the Clancher played.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nick Rascona hugged two of his players and then breaks up in her arms, the emotional burdens of the performance ultimately breaks through him.</seg>
<seg id="649">"it is okay," whispers a women.</seg>
<seg id="650">"we know that this is not in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="651">You did that for a reason. "</seg>
<seg id="652">Later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="653">At a table, a white couple hasted from Atlanta, stimulated by a black pair, which they just met.</seg>
<seg id="654">Denise Duplinski therefore struggled to find words which has left the performance.</seg>
<seg id="655">"it's hard to hear these terrible words and actions... from people who look like yourself and what they do, because they look like you," she said.</seg>

<seg id="658">He said he started planning the performance next year.</seg>
<seg id="659">"the posture is inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.</seg>
<seg id="660">"it's like we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of Swedish asylum application tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the reviewed persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the precision of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (Putsunalverket) has started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should be more precise during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish migration authority (Migrationverket), due to errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees, was criticised.</seg>
<seg id="887">Until today, Migrations has shipped 6.880 to testifying cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 testing from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older, while in 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed the person "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be" possibly under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is challenged.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson, by the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent during the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the Local magazine.</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person has been assessed as above 18 years, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has lied over his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that suggest that the investigative person was 18 years or older. "</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet suspects the 581 published results, it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, when X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings are made of knee-joints, which are then criticized by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus des Karolinska-Institute, whose work encompasses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if it used earlier or later than usual by puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">To assess the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">If we cannot say it safely, we should not do as if we could say it, "he said the newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="901">Göransson, from Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of tests: "in general, you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is small.</seg>
<seg id="902">The biggest risk is in this case, if the person is scarce below 18, in this case this is about 10 percent. "</seg>

<seg id="908">The building is earmarked for October and is sure that the schedule is kept.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete which is coated with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4,80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure the stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead across the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, and 10,60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now reached a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so-called fringe cap on Wednesday morning on Wednesday morning.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is an edge punctuation, which is also used as a company road.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the soccer rules of the ball on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent unhindered expenses of European football matches will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spain to French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA still because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules that have been called by the UEFA group in 2011 that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilians from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to over ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make money loose with security, so that Neymar signs and bring it into a galaxy of other stars because of the financing of the team through the energy rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Publishers may apply a lot of money to purchase such a lot of money, but have to help with legitimate deposits, which allow them to break the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit, effectively fraudulent and risked their support when banks or owners have withdrawn their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from its concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - had bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP deposit period, which will run until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to get caught by excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly, FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, across the Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package of package, it can distribute the amount of accounting for the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP's sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, is owned by Manchester City, with most difficult sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars) which later was lowered to €20 million - and it was arranged that the team members will be limited to 21 players in the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to overtake their financial advances by combining their revenue by companies that are connected to owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catarical company might have the PSG sponges if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the default market value, the UEFA will not be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">It was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the figure of the PSA course was taken up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar on payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 could be in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have testified that Neymar World Cup will be eligible for and such a manoeuver for the UEFA regulators can be easily detected.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG means that the UEFA will be more attentive to observe every attempt to circumvent rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a turnover of more than €10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival a blessing for sponsoring Deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new puppet supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey aboard chocolate was produced for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now co-operation is possible in front of a possible end: the airline will write the mission anew.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlp confirmed on request of the news agency SDA an appropriate report by the newspaper "Northern Western Switzerland" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">Following its current planning, the Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">All products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very happy with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Around 17 million small red-white shoggitboards apply to 14 grams per year the flight attendant before landing to the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss no wanted to do any information about the cost.</seg>
<seg id="1167">At 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs, this area of industry estimates estimate an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: for a Schoggia company it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">As many applicants are available in the new tender, the Swiss doesn't want to betray Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers are coming in question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer is not reachable for a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Chocolate bars are distributed on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">The possibility to place the logo, Swiss conducted two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia is in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-90s, for the 90-year-old Grunge-era (as the predenker David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like the time would scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well not only because of his absurd humour (it contained a original story to speak vegetable, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By going to grow on the core of the gags - actors "mean age play horny children who grow up - nonetheless, they made impossibility to win the final part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"Ten Years Later," with his adults who now play adults is less emotional worrying and its parody more after the watering principle of the 90 "s like" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle "(" The hand that shakes the cradle ").</seg>
<seg id="1190">On one point, a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a series of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romautor, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau) still not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity forever.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another mad-vicious plot that is included in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It makes a great deal of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Doom Underlippenbone of "singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old backer.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental delity which could stimulate this franchise such as a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" series, until he achieves what I will show as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon has now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans" to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "Glow" with his East-West ring agony-iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created comedy with Rhys Thomas as a director, a Romanian drama of the eighteen years with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard fleet Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt can be synchronized in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some beautiful Gags to see (the police spends the time trying to watch chess on TV such as Americans may do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offers, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent play 'Finde' voice out.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so very dedicated to truthfulness of a desperate propaganda - a murderer, which carries a Reagan mask, is involved - that it often plays like one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes it draws off, and the comedy is not fast, or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was redesigned on a lower length, might deliver its Agitprop Satire, since Gregor and Iosef has always occupied the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men that swallow a pile of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagery communist audiences is that western culture can do everything to feed a gel.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictive Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and with the ihelites.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Blow against drugs mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police managed a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, in the Black-ald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects have been searched carefully, as the Public Prosecutor's Office of Constance.</seg>
<seg id="1213">There were 15 accused of arrest at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">The officials also presented larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand Euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects, there were German warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of over 300 policemen were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The members of the Mafia is organised drug crimes, violent crimes, attempted murder, as well as robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">During the summer of 2016, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Constance decided against organised drug trafficking in the South German region.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the state communities in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Thus, the major deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.</seg>

<seg id="1231">According to the registers, ten million people with foreign nationality are collected, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Because the data has not been sufficiently well maintained, the data quality has not been well maintained in parts so far.</seg>
<seg id="1234">In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "by people who have long been no longer alive or from citizens, the German citizens, and in the register no longer should appear."</seg>
<seg id="1235">"incorrect data records can considerably slowed back processes," says the report further.</seg>

<seg id="1239">This emerged from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrocker Newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="1240">In the paper therefore, the BAMF means such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since June 1, 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1241">Since the end of 2014, practically no longer possible, the newspaper has been referring to the difficult situation on the spot.</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is likely to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have damped the speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when they hold interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The policymakers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank ended with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates on 0.25%, with less members a rise in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its fourth annual inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7%, and adjusted for 2018 to 1.6%, whereas inflation would likely increase to just under 3% in fall.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But they indicated that in the coming years, interest rates would be necessary to push for inflation and it said that credit costs may be more than expected in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mammut business package, which was published before a year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheap financial resources for banks, although it is expected that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billions of sterling pound sterling.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "in the central prognosis of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as pressure on the reality of households continues to reach consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">In return to interest rates, they repeated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" for cooling down inflation and a "slightly larger" extent would be required than markets expected.</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets currently forecast for the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">However, the Bank stressed that increases "step" and "limits" would occur.</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's downward growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% in comparison to the 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It maintained its growth prognosis to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The Pound fell to this news from the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound was at 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures rate the rising expectations on a interest rate and the GDP has increased to 0.3% in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to recover by 0.3% in the third quarter, even though it is easy to recover after the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1280">The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households, which are affected by a rising inflation and minor payouts, since the vanishing is even worse before it becomes better.</seg>
<seg id="1281">It was added that monetary policy may not stop the income of income, "but it added that the wages are clearly to recover at the end of their three-year cancer."</seg>
<seg id="1282">The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is due to weak pounds, which becomes a part of lower consumer spending.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision is made by a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% in the last August, after the shocking EU voting, which caused the sinking of the Pacon.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the final judgment of the Bank on the interest rates, the call was increased after an interest rate, because inflation increased the pressure on hard-pushed households, whereas three policymakers were demanding to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Inflation was dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the increase in relation to its goal of 2% should be "quite" weak pound. "</seg>
<seg id="1288">Andrew Montier, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "in view of the recent recovery of the swap rate, the mortgage market is likely to be competitive again as the lending business would like to finish in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="1289">The market is particularly well-known for those in which the existing Deals run out and close the new mortgages, and many are becoming more popular with free options and low rates. "</seg>

<seg id="1293">He stated himself to finance the trial, after the Appeals Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year, to pay tribute to the PrEP, in spite of the assertion that local authorities should finance it.</seg>

<seg id="1296">Prepositional phylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before having sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that PrEP reduces the HIV transmission at risk areas at risk of infections.</seg>
<seg id="1298">PrEP before sexual intercourse means to take that enough drug in the body of a person is present in order to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">To those who come in question are gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as antiretroviral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a family physician can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The programme is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs during this week after an international competitive purchase.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne did not bags and sells her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I showed this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she entrusted the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to take advantage of 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlap, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative thinking to solve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together, without leaving us.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not only about designing a simple platform but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled us to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille Lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to leave it longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the reflection is like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units for all seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous noise, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Hinged kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is an apartment door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little of engineering went in," says Erfan of the stahlreinforced, veneered MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so if you slide the door very easily, it is very easy to glide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the cleverless use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"a real estate agent will occur in a rudimentary form and carry out a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they managed to increase the floor space and to use high-quality materials, which provides the room to its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into electrical outlets in walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square count of some standard in something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to leave them.</seg>

<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors of his younger brother Paul. this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation on the separation occurs in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers spent 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre, the areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - von Paul has been described as a "main operator and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's office and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">An area of jurisdiction states that Colin owns property valued at $316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the proposed distribution of Colin proposed distributions, which I kept for the best objects," he wrote in the first monkey in 2015 in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1367">On Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for the control of the existing business - from which Colin, like Paul claims to have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argued, this is not true, but throws Paul in front of managing some owners.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early monkey, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the argument.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage wrote that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants to run the dairy products and delicacy stores from the late 1950-s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the safety to buy the Collingwood property in Colin the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started living in Westco when he was "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hopes to transmit her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Luti Group, whereby Colin says that Mark had paid $10 million for leaving the company $26 million and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Either Luke and Mark, Paul "says about the conditions of their financial separation," says Paul. "</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has kept himself very back, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from Eddie McGuire was the best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took in touch with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can really not say much," because the case was before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it's very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to accuse me and to draw our surname through the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father had not wanted that Paul and I would end in our current dispute," he said, "he said," he was still in a solution. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday these hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts," says Colin.</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trump appointed new Chief of Staff to restrict the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media, hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, on his first working day with leading employee, he set up a major problem in president Donald Trump White House which he would repuff: poor information that come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waiter Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to count Trump by monitor its media management.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relation to television is back for decades now - and now, where he is in the White House, its TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was upset because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places," said the former electoral commission Sam Nunberg in February compared to POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to hold Trumps's Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit has ever been "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe this campaign interprets do something that we do not know others - that trumps tweets have been added to more combustible without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees work it several times, trouble him from him, then their efforts have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevent it that Trump evokes threats.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a White House, which themselves together from competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by promoting trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - dealing with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to bring back the President of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"recent and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuttings, especially those with damaged leaks, and that it gets out to find out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when somebody rejected a printed copy of an article of Gotnew.com, the website of the internet provocation, Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of being at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from Twitter for complicity in Twitter or that he has no specific evidence, or that he expressed false charges in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees on Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold macher added that the former staff of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective Manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his counselors always strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make the Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Mastery Crime received Post of Europol</seg>

<seg id="1428">Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined traveller on a war footed, which are negotiated by the municipality drawn digging in order to reclaim a field before their houses.</seg>
<seg id="1429">The passengers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull, which is called the "millionaire series."</seg>
<seg id="1430">They have brought horses, babies and an army of donors, after they had been kicked out only in May without being deported from one of the buried digging, to prevent their seizures.</seg>
<seg id="1431">The takeful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed its vehicles by a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Indignant inhabitants have taken the advice of Solihull, who said it was "useless" to deal with the problem. "</seg>
<seg id="1433">An anonymous inhabitant said, "They are on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley Heath, where they have placed stones on the passers.</seg>
<seg id="1434">The Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact since it was useless in dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1435">The traveler were there in May, they were moved and are now back again.</seg>
<seg id="1436">More we arrived yesterday evening, probably even more. "</seg>
<seg id="1437">She added: "the Council of Birmingham white how to handle it by long walks in order to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="1438">I am living in the Streetbrook Road and I'm not happy to pay my congregations, if the Council can't stop it once. "</seg>
<seg id="1439">A local resident, who would not be called, said, "It is ridiculous, we just have seen the last round of these traveller, just to be plundered by another round.</seg>
<seg id="1440">The figures have increased this time and even saw a horse in the parking area. "</seg>
<seg id="1441">A spokesperson on the Solihull Council said: "we are aware of an unauthorised bearing on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and working together with the police of Solihulls. we take the necessary legal steps to move it as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to support our evidence, it is very important that as many residents are an anti-social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101.</seg>
<seg id="1443">This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we suggest our case. "</seg>
<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof is Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise will be found.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the Gates of Freudenstadts will be renovated and will be reopened on March 1, next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof hotel through the then-time ambiance company GmbH, on 13 April 2014, a total of approximately 30 000 nights were lost per year and income by the local tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of an increasing number of refugees, which were offered in the county, the hotel building of the Landrat was offered as a collective accommodation, which led to controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not disputed at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all the Freudenstein-Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel's location and he already spoke of serious interest in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group of Luisenius, with offices in Bad Bergzabians, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in Berlin with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergamo and one in Bad Manalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof, a long time building container has been standing before the entrance, and when you enter the house, extensive renovations will be made.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings to be destroyed, old bathtubs from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The whole hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">By March there is still much to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">All should be called "pretty bourgeois" as Thomas Scherer expresses.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a jewel."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">They would not be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lauterbath, but already pointed out at a high level of downtown.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set wide, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual tourists, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">After the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer will not want to precisely determine exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Less than a million euros, it pays.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The outside facilities will also be placed on front, this is already evident.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard a large terrace, which is open to the restaurant, is open to public.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Investigator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair of US President Donald Trump, Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury for a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In the past few weeks, the Panel started work, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote under appeal to those people.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper continued the step as a sign that Mueller widened its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there is already the first sumptions of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us secret services accuse the Kremlin for long, targeted at the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trumps election team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men should stand up in the election campaign as advisor to the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment among the magnifying glass.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post" wrote in front of a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump must move into the centre and investigate the accusation whether the President of the affair had hindered the justice.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Lawys is to examine the evidence in possible breakage cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called bill-clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on if it is bigger and controversial case.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process is always provided behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to charge people under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the station CNN, pre-ladtions were issued, which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting were asked to be asked, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. also Trumps's consultant and son-egersson Jared Kushner as well as his former election head Paul Manafort he talks about this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-right experts said on Thursday evening in US television that Mueller won't allow Mueller to intimidate in his work, and that it should be necessary to act fast.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it doesn't necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the implementation of the body at the beginning of a new phase in examinations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of new revelations, the President held a speech in West Virginia in order to portray Russia affair as the campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's story is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The issue give the democrats a way to feel good, "because they can't have anything else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor to Ty Cobb declares nothing from the implementation of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this work usually work in secret, he emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorse any measures that accelerated the work of the special mediator on "fair" mode.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that I won't be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I don't have a reason to have changed something, it was the explanation of the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller had been only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this Rausal accused were accused of trump, he refused to impede justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June prior to a Senate committee, Trump asked him for setting the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the analysis.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to the representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special investigator of Congress such as in the Watergate affair, Richard Nixon ordered a position in which he could be fired at the presidents of the President of the Ministry of Justice in theory.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">On Thursday, two groups of republican and democratic senators were submitted to Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic Eisberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Arctic, a gigantic Eisberg has been replaced by the Schelfeis, just seven times the size of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The big Koloss sticks closer than a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers from now to the north and will probably be two, three years until it was melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest irants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To how far climate change played a role in the decline of the Eisberg, according to research information is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, in total, there have been a series of unusual intermounts for approximately 30 years in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many scientists, this could be connected with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken Koloss was now a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swimming in the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow in the sea and falls regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this lake was the equilibrium of waxes and disrupting a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Shelter is falling down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It also promise a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, for the front edge has never withdrawn so far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stand under tension and can be dissembled, if a piece abbrel in a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level since it floats on the water and ice as much water as it arises after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of closing price causes the glacier to flow directly to the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">It could possibly increase the sea level, although only in a small extent, the British research project writes to the observation of the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest Scelfeis of the Antarctica after AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the main road from mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural toes and not aware of a direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest withdrawal since the start of records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists may be argued whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will again grow back or long-term, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers adopt the demolition of this gigantic Eisberg to climate change, so many ice-bells of the Antarctic Peninsula have been discontinued in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tick of the Antarctica goes towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice-area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase contributed to decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees around the past 50 years and thus counting on the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1563">The overall concept was to be orientated within and outside, concrete measures for cross-dropouts and involve an expression initiative, the CDU, FDP and UWG are demanding.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has it to do with personal problems you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a regular "competition of public employers."</seg>

<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has been in operation only for one year, refused to express a detailed advance of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>

<seg id="1585">"we can only assess all claims that are currently collected, after we have collected all information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rained', the Iuventa, supervised since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that his crew took up dinghy-migrant, which can be delivered directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can leave, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was reportedly took place in front of the Libyan coast only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of suspend himself to the authority of Italian coast-guards, which supervises rescue races in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motifs.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first have an Italian police officers who supervised their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations, have previously prepared to keep the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary, but acceptable no "essential changes or disability" would bring their bailout to their bailouts.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign him is the Nobel laureate organisation doctors without limits (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In the past few weeks, Minniti said that the number of migrants returned to Italy in recent weeks has declined sharply that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal weather and the cooperation with local citizens.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further conversations with Libyan Citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Anstiege and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin Foreign post" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern pfalz, to enjoy four days of trials and landmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three befriend guides were available.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led during hot summer temperatures in the vineyards of the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far beyond the älzer forest and the pre-besieged levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between, there were always longer ascents for the long trial.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, the viewpoint relied to the viewpoint, linked by "florets" Trials and moderate ascent.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days many elevation had been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought the welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers attained a healing Sole in the Freiluftoratorio.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt has also been controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters, the group had met the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - shoes equipment for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the Sport Stars stay in front of computer consoles, rather than sweaty with wind and weather to fight over the Stadionrasen?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport is long since become a serious business to become a lucrative business - huge stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high charges included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first federal ligavers who are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">At the beginning of 2015 the VfL Wolfsburg, which was followed by the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, founded a E-Sport section in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to enthuse all new young target groups for the VfB," says President Jochen Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1618">He is sure that several clubs can ascend on this train. "</seg>
<seg id="1619">Next weekend, FIFA World Cup, FIFA World Cup, organised the first "Interactive Club World Cup," in which Gamer will compete against each other in various clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven are qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Also Robin Dutt sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising a agency for virtual football players.</seg>

<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried all kinds of markets, especially the Asian, to conquer.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract you could be present online far more often in these markets, than once in the year to send the federal government to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">Why is it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-Sport, computer games like "League Of Legends", "DotA 2," "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation are fostered on competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, as in normal sport, Ligen have also established itself in which the pros can compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian games, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it just a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly used to get used.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Froby has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports- University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitively and found many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also need cognitive abilities, technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only exercise at the console but also train their body and look for nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fine player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobatic also sees problems: "doping is becoming more a theme."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to perform at online games, and in the scene the structures of classical Sports are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasize the high integrative effect of E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are international, like a big global family, there is no intercultural inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the consulting consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts to E-Sport a rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales are expected to rise to 130 million in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the almost 2.4 billion euro in the Bundesliga, this is a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-Sport "is not far away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte advisor.</seg>
<seg id="1646">International and many countries are already continuing.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Great markets are Asia and the United States, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are taking part in the US Team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the esport competition Unicrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Also in Europe does a lot.</seg>
<seg id="1650">In a Norwegian school E-Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobatic.</seg>
<seg id="1651">In the Netherlands and France, the Soccer League clubs according to Dutt, are obliged to establish an e-sport department.</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB-President Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1653">Only in nostalgia, and to clear the old times, is no longer sufficient today.</seg>
<seg id="1654">It is therefore the tradition of the association to preserve but the company is at the same time to set up the modern market.</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digital world," says Dutt.</seg>
<seg id="1656">"you can't hold fast, that only in football everything remains as it was always."</seg>

<seg id="1658">Almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal by gifted eggs.</seg>
<seg id="1659">Aldi South and Aldi Nord have reacted and sold all eggs from the sale in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1660">In shelves only eggs are to be taken, which is demonstrably not a fibreil.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter, because of the lyrics, was committed suicide for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to parole.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was condemned in June because of the killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said to the hearing on Thursday: "my family is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">She was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years but her legal representative argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered a mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Dressed in red trousers and a cream color blouse, Carter stood with tears in the eyes, folded hands and downward, when she was convicted.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the Attorney at the court.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"she finished his life to make her own life better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">She did not assume responsibility, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown a repentance."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters had a lawyer, it's a "terrible circumstance for it to be completely regretted."</seg>
<seg id="1675">Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that her "age or Reifegrad or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A prosecutor is reading a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy, who said it was "no day, I am not entrusted to the loss of my beloved son.</seg>

<seg id="1678">Sister's sister, Camdyn Roy, said they will never be persecuted by knowledge, "she will never be able to take part in her brother's wedding, or a aunt for his children.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"not more to have this single person, with whom I had been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will keep staying with me for the rest of my life," she said.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was killed by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention, after Carters revealed text news releases, that she encouraged him to finish his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"Häng you, spring from a building, don't know, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was with his family on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the moment before his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you must do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter searched attention through the death of Roy where he ordered that they should benefit from any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder of her British co-resident in Italy in 2007, was acquitted before two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Fort Knox, 30 years old, published in the Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter earns compassion and help, not prison."</seg>
<seg id="1689">Joshua Kimmich: learn from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="1690">That Joshua Kimmich was running at the Audi Cup as a captain, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern faces the match-fed Cup winner a big season - not harm you extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Anything was different on his place in the cabin, that Joshua Kimmich looked immediately, even if the extra piece was very small.</seg>
<seg id="1693">But since far and wide at the second day of the Audi Cup, no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer has been to see, he made the hurry to be divided into the arm.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the coach has not announced it," told the winner of the Confed Cup winner, after his first deployment as Bayern captain.</seg>
<seg id="1695">Good, the entrance could have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.</seg>
<seg id="1696">But I could interpret the symbol from the coach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Not the eight year older Arturo Vidal was chosen in the professionals, debutant and just out of the holiday experienced professionals of existing C-Elf as a toy leader, but he.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugar is aesting to those who want to give a lot of love that you want to keep in mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Whoever has been chosen to compete for Lahm's heritage can only use a small extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimmich confirmed: "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">On Wednesday the 22-year-old was equipped as mini Lahm across the field.</seg>
<seg id="1702">Right behind, this is now its position, the white binder at the arm did its rest.</seg>
<seg id="1703">And at all, Kimmich took part in this starting information as the one who can also take the rod in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed troupe.</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had a look for the whole, while many others were busy with herself.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Vidal therefore, with his lack of fitness to play (foldable hardly); Renato Sanches, on the devils, go out on the achievements of the Asia-journey (folding also only due to); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle could not drop a negative appearance in their first appearance in Bavaria-Trikot.</seg>
<seg id="1707">After all, it worked very well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both were sovereign sovereign.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The well-occupied Napoli storm is very difficult, in addition, Süle also tried to get a few times even in the playing construction.</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy said that the result was "not so, as we were hoping for."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a decent performance during their debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">Game shift, tempo change: "I was also fetched for this style."</seg>
<seg id="1713">As unusual, this Bayern World is still looking for re-coming, you saw in connection to the game.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Rudy for example gave not one or two interviews in the catacombs, instead of six or seven interviews.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimmich said goodbye after a few gunting statements in his new poker player.</seg>
<seg id="1716">There he heard an interesting phrase by Süle: "what is going on here now I have noticed.</seg>
<seg id="1717">With Bavaria you just have to win every game. "</seg>
<seg id="1718">After all, he must not teach the new one more.</seg>

<seg id="1726">It is often not irreconcilable to have the relationship between the land and the regional economy as Eveline Lemke (Green) nor Economic Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is shown after more than one year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Company (VTU), says: "Wismar is attacking the desires of the economy, the Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest reversal in infrastructure policy is called Natus in Infrastructure Policy: the Lücker of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now on top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">This year, the ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 is to stand for the construction.</seg>
<seg id="1732">A role in the plans of the country also plays the Westumberung Trier, which stands in the intrusive need of the Federal Constitutional Plan.</seg>
<seg id="1733">The goal is to take the route in December 2020, says Minister-speaking Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus sees in this a sign to support regional, but internationally competing companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) develops how from Wissing, at the wine a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to create a company's own company.</seg>
<seg id="1737">In Trier, the Handwerkskammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="1738">A premium of 1000 Euro for the Component Mastertest and 2500 Euro is provided, when graduates within ten years can make his master training independently.</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">The planned road construction could quickly create facts, at the same time, it commands to the country at the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, managing director of the Chamber of Industry of Trier.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Of 56 new engineers who wants to set up Wissing at the regional company mobility, are until now only 29 places occupied.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be distributed to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In 2017, the CDU & D Christian Baldauf extension refers to the calculations of the host country, the country invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and more in the receipt of national roads as proposed.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank Natus also expects the country's concept as it wants to fix the labour in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">Furthermore, the old broadband expansion was in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1746">In 2016, regional companies had only rated power supplies in an IHK survey with a note of 3.4.</seg>
<seg id="1747">They complained about molding Internet connections and breakthroughs.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described companies as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides, emit diesel engines, are regarded as carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers, plants to neutralise the exhaust gases to install exhaust gases, also take out what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignoring the powerful auto companies and to ignore the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which could regulate emissions of so-called depreciation devices to comply with emissions, but when a car was tested, but during normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States several employees were indicted by Volkswagen, others are explored on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former director of the Thermodynamik was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former Manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be placed in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen, after the authorities have acceded up a system to deal with emission regulations in Europe, and a request that focused on the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he struck himself among other things as a drawing for congratulation - what frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the most fortunate day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 1960s, the breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo has many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">And again the artists were inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Big, roundish Mordillo figures are in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, his own data is still sitting on the drawing, working almost ten hours a day.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agrarian Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence was effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and in autumn, much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium transfers the Zwergzikaden, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only woven for tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of an journalists underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce meet normally on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unceasing drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to tell you that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Discussing two high-ranking journalists, which feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children with the office, which were in 2009 the goal of an attack with grenades, or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have three words written on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perception and abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of getting the secret list of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest periods of violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are frequent, there are always more journalists at this time: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, at least seven killed in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The latter is the editor and her Inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence linked to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is felt deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, representing his midfinger with the word "Justice" hangs in the three-thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-shirts, who show his ridiculous face with glasses or typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though 2010 was a general meeting of the Attorney General to process the cases of journalists, this led to the committee to protect journalists from only two penal procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As in most of the thousands of murders, which are joined by drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers are only rare in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inevitable and although the terrain is still traced.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the killer, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why we're suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced by his car and was shot at him for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is being translated with the "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, since rival factions were fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that Sinaloa should be shot every day or more people on the street, or that the cemetery is full of galvanised, two-story mausoleums for drug diners that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the debt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all there was the publication of a interview with Damasco Lopez, one of the rivaling cartel fractions in war with Guzmans' sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release might have been annoyed by the sons, susprated power members every copy of the edition when she was extradited to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was to force Valdez for the confession of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for his own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues could imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism, without hitting the intoxicant problem," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the brave and honest reporting, and the turnover and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it to release hard meetings without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it was.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live" he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take over the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I do not want to be asked: "what have you done about so many scooter... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could fluke a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted to his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite from the office, and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine practice?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their home runways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not permitted," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-chancelling and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, apply no more - just as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees met by Riodoce on safety training, suddenly there were no phones allowed. days earlier has been known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">There were two policemen outside the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the regional government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-floor district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen that the Governor himself did not have trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug ties de facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has blocked three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the former famous writer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending, which focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">There was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the State Theatre, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it was so, so there was caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite bar of drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled the whole century all the political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal bat the reporter of writing about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers received the column of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we knew what happened," Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slim body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected, activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporam Miriam Ramirez caught a few signs and went in the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the Attorney General.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become stronger in the whole country by having written down in organized protests in the SOS Press.</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to destroy journalists and destroy them, because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked that she was once again divided by the government, because she is worried that their anger has violated their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez repeatedly had said that journalists in Mexico organized by organized crime, encircled by the government officials and a valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporter were not only killed by drug candidates, but also on orders of politicians and security forces with organized crimes under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group "Articulo 19" conducted more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you hold your mouth," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgetting the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern borders of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Your body was found along with a note that allegedly signed by the Candidate cartel: "here I am because of my reports." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones were beside her separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some stores have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in northern borders of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as it did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo following the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez introduces the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are fled from their own states or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile and still observe the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are chased, as it seems apparently the photographer of Reuben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, is to find that drug trafficking are frightened.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight, on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat down at the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, as at once all their telephones began.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting paintings featuring bandaging and security forces near the resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued, as it was promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the on-board edge, they have published news on the website of Riodoce on cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the following day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirenen heats near - a further shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez cast a look at the police officers who thought guard to see if they were willingness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid of all, they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the huge portrait of the famous founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed its traces.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about it," said Bojorquez, "If on the same day, Javier has been murdered, the trainee asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, though a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now, researchers have found out that the first insights of the incredible Nashorn of an Canadian miner have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa by dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even realize that his scaly skin was from reddish brown - and they said it would have had something of a "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report published in Current Biology "published it as the stery-held Dinosaurs, who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Being incredibly well preservated state, researchers created it as "truly remarkable"</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the Armored plant ore is the best preserved Fossil in its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was near Fort McMurray on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, and grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something which looks out of the surrounding rocks of the place, and decided to look more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years in order to expose the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're only a little blind eye, you could almost believe that it's slept," said the master author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"there will be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs specimens - Mona Lisa and Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this plant-vores, although it is covered with a armor, and resembles a changeable tank, probably threatened by the carnivorous dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white cloak to hide in front of prey, and used a paratrocity that is known as counterattening, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to expand its enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now shown at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have studied the wild animal and it was called Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, to document the patterns and the form of scales and arms over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the border shady, a widespread defense method in animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the border is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals survives today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs roasted enough pressure by the flesh of the vore dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that have the reverse shady - think of deer, Zebras or girdles - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which is signalized that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong Raubtier behaviors on a solid, strong panicked dinosaurs, how dangerous the dinosaurs have been to have been the Cretaceous period," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on critics above his life, including its conservative intestinal, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, was caught up into a river and was driven into the sea, where he sank to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta it was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with conservative skin, but also available in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly like in the early crayon.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just play a little with the eyes, you could almost believe he is at sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when giant Theropods, carnivorous dinosaur, stood on two legs crossed on earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaurs was chased by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tonnes heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists who appear to appear in Current Biology indicates that Borealopelta sank after the death in the sea and mumifies in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, in the vicinity of Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the surviving dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant sweater was curved by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater state of the dinosaur store his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the hood still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a winning in lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Hidden remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that wear the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers crossed upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole '.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: Massenkarambolage on A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Hefty accident on Thursday night on the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass blowage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous distillings, kilometres and gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the highway Stuttgart-München (A8), on the late afternoon afternoon, some 20 people were injured at a mass-arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The first data on the police were at 17.00 hrs. between the connecting places Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, under 30 vehicles, including trucks, interconnecting them.</seg>
<seg id="1976">There are no statements about the exact number of injured.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It is about slight to moderate injury, said a polishing precher.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A big array of rescue vehicles was at the accident point.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was fully locked towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich, some ten kilometres long back was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like a AZ reporter, it also appeared on the road to massive impediments - by numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade settled down the license plates of the vehicle, which now have to count with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45, a second accident occured on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dlease.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group test "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffering.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The Schaffner comes and wakes up an unsettled or irritate the gliast in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Card control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of breaks are over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn currently tests the single card control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that is taken to be taken and evaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test run runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"when the offer comes, we will expand it.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It is expected to be available at many further routes in Germany in the beginning of next year, "said a slide-speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"check-in" is called by train the card classification without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">To use them, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And one has to have booked an online ticket - what already do most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to have purchased over the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And lastly, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "Comfort check-in" works so: it is ascending in the train, calling its ticket under "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test client then appears a button for electronic validation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The attackers get a message on their mobile devices that chassis X is located on the train and took the booked seat for Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">In case of ticket inspection at number Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already taken online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, keep on to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the clients, one for the rail - which in turn is to take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to travel without ticket control by our train crew, check out in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables the passengers to design your travel time in the train, "says Michael Peterson, marketing executive board of DB remote services.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often travel, knows that, beside the delays and passports, the ticket-card controls are one of the biggest trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one does not have any documents in any case, but one of them does not need any documents which you need for analysis of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or the ID card or the ID is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between train attitudes and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the advantage or greater space and delays in control of your own tickets and the Schaffner takes the time to take care of other issues.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that also applies to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food.</seg>
<seg id="2018">More traction numbers on the same route are not unlocked yet.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shaken up to her heart.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment that rented and scrollded by Facebook on their phone.</seg>

<seg id="2024">Confused when nobody had posted the information on their feed, she joined Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retarded on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old boy, who was killed live by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of browns lesheer body, stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"it is wild," he thought Ferrel.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She moved her mobile phone to record tweets on the Canfield drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and by a man who claimed to be his father's father, who bore a sign with the inscription, "Fergusons Police killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">It observed a live Feed where a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, secured a other policeman his rifle and cried, "I will kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," remembering their testimony.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to us and which we call ourselves typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt scills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was mad and cried. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson in the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11.</seg>

<seg id="2042">When Ferrel with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a matching crown, the two had a conversation, which they had plenty of times before this morning "over the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for this, what do they believe?" remember what she said.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not bring them away, "said Ferrel later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">She needs to know and see it, and they will be raised in it.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was waiting for a camping area than the activists on the possible non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrel and her daughter have joined with a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to transfer them to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for feral shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority student Nurse Association and focused on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrel met, during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came to Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often of white - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestract.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought about the project Ferrell, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>

<seg id="2068">As a result we show documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells live, as she got in love and her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrel and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and for the dehumanization of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history is repeating the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">In 2012, two of the three founders of the Movement, who formed the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012, identifies the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women need to carry the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is held really of black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it is insisted that "this is not a affirmful type of action," when Ferrell has been selected as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook her energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although it was on the front line, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman stands as much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">The news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connection between the church and the police remain.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Feral is on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social environment of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she is committed to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, even though it is not yet built.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian zone pushes the population in proponent and adversaries since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject very cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be a real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a human being" (Siggi Bearing) or quite simply: "size!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents are building that a gallery will take more customers into the city, and the other shops will fear, that then the pedestrian area will be bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market stands, in the 13 direct market share their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will begin at the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Beda place with the possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping for many years almost every week in the farmers market.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are very happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's butcher.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also that.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if direct market is located in a market hall in the gallery, the rent is to rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The new project should probably not be low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is shopping for shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, dryfish or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shoppers can stand here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because at least the product offered is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is primed in charge.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shoppers are rented in a shopping mall just by larger companies, because the rentals are often not portable.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special stores, there are almost no more and what still is left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle suits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market stands out during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit Gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already take the ghost bit gallery previously to distribute all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that stands blank, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my view it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a striking hall, it is thanks to the crazy many - as I find - sensual construction projects in Bitburg is no place any more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmhouse is capturing, a piece of culture will vanish again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces have to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupside and haircuts, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after they publicly traded diplomatic announcements on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline took their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a tranwoman and a pioneering dissident, whose condemnation had been converted from Barack Obama only three days.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA which could look from Manning and out of the 30 portraits, such as some intellectual commentary can not only be created with these genomic data, the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent detection of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, was found openly about the identification as a woman, in 2013 was sentenced to 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">The prison was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in the Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and a platinblonde vig bears with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forenic artifacts like cigarette stumps and chewing gum by extracted the DNA from the waste, in order to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg announced at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were wasted to exterminate several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic at Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "soups images," who would predict the future and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning would release following seven brutal years in a Kansas Military Prison, was a welcome kind of happy support.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep in the opening of the exhibition some deeper and strong, as Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the government camps and against transgender troops, in order to remove new, tweeter ways, which he should fix, further to discharge.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg is asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a specific reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for Manning with its oversize signature [the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall their mitochondrial DNA sequence is written - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the advanced scientific Lexicon of the artist), how amazingly, at least in biological ways we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take away is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective it," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious memories, is also shown.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in an own room is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novels.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as it emerges with a release of hands in the hand out of the disciplines of the United States, such as king-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they chill your words, then they have won," says it.</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I'm getting goosebumps if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the show personally - just as they were supposed to do in the comic book - but when they should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, of their own genomic simulators, like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning stature), with which their genetic Haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said by the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement, forming itself with Chelsea, as the movement, which was also behind her liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">University of Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford for the murder</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and a employee of the University of Oxford which had been chosen as suspects, after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants due to murder because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the district court of Cook County are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several bulls.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A warning system published by the Chicago Police authorities said that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Civil servants received a call, came in at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still alive at the place of events for dead, and Detectives examine the bulations as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been a professor of biology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice-President for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem will now be judged and excluded from the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the relevant authorities, and northwestern University cooperates at this study," said Cubbage.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A speaker at the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investigative authorities in any imaginable manner."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The testimony was added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Administration, Anthony Guglielmi, said he demanded the suspects to challenge the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of her place of residence, and our efforts to locate it," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a petalled tip that was something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victims had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Grand Plaza's management team published an explanation of the residents: "the police currently works on the time axis and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives, including a possible case."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will close the WADA timetable in the near future" - the Russian Vice Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Vice President Vitaly Mutko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of WADA for compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for rereplacement of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko he contains nothing, which could cause a concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping agencies approved the reported results of the dossier by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren to have publicly sponsored by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "we lead the investigation since our anti-doping system has put an error.</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">But there was no state programs, and we will not admit something that exists. "</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales outlet RSport at the beginning of the day Smirnov was problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly told that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">No one has to accept this report unconditional, "smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of Doping scandals at WADA by the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti-doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA-General Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving in the right direction "to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2212">Salvation said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and polls of certain teams, it offers a heat-card of the company that shows that units have the most complaints and which executives have low supplement results - so that you can drill, why.</seg>

<seg id="2221">It offers an anonymous SMS hotline, which can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the leader is included, complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of Public opinion covers the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is treated badly or inethically, it may experience costly consequences arising by consumers-boycott, employee fluctuation and gages, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 locations, Convercent for more than one year has been used to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures, and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, when an employee wished to report a problem, he had to submit a telephone number or e-mail to the corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS general Counsel, who said it was not a good way to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, since the company converters convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers who were hidden in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair interce- faster and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It goes on 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA-footballers chat on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus.</seg>

<seg id="2265">NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players, and it actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore the first three trainings of UCLA should begin at 19: 15 a.m., in order to fulfill the already packed time schedule of the player.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the brood moved almost one week after the last season, during the summer school during Moras six playing times in Westwood practical exercises.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was a swallow for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-er years.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced a turbulent history of his cozy headquarters in the irl River valley in Kent, and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look to the writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'a Castle in England "spans the time from the Middle Ages until the era of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac handleiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It's not the first book of Rhodes which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted on the thumb-print on the side of a letter that was written by a double minded man in the 1700-s who worked for the Jacobins." he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell after smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the odor has a effect as if he himself would be there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Ah, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who has been defeated so with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ("To be honest: I have considered a little over to my welcome") seems to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and the many treasures and curiosity of the castle, like about the monstrous of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the land and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape-care, gardener and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received the full access as the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the employees began to worry about the archive, which he spoke as "hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps that represent what he had said: "they could mean that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all his gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to tune in to the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil, which appeared in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly family of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasantry began in this area and I thought, a revolt was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are linked together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit tomb, hidden in the English Reformation for seven years.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', represented in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, produced his own burial, filled with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his sarg was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a gauner, getting back debts and spending money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men delve their school-birds, giving them rich old women, I imagine them as a heap of good looking guys, with a talent to advertise. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his bet in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique screaming experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki behind him, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been returned by nature again.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go back," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like: "Oh, now I have to cope with that accursed life."</seg>
<seg id="2323">Campaign launched: over 300 years old Marienkapelle wrapped in Rhöndorf</seg>
<seg id="2324">With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand (Rundschau of Thursday).</seg>
<seg id="2325">Until Thursday, Mayor Otto NEUHOFF and his head team want to keep the logo and slogan secret by Nelson Artz.</seg>
<seg id="2326">At the end of August there will be a highlight of the campaign on the Island of Grafenwerth.</seg>
<seg id="2327">"too nice for us.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Or?, ask the makers of action since yesterday on posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"we think it (of course!) not really," write them online on her yesterday website.</seg>
<seg id="2330">"but we use this measure to gain your attention.</seg>
<seg id="2331">And to make clear that something is better than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="2332">Basically we are the firm belief that we know as bad Honnefer people around the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "</seg>
<seg id="2333">With the action it is more than "just a logo and a slogan, it's going on.</seg>
<seg id="2334">"it is true to formulate a sole promise, one that gives the city a distinctive design feature."</seg>
<seg id="2335">Eventually they arise in competition with other municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="2336">The city's Bad Honnef lets its new umbrella brand and the campaign cost a mid-five-digit amount.</seg>
<seg id="2337">Military Reforms in Turkey - Earogans Anxiety in front of the Army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Every year in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) publishes on pensionings and subsidies in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Like this week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was not held in the building of the General Staff, as previously, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The presidency also participated in the presidents under the presidency of the government, as well as the five vice-presidents and the Minister of Defence, Inneres, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">By doing so, civilians in the YAS were in the number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government moved the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">General Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commander of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admiral channels.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees the Erdogan as a wire-loss.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who should have been directly involved in the coup attempt, will have been involved in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow of a "divine gift" as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have a grip on?</seg>
<seg id="2352">In late February the newspaper "Hurriyet" published an article with the heading "discomfort in the military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there is concerns of an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself in the repeal of the headscarf ban for soldators, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The large cleaning process in the army and the security forces continue.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July Erdogan assigns another 7395 state service, among them 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">There seemed, that Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they slipped on their role as keepers of the secular state of state.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step, not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say, Erdogan is heading towards the Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe" an unnamed officer, who sought for asylum in fear of persecution in fear of persecution, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and loafists in a few years."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, NATO could not leave Nato cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Anyway, in the alliance, there is doubts about the readiness to help the Turkish army.</seg>
<seg id="2364">The leadership structures and operationals are "weakened," said Nato diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Washington changes the rules for the Green Card</seg>
<seg id="2366">There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump, quoted from the media.</seg>
<seg id="2367">He sees prior to lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stringent provisions for visitation of visas for a temporary work permit and limitations for family-oriented visas.</seg>
<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"this law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do that by the US will change the way of citizens from other countries of Green Cards."</seg>
<seg id="2371">The law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system.</seg>
<seg id="2372">This new candidate procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that will benefit from our economy, "said Trump, cited by the American media.</seg>
<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to renovate the route for Rennes shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Again, over the past few months had been contested by the future of the slab shuttles - now it is said to go quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At the end of the year the tour is scheduled to be built, on which the tour train runs.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the racing platform long term, according to the Department of the Department of Transport, construction work is scheduled to start this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to continue to order and refurbish the distance of Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is particularly familiar with the tourism important link," said traffic state Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the track has reduced to about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">By that sum, the country exceeded 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country, will now be final agreed, declared Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The ministry and the South-eastern railway as operators are already in charge of technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"thus, the timetable, which are used for vehicles and quality standards," said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The race-stiff shuttle should be ordered to be available on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig shuttle is an especially popular rail link between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">During a pilot line in the past few months, the distance of sufficiently many people had been used to order them again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The route is also very dilapidated in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be any more crazy in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robot) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascent seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will get them much more common," said Mr Sharkey when publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexports have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone gum which feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust its robots accordingly to their convictions, "and select everything from the robotic colour of the robot on the form of the nipple to the type or colour of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is worrying as many robots have the "personalities," which would make a stepford wife progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicone.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties, which are attracting, such as shimmering.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold Sex-Robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of schooling and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," warms the Website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its moods over the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this ascent of sex robotic robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subtful female properties that go to rape, if one goes one step to Frigid (i.e. here: conflicting) Farrah is an untroubled most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, then why can men then have no Roxxxy?" means it's on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication indicate a little darker and deep in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course do not keep sex robots, and while the FRR indicated their increasing popularity, they remain provisionally on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what riddled out of the border zones, can be in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very educational.</seg>
<seg id="2413">Many people are not strange or insulting, until they give the free market to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly sophisticated sex robots are threatened in a time, in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House, which has been summoned to have sexual assault.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the handmaid ') are not the graphical images, the swallowed body and the outstretched eyes but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builder want that they feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, when it comes to its "personalities" the robots represent no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Expressed differently: they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrases by 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps Big Performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He does Mitt Romney to the epitome of healthy lives</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become one of the trump of trump era that the political divisions have polarized the US voters, even families in the small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers with reviews about how to deal with the horror of Trump chosen relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all allegedly hurry up to let our filets burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power Trumps, Families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a linquered poet who lives in Chicago and has long been living with republicans in our family who visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone knows them, including the republican relationship, with whom she had fought for decades, suddenly and quite strange at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it inevitably comes to me that this brings considerable risks associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the acting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that we will no longer meet the cookies of one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a scary long-term scenario where Trump republicans of the right wing "normalizes" that suddenly appears as the epitome of poisoning suddenly in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I think today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the decline - the dog at the Autodach, which knew 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in fact, compared to trump in fact occur to a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify for an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>

<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously big, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scared and the animals turn to look at full fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the fierce music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city becomes not just the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five-five years later, and I am still not throughout the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub ye Olde Swiss cottage doesn't count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magic experience since here two-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option to pay rating with a 15% tip money - this is to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to initiate personality in a situation, in which no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store has apologizing, while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from the prison to the hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">In the past year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schnsuffered from his wrists to the hospital, according to a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the prosecutors against a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine's Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet drain in his house in Pretoria on it.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night intruder who hidden himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their purpose, this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, from which they say that they would be considerate.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Code, said that she would raise the appeal by the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years, if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Must diesel drivers participate in action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group software updates have offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve the emissions behaviour of the emissions of the emissions in Euro 5 and some Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanine by ACE Auto Club Europe are assessing:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action compulsory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the released software updates are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have cheering software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The retrofitting provided by the Federal Chancellery (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The makers have announced a speedy implementation in the coming months, but not yet called a precise date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has communicated to writing every person.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If anyway an inspection is due, it will be done in their frame.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long will the equipment be drawn up altogether?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"difficult to say," Smetanine says.</seg>
<seg id="2508">It depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"for we have seen, the car manufacturer did not approach the environment so far." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time consuming might be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do drivers do, who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE will advises you to wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Probably foreign manufacturers would imitate, such as Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is now a massive price drop of Euro-4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE fears that.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But just in the regions where passengers can threaten.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, goes to Rente in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The site is already written - but the applicant is rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been working for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun, as he mediates in the press interview.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks, waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, so far no application is to fill the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - under respecting the regular term of regular term - still enough time for an elaboration.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach acts for the administration community as an undere building authority, the applicant must counterpoint the applicant.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If you don't have to fill it out, the citizens would have to take care of assistance up to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the city is very important to the city and himself, Wacker, who reported by a good operating climate, as well as good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">Over 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, to the wacker proudly looks back with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city life worth," he is sure about the building's office and staff.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Varied projects are also present in the future: the reshaping of the former Hukla-Areas and the Duthobic area around are stimulated.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The cinematic bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium restoration is still subject.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone will beech some 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design is present for a municipal master builder.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslachs its own building yard and gardening can be flexibly reacted by many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," so Wacker, and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the oldtown as a ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to have an eye on what purifies "when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the separator's master builder.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the city master carries great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is a builder, "at the end everything is going through my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">With care and coordination, he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been working for ten years now, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been working for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also, his successor will be long, Wacker: "we are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">For continuity is not only important to a good company, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Who would like to be buried by Roland Wacker should be able to study a university engineer or a bachelor's degree program in the fields of construction and building planning.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The municipal office stand high-tech and deep-building, construction planning, burunderlining chairs, administration of urban Property, municipal farm with building yard and municipal property, including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bicycle on lines thrown: south railway line locked</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, the unknown offenders had thrown the blue bike from the railway line in the area of the Leobatic Street (B116) on the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">They were so badly damaged that the suspending goods had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go from two male offenders and seek them for the night of night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the crime scene a rosary scooter and a bicycle-driver had been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lausitz coup," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to the APA.</seg>
<seg id="2571">The perpetrators have brought himself into great danger and also at risk to train.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition to the damage at the locomotive and the facility, as well as the late-minute drive and the costs for the rail-up traffic could even come to Pönalen's clients.</seg>
<seg id="2573">In total, a considerable sum of "considerable sum, the speaker said.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damage were again fixed on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south railway was led without disability.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Nearly ten people were retired Friday morning, two of them entered the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains were not falling, but they were delayed.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to the ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch had to be exchanged for about 200 meters of overhead lines.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate might help to alleviate IBD (inflammation</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases could alleviate symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the U.S. and in Great Britain 300,000, causes stomach cramps and blings, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the parties usually get advised to relieve flesh and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins, found to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolled in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food, do not infiltrate in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments he found that a kind of tolerance of the immune cell cell in mice was demonstrated that a particular bacterium in its initiates carry.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus certeri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan are tolerant, less inflammatory botherus, if the same system performs with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immunity when it found out that a group of study regimes had such cells, but a different group of the same stem, but that had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It thought that the difference with the gut microbids of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">Mice were sequenced to DNA sequenzes and were found in six bacterial species, which were present in mice with immune cells, but without being missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a gut microbiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were created by L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria accumulate on the immune system, the researchers ate L. reuteri in a liquid and then brought small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerate cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan metabolism, which is known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells decreased by around 50 percent, but if the tryptoptophanaten was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant-tolerating cells like mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri are developing the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to foster, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential can lead high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2622">New proposal for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As the wind turns, as Sigmar Gabriel was still rotating, looked up social and ministerial presidents always with some concern to Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Only no storyfire from the party central, merely no headwind from the covenant - so was the most important wish of the election champion.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz, the party has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-House also watch the events in the SPD-regulated state capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has been given from there since the beginning of the year, would not be described in the approach with headwinds.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were deep attacks.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And indeed one by another.</seg>
<seg id="2630">According to the surprising end of the red-green majority of Lower Saxony, the German Federal CDU see a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once more: red-green can simply not be reliable," said CDU-Secretary Peter Tauber the editorial network of Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising questionnaire by a Green MEPs has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the daily election, his red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green-President, Michael waiter, has invited people to return to Elke Tvests to return their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The crossing of the CDU means a clear distortion of the voters.</seg>

<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD-President of Lower Saxony, stands after the crossing of the Green Mvests of Elke Twest until the CDU without their own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what's next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misc began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, nothing more, reassuring the comrades swiry.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">That became well - and indeed everything was clearly worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the docking, the Düsseldorf-Pleite cut the party smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Laboriously the comrades raged down in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And the next blow came with him.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD politician, lost his Nimbus at that weekend because he was seated in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burned.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he did not make anything wrong in the crisis communication, doing what you can make wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then Scholz fights for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the Volkswagen exhaust and his role in the supervisory board, the Lower Saxony's Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Mithy requestioned values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Anyway, or maybe, because in the past few weeks, Weil wanted to get stronger in the covenant of accents in the past few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The endeavours of the former Mayor of Hanover, to build its power in Berlin, was also not hidden in the category of Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They allowed him, as they spoke of Weil a stabilisation of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Because there is no guilt in the Party of the Lower Saxony, because there is no fault in this party.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz was not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">Sometimes, comrades strive every effort to hold their own ranks closed.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Their anger is directed toward the Greens, and above all on the sloping parliamentarians in Twest.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democrafty, like woman Tests, her own career entry on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of the party left in the SPD parliament, the editorial network of Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Woman Twest is not elected as a direct-channel, but on the state list of the Lower Saxony's Green Party, so the deacon of Saxon deputies further.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2676">At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Wuerttemberg has acquired two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The income amounted to 60 percent in the rehabilitation region II from 2005 to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "successful project" - it is ultimately important to promote the inner development and not only to develop new buildings.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Government of the Government of Karlsruhe will receive the information that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The amount will amount to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would be from the country, the rest of the village.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a rehabilitation area now?</seg>
<seg id="2682">One will continue to examine so Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role, whether in the planned territory is at all interest, to sange.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the area borders may be moving again.</seg>

<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be fixed as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The funding period for the funding period runs until 1 January 2017 or 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the stock capacity would only be carried out as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">As anticipated, in November or December, the amendment will take place in order to begin with the renovations in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann discerning that each Commune had carried out the pre-researches.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about judging and decide the urban sidents and decide when sanction is and in what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">The plot is then also included in the basic book for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will again come again to Empfingen and make a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel stressed a major success factor for the project be the participation of those involved.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks, and be completed by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "building and boundary relationship," in which it works for structural condition and refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the grey questionnaire, the "fiscal and housing", data may be made to size, dividing and residents of a living space.</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "Operation bogen" can be filled only if there are business premises in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, Gotzel pointed out that a fill questionnaire is not at the same time a request for conveying agents is not at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2703">New construction measures are also not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler stressed that the distribution of conveying agents after the "greyhound principle" functionally - who first comes, mahlt first.</seg>

<seg id="2714">The promotional fees of the White House cost the taxpayers thousands</seg>
<seg id="2715">The decision of the White House, to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn, which raises the American production last month, taxpayers will cost up to $24,000 US dollars according to the military service provided by the TIME magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Head of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited beside a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The Military Bureau of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Lawn, after the recordings of the Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), who is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted to realize that you are aware of it because it's an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the Commander of HMx-1 on the eve of the event its superior, the Deputy naval mandeur for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The report showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 7: 00 in the morning at the South Lawn, and so long, until the grass was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Note adds that if your departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team would need a second squad due to the restriction of the service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight indication was during the event during the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Recordings provided by the TIME was not clear, however, if a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal government to use government ownership for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMx-1 has asked if the event could harm the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question that we exhibited was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," the deputy commander answered.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the President gave a violation for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and propagated the efforts to increase government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One, from politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2733">President is obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But their use just for a photo procedure is obvious, is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">Trump carried out an investigation in February, as the Presidential plane in front of his first Kampagnenrallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complained about the use of the Presidential plane by its predecessors.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is enthralled by the show" Made in America "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said vice director of the White House, Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMx-1 occupations often lead training flights to Washington and South Lawn in order to impose US President at the White House with more precise Zentimetables.</seg>
<seg id="2738">As a trump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMx-1 led to the White House 58 exercise landings.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The flight for the "Made in America" event counted during the training requirement for the month, said an official.</seg>
<seg id="2740">In addition 11 hours of this day Helikopter units floats for "non-presidential support commissions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers were not taking the burden for any of the other props that were presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A speaker by Sikorsky said that the company would not have been involved to put a helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMx-1 does not maintain budgetary records for the Presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to Stundentarization of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD replacement for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight lesson.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit recorded flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"to determine the cost of taxpayers on the basis of accounting estimates is highly misleading," said Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding."</seg>
<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, the rates for DoD does not include staff costs, but consider costs for fuel, maintenance and contract.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At that time, the former press precher of the White House, Sean Spicer defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week things that are manufactured in America," Spicer said.</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think, as most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">It is, of course, adequately emphasized that. "</seg>
<seg id="2755">It was not clear whether Trump with the helicopter interagated when he entered his tour over South Lawn by the South Lawn, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fireman.</seg>
<seg id="2756">At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and overthrew the media over his own fleet of company products.</seg>
<seg id="2757">"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburg Domspatzen report about the abuse of abuse was made by Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report to the failure scandal at the Umbrella Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissening, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication of the German press Agency, he observatory from former Regensburg Bishop and today's cardmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Emeritus Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would have expressed deep regret about their own undertakings or their then false estimation of processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican courts "Osservatore Romano," however, criticized that in the reporting on violence with "two measures" should be measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Nobody knows no one of the attacks in Regensburg, that it would have to be punished by "shameful and shameful actions," but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the accustness, the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal" writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Even Fürstin Gloria by Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we're looking forward to the church and that is a well-known frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "blows a quite normal pedagogical remedy." to be done with cheeky children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who covered the memoir "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Heshemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which was submitted to the author of the diocese of Ulrich Weber with the declaration of education?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 rainy ssparks were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plotism" victim of attacks, 67 domain names sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, so that by Domkapellmeister R., in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even with high Emotions the punishment for the students could also be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other accusations, however, many victims estimates the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore even positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Ezekemann, why the final report about the abuse of the Umbrella Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger would be relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report about the "Incidents of violent insulators in the Umwelsh Domsplash" gives a contradictory picture of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students raise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">To the other, it also appears as cholker and perfectionist, which was not a top performance musically without any top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself more about why the name Georg Ratzinger is coming in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to him just eight sides and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of the Mittal or co-slavery in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The acts of violence at the preschool took place outside of its sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can calleviate him if too late or have taken first proposals to have taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" sincere "" "sincere" "" sincere "" "sincere" "" sincere "" "sincere" "" sincere "," "qualified" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high Emotions, which also lead to twiutches.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he threw himself not only with chairs and threw the keychain on the ground, but also earmarked guys from the hair or ears, he himself has already offended years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, it has to be said that such educational methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widespread in parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced that in a secular school, state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually goes in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and non-violence at the preschool, they are certainly baguas.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You wonder if it's not to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, many media have just thrown on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who never understand him, still eagerly awaited.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report discusses Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media reports in connection with the report very much about the subject of abuse during the Domsburger Domsplash.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also any involvement or co-relationship with regard to sexual abuse on load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: definitely no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted to the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk with my father or mother," said an affectionate representing the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in education of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even feel parents and siblings, certainly not a choral director, who had been a coworist of the perpetrators yet.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the scratch-pupil Ratzinger's role in the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "in regards sexual abuse... I see no case in which he would have had timely reviews (Georg Ratzinger) and could have had the respective offender.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for truly absurd to accept that itself... Buben haunting or clearer or rather reopened as compared to their parents, internals, confidentiality teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report comes to the very clear result: "that we trusted in the apron and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">As regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is saying free of all participation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In this way, it cannot be accused of having hindered him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, a lot of "non-violence" had to be read by the Umbrella Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegner."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything mixed and distorted to a huge milking from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Yet exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Then there is clean separate: between the preschool and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and acts of violence as well as we say, we will once more.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report incidents have been treated from time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the Domsplash.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole dreadful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers have been screened and painted, all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to have dominion.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they had already been on the domain name.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was how the most important witnesses were betting, the subject "preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradigan" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different about the domain registration?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistal violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the end that "many victims estimates the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So it remains at the same time the reproach to have thrown away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself just as well and from the predecessors at a school, which he did not work and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger vanished with the ears consistently?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of theatrium gymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In it he indicates that in the preschool, he continues to be practiced. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press release, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was forbidden as a test punishments in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, like everyone knows us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to see where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatised, and where the permitted border was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say, he always would have stowed away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, schools was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria by Thurn und Taxis claimed to be unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak historians at the "Fallout of Anachronism," i.e. the danger, past according to present moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable to all times, and also not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence to innocent children's points, that goes far beyond practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I'm glad that it will finally be up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplining and punishment, so ear to draw and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment would then be forbidden, he also has stripped himself stricingly.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his rainy day George Ratzinger has played with you for the book "My brother of the Pope."</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of Prüfer to the language also?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI. tells of his perspective, since the Domsplash played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">However, I don't want to know that there was a stricentional regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without these perfectionism, without the unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world transports, true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition, which went equally twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candy alone, one does not even make a big singer and stand before each success in which area but ever discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger on talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I've met Georg Ratzinger really well and again as wonderful, humorous, low-believers and hearted people, from whom you can't imagine that he could only be able to do something a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular contact with how many former cathedral-atzen still today, 23 years after his Emergency, visit him regularly - he's almost blind - and he is almost blind - and like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are so thankful for him that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict father that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to which she still looks up and honour her.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that one throws it, are guardians of education that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unfair, a man, only because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial sinbuck.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, discharged him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the insurgency, a 93-year-old man, who would have acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, perhaps no one would probably know the Regensburg Domspill, finally, finally in peace.</seg>
