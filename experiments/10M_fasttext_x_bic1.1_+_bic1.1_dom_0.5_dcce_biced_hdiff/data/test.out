Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this Hollywood star has now made un@@ mistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; I will always be put in drawers or lying on the outside label , who have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as described in the actual &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
at best , the actress spend their time at home , before TV with pra@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and mexican food , it is in the magazine .
for the whit@@ eness , they bring the question according to the children &apos;s desire : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; so the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child game , &quot; A@@ ni@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid of the pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited some colleagues with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes the horses remembered her solem@@ nity , they pursued at the fast gal@@ lop home to the food .
a few kilometres at this pace , I &apos;m afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the e@@ quest@@ rian career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 victories - once again near horses .
he left his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not let go for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala &apos;s Golden Sports pyramid .
hon@@ ours it does not lack the sympath@@ etic ath@@ lete .
Federal Constitutional Court , Silver , Lor@@ berry leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen left him already .
long is the 18th winner of the pyramid of the pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it will not only be awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he continued to win the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
for the excellent are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ di and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the F@@ us@@ ka Frank Kol@@ be , the ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ ek@@ e , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ ek@@ e , the spr@@ inkl@@ er of Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ book of All Erhard Wonder@@ ful .
many of these athletes were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ ative society w@@ anders into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and tr@@ umps economic policy compared to : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are in tax and energy policy as well as in principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the , on the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep it small in doubt and war@@ ns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to eu@@ v@@ ise the economy and regul@@ ate death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , claims tr@@ ump .
he will rep@@ ay regul@@ ators , and it is strong for an extensive tax reform with lower taxes - for individuals and businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , it says .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
to inv@@ ests in the shots , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ shi@@ ped .
the Democratic Candi@@ date announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ fl@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump could be more part@@ isan discussion .
the differences in energy and climate policies are clear@@ ely .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and the coal extraction in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible in far @-@ protected areas to cancel the Paris climate deal .
Clinton plan to expand the renewable energy with its investment programme , and demands : &quot; one country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only with infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ de @-@ fish agreement , do not want to sign both .
but both the United States don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but only American jobs .
they should also be paid better , Clinton calls for about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a Hung@@ er@@ wages .
it wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump doesn &apos;t want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , The minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says , He must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop into the control policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics observe him before , that the budget deficit would only grow bigger .
Clinton is on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand more taxes , and their critics saying : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every fle@@ dged woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are alone to flee , almost at everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby , which is at the most one year old .
one has laid her small son in his arm .
he looks curious with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ es to the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normally .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the division managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social help in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alised women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no more men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a wax before the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated say : every woman who reaches here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are pursu@@ ing politically because they cause torture or death , or because their families are sending them to Europe , &quot; she says .
in women , others weigh over other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal it secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced , hon@@ our@@ able , slavery or forced pro@@ st@@ itution .
it drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; for example , the tractor call for a bottle of water a sexual action is not a rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , says B@@ ahr .
here too the women in refugee practices would often be considered as inferior and worst case ab@@ used .
this causes approximately 90 percent of women who live in the housing in Munich , is trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily developed . &quot;
many women were so familiar to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
as they often don &apos;t hesitate to help , it simply need more accommodations for her .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
to the question , whether they were using a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with No .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there is no such thing in accommodations of governments .
even in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separated and said Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ cher of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Central Fran@@ ks there are in some common dormitories on floors or their homes only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men .
in a study which has been published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; l@@ acks privacy or men and women together , it can come to - ongoing violence against women . &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separate and accessible to women , stands in the study .
how much women feel this protective need , one can read on the And@@ al@@ ese who gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; since you have been around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily create a second house .
Regist@@ rar Stri@@ kes : demands for New labor disputes
the assist@@ ants have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire Council , from the beginning of September more labour measures to be approved .
the J@@ DC said that it would have given minister to initi@@ ate the wor@@ ries regarding the contract .
Assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed in July on the re@@ jection of a contract with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained steady in case of problems , which led to the agreement that the contract was rejected .
she said , &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official re@@ sign@@ ment to all your concerns . &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labour measures that begin at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the in@@ arians of this year were six@@ ties , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Assist@@ ants of Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back to re@@ jection of the agreed contractual conditions that had been advised by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote of 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be adv@@ an@@ ta@@ geous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the contract for physi@@ cians in England would be a for@@ ci@@ ble .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and an official end of the eight month long lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ part in the g@@ ild@@ ed room of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot defend myself from the ru@@ cks that Ankara wants to be most reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be nar@@ row@@ ly and he is radiant heat , even for its restra@@ ined conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; love friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better .
the next day she described a newspaper that Erdogan would have been so bl@@ ur@@ able than would never happen .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cooling was shown that Russia &apos;s state of affairs had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane to the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ asted .
Putin split and accused Ankara , who fell into the back .
it was even bigger as it was done by a supposed friend .
the Vet@@ ro@@ en re@@ build is difficult , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would have to blame for everything .
on the serious test , the accus@@ ations of senior civil servants , that , had benefited from illegal oil trading in regions of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this thing .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use of President Erdogan , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a sort of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdogan takes first line all friends that he can get after spending last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat nearly of his office .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the pro@@ hibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and Charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resumed .
they count on a late seasonal attraction to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television endor@@ sed fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ ary imports will be allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this way : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , since the response to which tried to take power over weak response .
in addition , the ongoing gro@@ ll will come across the EU &apos;s accession negotiations and Putin - the g@@ out on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , the Russian President won a bonus for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the elected state of state .
it is well @-@ evident for Moscow to understand self @-@ understanding that himself has a deep sitting in front of regim@@ es .
the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace of the sea allowed it Russia and Turkey , one as it described me a analy@@ st , &quot; alliance of out@@ sider &quot; : two countries who viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel po@@ or@@ ly treated and now al@@ lied on .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave up the role as Nobel Peace , but where Russia and Turkey support oppos@@ ites .
it could be significant that after nearly three hours of first calls both President responded to the press conference that they would not even have invaded the subject .
the president of Turkey deliber@@ ately rep@@ lied on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize it .
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus on where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster than NATO member of Turkey , it is certainly better that the two leaders will talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland are no longer available
according to the Board of Staff , R@@ BS has to be reduced to a back@@ office part according to the Board of Directors .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand had merged with the global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has changed since then , when she had to be almost collapsed and saved eight years ago .
in this time brand names &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other consumer finance brands .
it supported international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to move more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , head office and the IPO are exchanged to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other brands for private clients that get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be employed to our investor brand , as well as to the brand , under which our employees will be busy , as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
now , I say that we are not pursu@@ ing any global goals , but local objectives .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own congregations , and our employees will work with these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the convenience of various brands in its Sport @-@ Sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the brands of brands , as we are asked inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chairman of the Board of Directors .
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double by New@@ market , which brings to him 3@@ .000@@ ten profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured his 3@@ .000@@ ten British gain at New@@ market on Friday .
he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ des , on his local circuit with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Doug Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who had won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy about it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot , it &apos;s a mund@@ ane Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers , when he gets the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ys@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 diamonds
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few before it met him .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that differs from the other in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusi@@ ast@@ ically enthusi@@ ast@@ ically for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago in Ep@@ som that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 winn@@ ings if he would not only be a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has had a winner in the UK for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British flat race for two decades .
it was annoying .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ab@@ bot .
three years ago he had difficulty in the beginning , when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to beat his two fl@@ yers and to return to his top .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his minimum of 50@@ .@@ ten years .
Russia &apos;s Russian President Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has illeg@@ itim@@ ate his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years of close contact with Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special commission for environmental and transport affairs .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is said that Putin was ordered with his duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been the representative since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo embassy .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website it is called ( in Russian ) that later he later was a protocol of protocol and staff of government officials .
regarding his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of law for legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his success@@ ors .
do the ridi@@ culous faces convince ?
this step has been mysterious in Moscow .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the most eng@@ aging trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for the Soviet secret services , K@@ GB .
he was one of the migh@@ ti@@ est men of the country .
during a meeting with President Putin who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was re@@ signed at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once glorified as an potential president would lead to the Russian environmental policy - pushed on large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin who are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I had asked you in early 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated item - you could almost say - compl@@ aining of four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
before that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal War Crimes Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed as his deputy .
as Putin addressed the power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people who trusted most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov might have been President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , since a third reign of Putin could viol@@ ate the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later .

engineers have connected the northern deck of Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 weights .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown had a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go down from the land to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings .
we are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic degree with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closing between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate work that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fitting .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge in their place and the last section of de@@ cks today will receive a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck today , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure is the pione@@ ering high@@ - and deep @-@ building .
after the installation of the last street cover and the connection with the north @-@ country deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land side .
this was reached by pulling the North Cape bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , it weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of approximately 3 % .
he@@ ats up because the toler@@ ances that the team were working , were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters .
luckily everything went very well .
res@@ cu@@ ing in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
three men have been lucky enough to be life , &quot; after they were thrown out of her fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim in safety while their boat continued moving out of their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already woven the boat out of their reach , until we left in water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a boy@@ ant without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have died un@@ hurt and still alive .
although the boat engine had a stop clo@@ g , it dis@@ b@@ anded at the cre@@ ators of the boat off the person who contributed the boat .
someone has weighed about those men today .
seriously injured - man stands out on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police concluded , the 50 year old had given the key to the flat to bring his personal things .
instead , the soft perpet@@ rators cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when they came to the apartment , he put twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and in the body .
the police fired the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ arm@@ oured then his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her partner from the house .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women ro@@ asted the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old gave his sister to her side and attacked his ex @-@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and the Green states mean : investors want to be taken into a lot stronger in the future .
how do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; hand concept living &quot; to the next meeting .
yet stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost , it &apos;s about the question : who should actually build the favorable apartment ?
one regulation is lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments can , however , also be in stock .
the great conflict in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you plan investors to build up on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban residential construction program , which will cost millions of cost and fin@@ anci@@ ally financed , should provide inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left still wants to use hardness requirements for investors .
regardless of what is , Brat@@ mann , a dis@@ appearance of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
yet the program is not entirely different : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of further 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning political speaker Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the town .
in addition , it would have to be thought that apartments back to the price connection .
this is possible in the western city .
on a blow I could solve the problem .
for the western part , the dead@@ lines run out .
around 1800 apartments could be taken back in the price connection for cheap apartments .
only : this will not want the owners , the apartment companies .
because the number of social apartments in the western city has been increased dramatically , the target of the so @-@ called flow rate .
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbor@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be any movement in discussion .
S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke means : &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU comes with the boat . &quot;
the focus was concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child for playing no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens at rigid , was su@@ ed in the last decade of many .
in Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it is about to bring people out of the sofa and become more active .
at the beginning , the screen was on the TV set , then on video games and lastly on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not open to each other .
I &apos;m looking forward to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later arose from a animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sun@@ k the interest in the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was moved by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon go more users than inks , and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphone outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; can be captured .
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the wreck and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that re@@ jects the &quot; average &quot; of every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , shared the number of people &apos;s launch in two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes , who jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data for performance .
many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring it &quot; to take &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to be &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the importance of sport can not be reviewed .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances to ill cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of benefits that too long is to lead them here .
but the wonderful of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that there will bring people to do something in the open , making them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ g game destro@@ ying that must always complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should I do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports , as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and let it be used with time .
however , due to poker success , there will be more games to get the apps and virtual reality with the active will be combined in the real world and so many people are going to hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in women &apos;s mou@@ ths
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all of you .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the floor .
set great on all the line .
and now the Olympic champion finally arrived .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; Mann@@ er@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal from Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans are Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig @-@ bar during the individual campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ class struggle and a total of the fifth , while it soli@@ di@@ fies its reputation , the best of its generation or even ever .
she broke out in tears when her final score was shown and her long journey found an end .
this success makes them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated the sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , which is awarded a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on from her said she was &quot; the best gymn@@ ast in which I ever saw . &quot;
it was a last review in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered as dis@@ appointment .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace change after they have won gold and silver in the single multi@@ polar govern@@ ance of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es took the first medal in Tuesday while she was co @-@ ordin@@ ated by Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i retired on the farewell celebration .
although Bil@@ es in@@ sist@@ ed on the top of her long departure , never the future is planned , it &apos;s not really true .
part of its ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is based on Latin American music , which would fit into the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child adopted and discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , was trained in the ground floor .
it has not lost any more competition competition since the summer of 2013 , a victory series that will hold so long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina easily managed by two moves , the picture sm@@ ashed .
Swedish king and Bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es continues the world championship title - l@@ ur@@ ned .
she again repeated 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig @-@ bar again - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently to her grand@@ parents - a pure form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed in bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision , which she once described in her collecting book , became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a depth of Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old teams of men had called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans .
after their ground practice , she threw the audience with the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as regards Bil@@ es , the twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers killed in a car in a car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who have died in one of the le@@ thal attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ers of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while on the side of the car was standing and fled , afterwards with another vehicle , is to be read in the report .
the police part@@ ed that the triple murder did not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were owned by an adult victims .
the police pre@@ cher of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the investig@@ ator had been conducting the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , nine attacks were killed in nine attacks within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it is in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disc@@ lose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and perpet@@ rated by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died even on the spot .
a witness divided the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty Pick@@ up truck before the three @-@ time murder and assumed that it was the factory of the mass mur@@ ders .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the fe@@ west of his age , Edmund Mikro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home first time , my first thought was , I didn &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create it .
I did not let myself leave .
what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left out of course , &quot; she said .
husband Vincent and her husband told you that Edmund may never know them under circumstances and that he may not survive once .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto .
Edmund can run with help from a help remedy .
Edmund could neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year old , nor can he yet speak .
but it is making steady progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which Edmund Optics for &quot; Please sing something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring to him drawing language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but it is not typical drawing language -- she says . Edmund invented some characters alone .
Mikro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early , as it will affect the life of infected infected infected with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked about the progn@@ osis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that anyone can really say .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers from babies with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it gets better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding give cause rescue in Louisiana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ all and large floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the Governor to procla@@ im the emergency stand on Friday . it will be closed all Saturday more with more rain falls .

ste@@ ele said that the church of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa should have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags alone .
a flood warning system is used across long parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches in the rain could be incur@@ red in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a fl@@ ut@@ ory system was deployed on Friday , while mobile continued to continue in the field of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite in the vicinity Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will reach a record level of all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood for over the weekend .
the Met@@ ric Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many houses in the offices of nearby Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream floods in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , because these rivers only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the River Bo@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi National border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams are still growing people out of flood waters in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved near Glo@@ ster , on Friday .

in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , nearly two dozens of roads were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the residents that are hoping to hold water from their homes and shops .
&quot; the last major flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the case manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ess said that it continued to rain at the Gulf Coast .
according to his figures , a hand@@ ful of properties will be reported on Thursday and were not reported on Friday until now .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I introduce myself to the Women Olympics in Tur@@ nen and this from more than one reason .
first of all , since 1984 I joined the Summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &apos;s &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Catholic is round , makes everyone proud .
this crew finally reflects the US .
it has de@@ fied the black and H@@ isp@@ anic feminine presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one amongst female singers was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this is showing strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible power of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were un@@ expect@@ edly , but master@@ ful gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ic@@ rout@@ inen .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual criminal event for women .
crew member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but look at gym classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way like A@@ ly and Madison , to make it an Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality sees that Tur@@ nen is a expensive sport and Turner first place in private gy@@ ms , who are maintained by parents for training , furnishing , travel clothing , compet@@ iti@@ veness and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ ast@@ ics lie in weal@@ thy suburbs which can support the business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts received all their training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ ee of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained her athletes since they started with the Tur@@ nen .
we have to be inspired by the municip@@ alities Au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easier access training .
I founded my gym for 20 years .
in my events we have both free and affordable gymn@@ ast in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics that earn the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
tur@@ nes develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that thousands of young girls are interested in interested in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this true portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team Mongo@@ l and thank you , so many young girls motiv@@ ate with different background to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant denti@@ sts want to organize further strikes after Jerem@@ y Dog proposal rejected proposal
the ministers had hoped to termin@@ ate the argument by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ .000 assist@@ ants who vote in a choice , declined .
in July , Hunt plans reveal the contract to adopt the contract , and said that the N@@ HS had been in@@ sist@@ ed in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would have had any further delay for the employees and patients .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend packages to improve the care of the working hours .
DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Com@@ mentary Committee for assist@@ ants shared last night in a communication with : &quot; Assist@@ ants to heat up serious concerns , in particular that it will heat up the current staff rise and bring it to treat all physi@@ cians . &quot;
with only eight weeks left , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve the dispute by talks during the government on the contra@@ diction to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
that happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hunt had just made it last month , that his door would always open up .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt needs to act now , lifting up the condition and address the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are ready to carry further labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of almost 13@@ ,000 routines and 100,000 termin@@ ations , as nur@@ ses and specialists have been involved in order to give doctors on the strike string cover .
the ministers had hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes through an acceptance of the re@@ formed Treaty by the functioning of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better weekly re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employee , asked the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labor disputes achieve nothing of the only little , but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , care and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the Department of Assist@@ ants and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries had a positive response to the concerns of the atri@@ um and W@@ hist@@ c@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that this continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as post@@ ing , flexibility during training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ricul@@ um , education , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ricul@@ um , training courses and the Ministry of Health regarding the observ@@ ance of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
£ 2 @-@ per day medicine , which can lower heart attacks
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 per day drug , after being advised by the authorities to give it more people for a longer period of time .
the od@@ or@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulation system has recommended a four @-@ year long in@@ gest@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation system has recommended a four @-@ year long in@@ gest@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by ass@@ ump@@ tions of fatty materials in the arter@@ ial walls that form the pads .
when the Bel@@ ag breaks apart , it can cause blood flow to clo@@ gged the blood flow up to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots loose , it can flow through blood flow and clo@@ gged the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack , subject to a higher risk to have another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ ec@@ a and is distributed under the Bri@@ li@@ que trade name , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the call design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health insurance company said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reduction of other heart attacks and strokes in people who had already a heart attack .
due to a provisional recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft bill does not recommend any treatment that goes beyond this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ess raises election fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption from the office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tal has led to a widespread electoral commission could be ignored in Muslim communities such as a devast@@ ating government report .
the former Cab@@ inet Council Sir Eric Pic@@ kles calls us the police to observe election ob@@ servers and coun@@ cils for evidence of abuse of abuse on eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption sc@@ aling , said that it should be allowed to allow the police to be allowed to set off tapes outside of pol@@ ls , to protect pen@@ sion@@ ers .
he recommends that voters should lead a ID card to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a v@@ oter must only name his name and address .
the report proposes not to remove any remove ink on a person &apos;s finger , if it im@@ pe@@ de its constitu@@ ency to prevent one twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , Sir Eric says .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official meetings or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election line than in the east of London .
last year , a special selection court ruled that the current mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be named after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his Am@@ tes .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; and that he would have put his critics to silence with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis to choose the religious duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either desper@@ ate or the consequence of an im@@ itation , if someone cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the country .
he especially expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent let@@ tering - at the older members of the Muslim community have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the joining of ways to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof that pressure was administered to needy members of some ethnic min@@ orities , especially women and young people in order to vote in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Lebanese background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activ@@ ist documents should work , to stop &quot; voting . &quot;
the report that is drawn from Ther@@ esa May is also asked to prevent tough@@ er registration checks in order to prevent the electoral directory for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options in regard to question voters in front of your choice .
do not use remote ink on the finger of a person as soon as she sends her voice to prevent one twice cho@@ oses .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on mot@@ ions to an automatic post@@ election .
pro@@ hibition that political activists process full post @-@ elections and env@@ elop@@ es of letters .
the police give the power to set off shut@@ ters for electoral stations .
a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Law Act 1983 ) .
photographer displac@@ ed in electoral stations .
requirements that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that employees commit the rule , that voters go alone to the electoral cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his representative for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as in@@ separable . &quot; he said .
due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty as a result of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; Ab@@ shar@@ k controls &quot; of the constitu@@ encies of the Rath@@ eh@@ ouse .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
our country as the mother of parliament is a proud heir , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of election fraud and den@@ ig@@ ation of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

fans of the Rio Olympics 2016 in Rio are advised that this week &apos;s French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , besides rim and band , proved to be an impressive double victory of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to have gold fighters who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you can give the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are running on our screens , F@@ email has created a lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood as famous .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from the dou@@ bts on the bicycle race track many people have referred to the internet , like a certain bow of the dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused an ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the archers hit the mad@@ ness of the social media , and gave him to hear that he had already been like Leo .
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , except for the facial hairy , &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post shared .
&quot; he is a hand@@ some guy , so I summar@@ ise it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the up@@ lifting simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ ra Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her great , expres@@ sive eyes should be able to go through the Cuban American singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the Gle@@ e Star Morrison years .
one speed higher : this is the view that Nathan is the &quot; ath@@ letic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another half comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and A@@ ctor Jos@@ h , which has similar eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal floating in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sunny skin and blonde hair such as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan &apos;s name was attacked by fans , a &quot; ath@@ letic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a t@@ witter @-@ user was very happy about others also like the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter username explained that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope is solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have incredibly similar facial form and eyes .

a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she re@@ lied again and the business left without buying something . &quot;
she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled their own strings and tro@@ users and tast@@ ed them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a dis@@ counted place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she re@@ signed the under@@ pants , which you obviously did not like to put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that you did not like anything to re@@ bound himself and went out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that someone was watching or think about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; As regards someone who would take under@@ pants with home , who had an other person and had not been washed . &quot;

how to protect arms from arms attacks against Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move about distance with armed inc@@ ers .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ ber .
if you are approached from the back , then you should be able to turn your att@@ ack@@ ers so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and &quot; go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
grab your gun then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
beat him then with the knee into the strip and turn the weapon out of pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
att@@ ack@@ ers , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , grab the weapon and rotate it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time you re@@ locate the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his handle before moving backwards and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ dictive .
but remember that at a prey on the saf@@ est , your money is too rich - unless you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .

before dro@@ pping each object , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to show and let us show what he is going on .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stri@@ th , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought to wi@@ pe the pur@@ ging button of a tractor toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely dis@@ gust@@ ing , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
luckily left nothing , he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right has been known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by going through the world and ate pec@@ uli@@ ar and wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations to r@@ ushing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task set its immune system definitely under a sample
he told the film : &quot; already as a kid I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was justified in his reputation .
the only thing that he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ be@@ zel showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to ref@@ ine after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands showed one of less than 60 .
Mr W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner &apos; Stri@@ th , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; this comes to the worst thing I got stuck in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing cleaner than that !
I will not lick up here , because it is a sol@@ itary one here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stri@@ th &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that &apos;s fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by which we sent &quot; L@@ ass us to call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ts , said : &quot; let me say it so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , when he would have tast@@ ed some of the things I have instructed him , like the ec@@ lipse Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian , to lick it and others , with which it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey carried out by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents were involved in particular with the well@@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent , that they may use at least occasionally products that contain l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ation Social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ cial family left their social dwelling after a delay with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they had terror@@ ized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were viol@@ ently removed from their property , there was a sho@@ cking staff of housing corpor@@ ations in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls are ens@@ ing holes on , wooden panels were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family were moved and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said they were not afraid to repair the apartment .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute mare for the people here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is also not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the flat in the meantime and the police told that the terror that had joined the family , strug@@ gles with bas@@ eball bat , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug stores and excessive scre@@ aming .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demolished under circumstances , old garbage was found
they were found in the property where drugs were traded on drugs called wood panels .
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to be called by police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ etes her and her partner viol@@ ently from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to educ@@ ate them voluntarily .
Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours , so they said that their life was made to hell .
one thing said , &quot; They were not ashamed . &quot;
we lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we are talking about the police are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not usual !
now , where they are gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager from Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have been given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years .
on the superior side of the house house tr@@ ash and old toys was thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that it is a shame to adopt the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as a delay is always the last step into account by Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
that was a very difficult case , since the behaviour was extremely long and their deeds should be horri@@ ble for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have approached us and have given us the information .
I hope this development is don@@ ating some neighbors , and the message convey@@ s that ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but they are all over 20 .
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ ing on the ground .
workers of the country office will now have to dig@@ n a garbage dump which surround the house
in 2014 , police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine of fine after they had found guilty of the possession of a class B in trading fore@@ sight .
they claimed that the money was for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner is now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that they will del@@ im@@ itate ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row , by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , shared a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior who continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Ma Long in a Own League for Table Tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympics .

this was clear that for the third time , a Chinese Chinese title would pick up a Chinese title in the sign of five rings .
last Non @-@ Chinese member on the top Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate alone , between sentences and time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they had with@@ drawn at the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; I played the Mat@@ ches until now I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finals I play for me , Z@@ hang was fol@@ ly said .
after the game , gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .

Donald Tr@@ ump is dre@@ aming of tremendous problems in the campaign
the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , including traditionally conservative federal states .
Donald Tr@@ ump gave up weakness of his presidential campaign in the previous rep@@ ubli@@ can strongh@@ old Utah .
a rare moment , in which the m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ ons usually seemed to express something like any concerns , expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after he has thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own rep@@ ubli@@ can camp , doubt the doubt of his success in the fight for White House .
&quot; we have immense problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians that he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
to blame be false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resumed his known media s@@ add@@ les .
rep@@ ubli@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ gen w@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a secure bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ ition@@ ist from the demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are usual for rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates .
at risk , Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as he would stop to stop Clin@@ tons . &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
and whether afterwards , &quot; I will be &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t do anything else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
if it does not end for him in the end of political correc@@ t@@ ness , it is okay , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I turned back to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party Tr@@ ump is said to under@@ line funds to support his campaign , he should not present better question@@ able values .
instead of being able to control the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than the arms taking place .
Olympia : Dre@@ ams Sc@@ am with D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar commission .
Ken@@ yan athletes threat@@ ens after the second d@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
Kenya sent a trainer to his home after a d@@ oping attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village .
the International Olympic Committee stated that a disciplinary Commission will respond promptly to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary said that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah at the Olympic Village was given a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this has been reported by the team management Ken@@ yan from the D@@ oping controllers .
the German association IA@@ AF has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case to ex@@ ert own exam@@ inations , a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the analysis and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an evaluation &quot; called it in an IA@@ AF Declaration .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and issued itself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the Trial and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ yan head de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was owned by the Ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes who stood on the list for training control of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich has turned over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ letics Assembly , Michael Rot@@ ich has been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
it is said to have informed about cash payments in his country on offensive d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly be arrested by his return at the airport of Nairobi .
in Kenya , IO@@ C has been under special observation for the IO@@ C after numerous d@@ oping clubs .
at the announcement of the IO@@ C more than 2000 d@@ oping target control in front of the Rio games was not unusual before@@ hand , that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into the visor .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had put a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start .
subsequently , WA@@ DA Kenia took part in the list of countries whose d@@ oping fight con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
for the athletes of the country won most of the medals in the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reporting the ARD was raised again , that in Kenya &apos;s d@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
Richard Po@@ und has asked for a similar study in Kenya as he had appointed them in the Russian World Ath@@ letics .
thereby it could be proven that in this sport area nation@@ wide and systematically sub@@ merged .
Russian athletes have subsequently been exp@@ elled from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presented the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director , Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ el@@ an artist Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a older Mary .
she re@@ members the gro@@ aning of her lovers with Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character I have as a tube , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the Opera : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
she is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in any of his movements , in his ga@@ ze , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a very southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the buff@@ ers went to New York , and they did not want to go to New York .
they are the same themes , and they are as well as meaningful as then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

Turkey : Kurdish church reck@@ ons with mass cav@@ ities
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdogan is att@@ acking , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish municipality in Germany will soon expect tens of thousands of protection seeking out from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; believes the Supreme Leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish Church of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass ev@@ asion to Germany .
&quot; in short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium term , with some hundred thousand protection seeking out of Turkey in Germany , if the Erdogan regime is fighting the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the Commission president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k in the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had passed the Kurdish high bur@@ ners with Stra@@ fak@@ tions , 500,000 Kurds have been on the run within Turkey .
after the tur@@ key coup , the sec@@ ular and op@@ positioning of ethnic Turks would add .
many will want to start in Europe when they are going to be op@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state who raises refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k .
chief of staff compl@@ ained to Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ itarian towns .
thereby Erdogan would raise the pressure to the left Kurds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been er@@ adi@@ cated or sold in the last hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also an CDU member .
the Chief of Staff urged that the Federal Government will be &quot; as sharp as Austria &apos;s position against Erdogan and his followers . &quot;
in Germany , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; is held against Erdogan critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also feared the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and opposition .

as reported by the newspaper , by calling on figures from the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks occupied the largest group of political persecution of asylum in Germany before Put@@ sch .
at the reporting date June 30 , this 11,@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all rights have been recognised ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives do not receive anything from the summer campaign with - and holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not vote on the parliament .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 the daily election will not be held once again at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land@@ rush era - it bit@@ es itself .
the natives , who are to be convinced by the fighters , are on vacation .
most tourists who are in the country are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen , or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no locals , so do not vote on the country &apos;s day .
these are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers are wind up , distribut@@ ing ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers and end votes .
until 4 September 2016 , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to drop once again a campaign for election with the election and final election day .
the hot phase when you can say that at all has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now clear in pol@@ ls behind the CDU .
exciting is how strong new@@ com@@ er AF@@ D cuts and what remains to the end of coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 government of government , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from its major posters .
he travels through the country , spread out ro@@ ses , and chat a little with the people , as it already did his legendary advoc@@ ate predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors got cold feet and is Chancellor Merkel the debt of AF@@ D .
their refugee policy , &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with their nick@@ name data , the Minister of Defense Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place .
she has invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to grand@@ daughter ; Merkel parliament is located in the north east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; Sarah Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but it is no one to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel listen .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast of the CDU comes largely on market@@ places and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
thus , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union also noted that you cut off the base on the ground that it has to be very strict , again to find a wire to people .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly available in the areas of the country .
however , the council of the CDU @-@ presidential army Kok@@ ert is self @-@ declar@@ ing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts where people are : Dor@@ othy , Golden weddings , each birthday party has to be used . &quot;
because a lot has stood on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD as a particularly dedicated campaign .
in surveys the social demo@@ cr@@ ats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and just close to AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD still gained an impression of 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small part@@ isan , with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should have the leap into the parliament .
they make a modern virtu@@ e of holiday , and disc@@ ard its campaign to the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it is the president of Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green don@@ ors go on sp@@ ur@@ ensu@@ e to domestic stim@@ uli among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ ist lakes and finds it even beautiful .
their impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about speed , with which the B 27 is renovated .
the works were responsible for the works of construction , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning , and end only at 20 o &apos;clock .
&quot; they made all pretty sh@@ aky , &quot; El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the building site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the beginning of October , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the opposite will also be praised to work , for example when it comes to the establishment of heating drives .
since the building site moved to the south on Monday and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ einf@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was abolished and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation within the resort was relaxed .
the citizens can now return from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic flows through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were partly considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the Deputy Head of the Deputy Head of the Director Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths seeking and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age .
what led to some trucks lost in residential areas .
as well as the speed limit@@ ing were not kept , the church increasingly urged to sing the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable trans@@ gres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself a location on the location itself .
two to three per minute were born .
the quick@@ est way was on the way at 77 km in pace in the pace of the pace .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for business people at the B 27 , it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the street is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 renovation led to the sales of the B 27 , each one asks you to look through .
however some are some more and some less affected .
who has less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; so for other firms , the rehabilitation have hardly any consequences .
also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight decline , &quot; but also , of course , &quot; the imp@@ etus is missing . &quot;
the local along the road are most explo@@ ited .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ent .
not only him , but all the restaurants have met &quot; hard . &quot;
we were missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be glad about every Euro turnover .
the sales revenue was reduced to &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot;
the street saw his operation &quot; back for two years . &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss half of his staff .
if I had a firm of 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt acted on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if it could provide a financial compensation , otherwise it benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now they also read the dis@@ advantages caused by the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows about other regions where something generous was handled .
in all suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his host will continue to pass .
after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
other common guests can now see less often because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t travel , it &apos;s elsewhere nice too .
that his ancest@@ or has returned to the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no dou@@ bts about it .
despite the crises of BSE and a bird flu G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in their long history .
six months construction work , this is already brutal .
constantly in the name of counter @-@ terrorism will be screwed to laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
all of his proposals are politically vulner@@ able to the coalition , says the Minister of domestic ministers on the performance of his new safety package .
they are looking for no one .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I &apos;m also bet@@ ting on it too .
but as Minister of Interior , however , it is located on results and in a &quot; cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has taken a little time , before he presented its conclusions for the security of the Republic .
but now they all fall into the more extensive .
some is already known , announ@@ cing that a new security authority should take care of encrypted communications , is not new .
not the fact that Germany needs to implement multiple EU requirements for passenger data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities does not come un@@ expect@@ edly .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second start for proposals which have not been made with the SPD : he wants to put the sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still kept this for reasonable and demands nothing , which has no chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also .
it is partly in itself : it plans quick printing process for deport@@ ations and more possibilities to arrest people from deportation .
refugees who targeted targeted to the country should check their smartphone in advance and place social media accounts for a safety check .
for some exp@@ atri@@ ots for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put some more badly than ever - such , the off@@ ences , or deliber@@ ately throw away their papers to wear their identity .
some of them is politically and legally .
some even seem un@@ balanced and is open to questions .
and for some points - with the ine@@ quality of toler@@ ances for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be understood that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg have been refugees .
many people also worry about security at the high number of refugees .
and things that people are deeply impressed by the people , did not let him go out in election times .
the inner safety is stretched enorm@@ ously in the focus .
first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the pollution is great .
and yes , there are choices .
the Union and the SPD can thus increasingly lead to internal security .
in the past few days there went high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ant@@ y dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons of Interior Minister , in which the Ress@@ orts also call for a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère goes also here to reconc@@ ile notes .
from a double @-@ pass he doesn &apos;t hold anything .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
they re@@ produce , be not meaningful .
and with a bur@@ ka @-@ pro@@ hibition he has constitutional objec@@ tions .
whether his own package is in@@ constitutional to all the corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , only has to show itself .
there is a lot of things that could provide for dispute .
the SPD , however , is currently trying to pro@@ filing the inner safety .
Part@@ en@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel is not sign@@ alized only once more careful and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety . &quot;
even Volkswagen will not help you through .
despite diesel engines the distribution numbers rise worldwide .
but it does not run in all markets .
on the recall action there are vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen launches ship@@ ments to deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s largest automobile manufacturer can prove to a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the core brand was weaker , especially in Western Europe , making it st@@ akes its overall sales as the company ha@@ sted in the D@@ ax .
the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles worldwide in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , the deliveries are almost a six @-@ sixth .
head office CEO Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the weaker numbers from July , particularly on two sales days less in Europe .
moreover , in some core markets , &quot; modified economic conditions &quot; have given &quot; a department restra@@ int . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the EU suffered from the EU , explained a spokesperson .
in the United States , where the exhaust f@@ issu@@ ing was first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to be@@ ech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected land@@ marks of Lower Saxony is further observ@@ able by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.9 % to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is in be@@ ech .
in January to July , Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales spl@@ itter from January to July .
Volkswagen supplied a 1.3 percent more vehicles sold in this period , 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manip@@ ulated with a software .
in Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million cars for upgra@@ ding into the workshops .
during the re@@ arm@@ ament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no adverse effects .
after upgra@@ ding the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
after upgra@@ ding a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate from the client , the client is not speaking , but I don &apos;t speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel .
the reason are legal enemy .
the &quot; Focus &quot; reported that Volkswagen was now offering its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models .
this would have been confirmed on the last Monday VW @-@ Repres@@ ent@@ atives in the Federal Foreign Office .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; Volkswagen has fully met the regulations of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this will not be accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that the fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the upgrade no deteri@@ or@@ ations take place and all type relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was to be in corporate travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage they have nothing to do with the permission of any warranty , as it was .
therefore , VW use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ alties of pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany .
on Thursday , Bank@@ boss Josef Paul said : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers to park 40 million euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ time . &quot;
the Bundes@@ verband German banks is talking about a single incident and does not see the signal : normal savings would have to be afraid to pay for their austerity penalty . &quot;
to store banks over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you must pay a 0.4 per cent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ time accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul .
he por@@ ted over a time of 40 million euros , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to another , and could not be verified .
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; said the ban@@ ker .
&quot; I can &apos;t put € 4,000 for each million . &quot;
the cost will now continue after the caus@@ al principle .
if cash is easy to leave in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank &apos;s v@@ aults , it would be too dangerous : &quot; I haven &apos;t seen four cases , I would not like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank@@ note .
most clients have been comprehen@@ sible and changed to other assets .
only a few emigrated to other banks .
the financial association of Bavaria declared : &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable cost in all banks . &quot;
they alone carry , be &quot; business @-@ economically permanently not possible . &quot;
some German banks therefore raised their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with interest rates for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ wer@@ - and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank had made head@@ lines with their indoor sk@@ ate bank in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , managing director of the banking industry , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay private clients to pay for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , &quot; on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ ele which is equipped with a little sum@@ p@@ tuous . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; if they are free of charge .
founded in 1911 , the Co@@ operative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ sters , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

the President of the Federation of German People of People and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negative is very high , very high . &quot;

Dest@@ ination records : who is buying records ?
lonely men love middle aged plates .
before you hur@@ ry to comment under the p@@ seudonym , not to so@@ w them under a p@@ seudonym , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the versatile recovery of sound plates doesn &apos;t want to go to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the news from physical objects but to Mid@@ life @-@ Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have purchased a record recently are all fore@@ sight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des through Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional significance . older flat runners maintain their feelings more ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the findings of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I carry out a humble street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest ho@@ und@@ ant , before I stop , my hands keep my hands and something serious : &quot; so , let us look at a close look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of S@@ oh@@ os has moved slowly to his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were based - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I had sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill a few hours .
is he a collector I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
this record , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy items that he had sold , when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I had probably been too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he &apos;s right to those who buy plates , more intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I smoke not and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my truck .
GMT , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , believes that many customers apply to meet You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and promp@@ ted to buy their old records .
of the convers@@ ations that I have led , people usually have to empty their collection as a rule in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy again their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a store like Phon@@ ica to realise that record shops offering a soothing community of par@@ ables .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to get back to the stability of familiar sound shells , from objects which give happy attention .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or ownership of materials poss@@ essions than any kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that &apos;s about me as collectors and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; red@@ dish an employee from a stack of stack .
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people bought a record for the last month they haven &apos;t been heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use while 7 % of those who buy one plate , no turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I pu@@ zz@@ led through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Scot@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data : three men middle ages ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone first came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a radio ead , so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more production loads , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table . &quot;
these are younger people , not older they come out slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the record records almost a whole floor , has a pale audience when I clean .
there are pairs of 70 , tourists , the photos make , teen@@ ager and women of middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of latest syn@@ thesizer and experiment pop instead of experimental jazz bo@@ asting from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks strange but relatively short psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ach if you stand for someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale .
she rather makes a sh@@ ov@@ ary glo@@ bet@@ e than a big purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , therefore , collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a love gro@@ wer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of record holder is supposed to have inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .

French Court Re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
in a hearing treat@@ ise this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the state should be entitled to sell 72 provisional shops within the camp commodities , from cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel business , of which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and the risk of fire .
humanitarian groups divided the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by the nation@@ ally supported union and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in stock .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the as@@ signing of people who operate the 72 provisional business , but spati@@ ally that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are absolutely trace@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food stores , cafes , and restaurants would play much more important than just people living in extreme pre@@ ventive conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that were threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is generally profitable and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum seek@@ ers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in stock .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er will focus on the next @-@ generation speed monitor : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which are particularly effective to perform Tem@@ pos@@ ing .
the futur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used in case of accidents , where it would be dangerous for mobile measuring through the police .
for example , on highway building sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary tempo , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary gl@@ itter for compliance with speed limit@@ ing .
a durable mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts five days , the case data will be transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be recorded over several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limit and transit connections to time , drivers and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the advanced state , the trailer can move by car with trailer h@@ itch .
in order to not simply be cl@@ oned off , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the pan @-@ pan and the outer shell swe@@ ets disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the Bl@@ itzer from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic to various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash@@ es with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces after placing an order of 150 units last year .
great Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ he Rug@@ by , after Fiji Tab@@ ulated Gold .
the impressive performance of Britain with 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fiji shared a master class in the handling , side step@@ pes , desc@@ ending , liner , and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic @-@ ed@@ aille of any color .
the defeat was vers@@ ed by the non @-@ bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they fought in New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the bo@@ k , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall on it in the final .
but regardless of this , Fiji had sm@@ itten with this form a 15 @-@ man team in the top form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a gold medal will hang up a gold medal for tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England of Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult road behind him .
eight years ago , they lost among Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this loop will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began to be wonderful and let the attacks go from fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. run as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au came in the corner .
with an even four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i put another attack on the right hand , which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly set the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a third goal of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa . &quot;
in the seventh minute of J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch@@ down and it stood at 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ acc@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ bred by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the pause .
it &apos;s so as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while the UK is still in se@@ eded .
it is that way .
GB made basic changes to half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favour of the South African cons@@ ular whose fans sank and danced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i t@@ ittle in one more attempt in the last seconds .
the wh@@ ist@@ le rang the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB kno@@ cked down completely in the grass .
earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain pushed South Africa into a half @-@ final match of the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks back to the front , but Dan N@@ orton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ ing and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ old team secured the profit - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fight with the cancer of the train@@ ee to the rowing victory
there will be no fan of an engine than with these games , and that &apos;s what we want .
from the first rowing period to the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve which enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra importance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio del Lag@@ oa .
even though it were only those who were sitting on the rod , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ee Robin Williams , was more present than they laid the second Olympic champion in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports which gave such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter was un@@ worthy , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lete , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of Triumph .
behind every gold in the rowing a batt@@ al@@ ion found a b@@ ion on the willing hel@@ pers that make the difference and it was no one of the trainer , who didn &apos;t know if he would survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he is ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do this , he spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the season , what the inter@@ ruption was to a minimum , if that is the correct term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so it soon had to go better .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
this is how it begins .
rowing on itself is already a challenge , but it makes it a bigger one .
in the in@@ accur@@ ability of the victory their first thoughts came to Williams , who had a ner@@ ved morning to talk something more than anything else , trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I said this week an emotional wreck . that might be something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore , a massive thanks go to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have wished for better person or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with whom their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark have taken up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were caught very well at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process . &quot; stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get caught up .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make something rab@@ ies .
we wanted no fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventure of Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity
the CEO of the Aqu@@ it@@ ational Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes to retirement .
the association is considered &quot; Bavaria . &quot;
a small spru@@ ce drinking water - model for the large water producers .
so it was some time ago in the original alt@@ on in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum was replaced by the Government of Lower Fran@@ ks .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ed group sailed to &quot; Bavarian &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twin @-@ association staff , 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with the headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants every year .
member states are the congregations of Kirch@@ em , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach .
for more cities and communities there are water suppliers .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ns &apos;s Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , re@@ minded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as water @-@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed as CEO of the Special Pur@@ pose in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks are very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance operations , the bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency exchange on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high reservoir ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ purchase of a central computer management ( 2004 ) and the sharing of water@@ pipes .
it did not have a stand@@ still and has always been added to innovations because water lives and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio , she pra@@ ising G@@ öl@@ ler faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used himself with a lot of heart attacks for his water purpose , and he managed to regul@@ ate the purpose of the water as it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he served as a true practition@@ er to present the bro@@ ader concept of the bro@@ k@@ age group in front of the water@@ forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken District .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller lob@@ ulated g@@ rie@@ bel Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together for 28 years with him .
he is the best water al@@ keeper and he was a loyal kno@@ b .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point he described the Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the re@@ structure of the purpose of the purpose of the purpose .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult application , however , were the pipe erup@@ tion in church fri@@ ght on a 3rd January .
here we had to work minus 17 degrees the whole night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can also be maintained only because you filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with s@@ lei@@ gh .
the Executive Board of drinking water was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ e@@ de ( circle Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday , on Friday , on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ e@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; the man has inv@@ oked and stated himself to be shot to his partner , &quot; said a police poet .
the perpet@@ rators be on the run , after him become public .
it is now nation@@ wide , since Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , muscular , brown and has a gl@@ itter .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ at@@ y .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could not carry the weapon with him , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , the 110 is supposed to call .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship group . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make data to the T@@ ather@@ land or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being killed .

steel - light output for German steel industry
the cra@@ cked and energy @-@ efficient German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in a million@@ aires .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened with the sector from the oil promotion , are from the table .
it remains at the liberation from the renewable energy revolution to the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister for Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , the &quot; Western German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we were finally able to get negotiations after two years . &quot;
the European commission initially planned to request the steel producer , the gases made up of the blast furnace for producing their own consumption , to request the cas@@ hier .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission after convers@@ ations with the Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG change@@ over@@ s of 20 percent are replaced .
but these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission on its own electricity production .
this means that the status of Status Quo will largely be established .
special meaning has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel , the future &apos; is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; in addition to reform of emission rights , climate and employment targets are considering that IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt , Germany .
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to be more than the world &apos;s largest producer in China due to the weak@@ ening of domestic demand mass@@ aged steel to the world market .
European producers throw Chinese steel companies price d@@ ump@@ ing .
during this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
the import duties of imp@@ lied oil on imp@@ orters took effect , secon@@ dly , the economic prospects in China have raised up .
the price is un@@ clear , as sustainable is the price re@@ covering .
the German industry Pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was careful on Thursday .
last prices would have stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further costs .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to exclu@@ de the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced a total of 3.4 million tonnes of less crude steel than in the previous year as the economic @-@ unification of steel on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the quantity now returned to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year .
in the coming months , the association anticip@@ ates an enhanced order volume with an increasing capacity .
community , Spirit , health : singing , sen@@ iors good
S@@ ingen has accompanied Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p already her entire life : as young girl she was in the school choir , in the teaching position and today she sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior citizen choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes it .
after a sample , she feels more balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
by doing so she does something good with her health and mind .
for singing is equal to several perspectives , a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most Sen@@ iors sang in chor@@ us and share with par@@ ables the joy of music , descri@@ bing H@@ ac@@ kler .
by regular collaboration , sen@@ iors may establish social contacts and maintain .
because they often solve social and familiar structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p in their choir : &quot; extra@@ cting and organize , to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , meaning H@@ ac@@ kler .
the sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
who demands his lungs , even in everyday life not as fast as Pu@@ ste .
even if it comes to get the sound of voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz tells us about the Federal Labour community in the sen@@ iors @-@ organisations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through song lyrics and particularly melodies , people have lost its sick people in long past events .
when singing , a particular performance is required for singing , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time focusing on their own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
just older people who live alone are not just to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition we travel through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing by singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I &apos;m so long for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , he advis@@ es L@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - with 50 sin@@ king people , who can hear when a sound comes to it ?
in search of suitable offer senior citizens have different ways , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
someone will sing someone from the old circle in an old choir , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer views of cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can directly turn to the church or the church leaders .
you can also find many senior cho@@ irs over the Internet .
those who have no access to the Internet can ask friends , friends or neighbors for the Internet .
if you want to sing , it should be joined by a choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul well and has a bit of liber@@ ating - this applies to any age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely as a cat on scre@@ ams of the young animals
biolog@@ ists have examined in Hanover , which effect has the calls of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
to her surprise the Mi@@ che@@ w also did not leave the males cold - however , they always stopped at the difference to the females .
female cats may recognize the arous@@ al of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the th@@ aw@@ ing of the small ones .
they respond to ten percent faster on the k@@ itt@@ ens of kit@@ ten , who felt in great trouble as scientists have found out of veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the th@@ aw@@ ing of less and strongly ero@@ ded young ones for the males either are not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cry with the ur@@ gency of their help needs .
a total of nine adult males and eight males were observed from the MH@@ H of the MH@@ H .
to you were played for a rest of little ones , which were taken from the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for the other , they were confronted with scre@@ ams , which were also lifted up .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the low sample for plant@@ ing .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , responded to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned up faster to the speaker , when this calls of very er@@ ect k@@ itt@@ ens played .

Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time following the screening test there is a major football game again in Turkey .
before the Du@@ eling of the Arch@@ riv@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ce Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line of the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already during the suspension of the emergency test in July , the government was entru@@ sted to the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the exercise of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it will not be taken before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the previous Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
according to this , Sü@@ k@@ r is now being accused of being a member of the terrorist group in America .
Sü@@ k@@ r is alleged to be the follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who will be responsible for the coup attempt at President Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
this is true , initially for 90 days , the state of emergency was pending before October , in fact , in fact , the life of most Turks , however , has no effect on the life of most Turks .
Erdogan &apos;s n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public places throughout the country has said Erdogan on Wednesday .
Sports is like the whole country - split in followers and enemies of Erd@@ og@@ ans .
especially fans of the Club of Bes@@ ic@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the Turks attack the Turks face dramatic experiences in history is strictly ref@@ us@@ al of military coup .
even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether your heart beats to Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ic@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will take place especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
Cologne presented its sporty value in the past season in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of its organisation .
in the final play against Fen@@ tr@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he finished the season in a superb manner and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master took a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
after the round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; will also say early in the Europe League early .
in the south of Li@@ g it was only ranked six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the playing year went better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season buff@@ ers as the South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ protective case , the foundation laid the base for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the 31 year old .
at the same time , the Gom@@ ez was under contract with the Treaty of Florence and will not be announced at Bes@@ ic@@ tas , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ man F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
but if the falls would have to do this , however , if one third of his 7.5 million euros would have to do an estimated annual sal@@ aries , Or@@ man said : &quot; his salary at Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot;
despite di@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities for Olympia in Rio
the 34 year old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice due to d@@ oping in 2001 and 2006 .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led ath@@ letics men can only laugh at that - they &apos;re fighting in Rio for medals .
the topic d@@ oping is still in line with the head@@ lines during the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Jef@@ im@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented himself after a d@@ oping lock ( 100 meters of breast ) after a d@@ oping lock , was excav@@ ated and extended with their start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it was a magnificent scene : with a raised smile , she was still standing in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when she was aware that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke up in a jub@@ il@@ storm .
but there are still numerous athletes competing in the Rio Olympics in spite of the D@@ oping past .
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m Shift / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in ath@@ letics .
he was blocked for d@@ oping for two time ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest finding of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fraser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down a six month lock after taking the pain using ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .

the four broad@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold favour@@ ites .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ s@@ quad@@ ron / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 and have been closed 21 months .

Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes have been recognized so many medals so well .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to also offer Olympic silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ oping and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the also recognized bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the 2008 Olympic Games was given back due to a decision by the International Sports Court of Justice .

bomb enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
she had suffered timber and had been treated in the hospital , but I have left it again .
her hom@@ eb@@ ound voyage will be planned for early September .
one of the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on also have Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are in constant contact with local authorities , so snor@@ ing .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , were initially explo@@ ded two bombs during the Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ ogue were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday early two sp@@ ies went up again , a further man was killed , according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver has been viol@@ ated by a taxi driver at the det@@ onation near the popular bath@@ ers Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , a further bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities in a flower bed , the bomb explo@@ ded in the air before the re@@ vier of the coast police .
eventually det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
one connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called it .
&quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; said army General Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early before journalists .
&quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible mot@@ if@@ s - however , it is likely to take action for the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ bers of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared the attacks not related to the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only the local sab@@ otage that restricted itself on limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
rather , it is believed that the bombs used by enemies of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , authorities have given secrets to im@@ min@@ ent evidence in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact date and places .
still be un@@ clear , which group sho@@ ve behind the hi@@ kes .
the police showed its officials in the whole country , the safety of strengthening major government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand there are smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge themselves against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the ration@@ ality of bombs , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is advis@@ able to provide the instructions of Thai security authorities in a consequence .
high security risk ( level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its en@@ vir@@ ons .
after the disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary journeys to these provinces will not be accessed .
increased safety risk ( level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
this cle@@ ars the military great influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs have been an attempt to st@@ em@@ ulate chaos , while the country moves toward stability , to improve the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ e@@ av@@ al , keeps himself good to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the military for many years in the out@@ ward south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago in Bangkok , there were killed 20 people in Bangkok at a attack on a popular Hindu shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody assault of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
according to several regional offices , the Constitutional disputes have also placed the group under observation in the Federation .
&quot; we see under the &apos; identity &apos; movement &apos; keeping for aspir@@ ations against the freedom of freedom of democratic principles , &quot; said the Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin .
thus , migrants are diff@@ used by Islamic faith or the Middle East in a extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it is opposed to &quot; multi @-@ ult@@ i wre@@ aths , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and &quot; loss of his own identity . &quot;
Constitutional declar@@ es in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; .
Ma@@ ate said his authority in deci@@ ding to be closely coordinated with the offices .
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity &apos; movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
generally , extrem@@ ists try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists as well as legal experts .
that is not an ad@@ ver@@ itable advertising for their own thing .
the propaganda is supposed to address the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are pr@@ one in a special way .
this is dangerous .
most recently , there were reports of several federal states on the contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; of AF@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ did said he has no findings .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case , the AF@@ D - by certain persons , the extrem@@ ist , changes its target direction and is so extrem@@ ist .
thus , whether such people are controlled directly on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view to the considerable increase in ri@@ ght@@ ful off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right @-@ rights terrorism .
but in recent years we have noticed that it can give ri@@ ster@@ ror@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ el@@ er Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee workers or attacks from other right @-@ right motives .
a German @-@ wide or European control of legal ror@@ ism is however not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate did eat that many consider@@ ations went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
that is the wor@@ r@@ ying problem .
many of the susp@@ ect attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic Games or world records of the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold performance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ looked swimming s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer seen in TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently tempted to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ onite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a backing of 48 seconds and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 star .
but it was not his very sporty figure , which attracted the attention of international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in unter@@ re@@ presented countries .
as in Etna , most athletes run , just wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names were ready for the first round .
some media described him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; was fun with him in accordance with a &quot; charity . &quot;
his time , he first struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Fre@@ estyle and did not play any role .
the compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games of 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ mund@@ i took care of medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from the Ä@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in an over@@ flow over 100 m Fre@@ estyle alone .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at the back then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim for eight months before the Olympia , and never had a long distance before the competition .

it should not be anything with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .

Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it would either be fl@@ aps , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television sen@@ ders CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him in the end of political correc@@ t@@ ness , it is fine , said Tr@@ ump .

in his party , more and more resistance was form@@ ulated .

accidents - bus @-@ slip in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
in an accident of a travel agent with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers on Thursday , eight people have been injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ l@@ n ( District Apostle Aur@@ me ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injury , shared the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to devi@@ ate according to an opposite slide , which drove partly on the road .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a speaker of the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus the people couldn &apos;t leave the bus self @-@ constantly , &quot; she said .
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six life@@ jack@@ ets and a ambul@@ ance were returned to the accident of the state road 2 .
the un@@ last travelers were taken back by a bus service to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ör@@ ner District Pe@@ w@@ sum .

the fees per cubic metre of waste water is starting from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World Positions 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ e@@ water fee will be increased by then , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
after the per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf is then 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the budget was determined through the household and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , so that wast@@ e@@ water systems have under@@ gone under@@ cover@@ ings .
due to the legal basis of the market , the market is oblig@@ ated to operate facilities .
starting from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and industrial enterprises from the world trav@@ eller , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg have to interven@@ e deep into the w@@ allet .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Herbert Schmidt to the Panel , a new calculation of the fees for the wast@@ e@@ water treatment was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or sub@@ covering from the previous period of the period will be compens@@ ated .
because of all three se@@ wage plants , Schmidt established that it is relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage plant which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs would end up several thousand Euros .
furthermore , the se@@ wage rise in all three systems is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ lining period of all three plants were not least due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair charges in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for the gave birth , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt demonstrated that in the wast@@ e@@ water system Az@@ endorf had to replace the mechanical ventilation system due to damage .
in the pump@@ ing work , which had to over@@ take over 20 years of old conveyor systems , which had to be out@@ dated after nearly 20 years of operation of the first sep@@ tic pond , the sep@@ tic tank has to be dispos@@ ed of , and an additional ventilation can also be installed in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res , the ongoing service and maintenance costs were considered to be considered in the new scope of calculations . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were still evident at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that in the three plant wast@@ e@@ water wast@@ es had to be fully crossed for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
according to this , Schmidt , added the market for major maintenance costs in the wast@@ e@@ water plants last 20 years , has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to stay focused on time , especially when it is not possible to extend the supply area of the se@@ wage system Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al for these facilities , because it is about deficit facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as Asian cartoon critic@@ ises
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its filter tool , the Snap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already known to the absur@@ dity .
you can transform yourself into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are intact , unique design tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ections per day .
complete patches will arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have put criticism in the past , in which they were accused that the App Black@@ face promoting or white skin would prop@@ agate as beauty ideal .
when this week some U@@ ps proposed a filter , which gave them sli@@ t , wrong teeth and int@@ ru@@ ed che@@ eks , some critics identified a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; j@@ aun@@ ted out . &quot;
they question@@ ed whether this repeated check@@ ered has occurred on a larger problem that the company has diversity .
the messages and the Out@@ rage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat told that it would have had the feature down@@ lighted .
the company had an exc@@ use : the filter was intended to pay homage to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism , re@@ minded the filter to inf@@ ring@@ ing cl@@ lich@@ és .
other refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean American student , whose twe@@ et was widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; viol@@ ently and were told un@@ comfortable . &quot;
it added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ part of a very conflic@@ ting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not safe , but that the yel@@ lowing has been drawn to ab@@ or@@ tive extre@@ mes .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ al and integration battle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand .
and snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - those who are di@@ vers@@ ed in race as their older opponents - might be expected to assume sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium , decided to delete your Snap@@ chat account and others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview they said that there was a lack of diversity of diversity in the import practices at the Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the great part of white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say anything about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company has no figures for the diversity of its employees and points to its status as private companies .
on Thursday we refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a personnel responsible , focusing on population groups and on internal integration .
Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users to tell us that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military transfer for@@ ges ISIS secret services , introduces Committee of Congress
military deployment of the United States Central Command changed payment information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , as it would allow the actual states on @-@ site to report an investigation committee on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of rep@@ ubli@@ can members , secret service providers and military bud@@ get@@ te , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Con@@ ysts , reported how att@@ itudes towards American efforts changed against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news service information , which were typically embroi@@ dered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander as it would have been authorized to have the actual states on @-@ site , and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s leadership errors are to be held to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed clinical problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct evidence to change the government pointed out of Obama &apos;s instructions , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their su@@ peri@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , opinions and statements were clearly more positive than it corresponds to facts &quot; presented the report . &quot;
as an example , Cent@@ Com affiliated to Cent@@ Com was publicly announced that a military deployment of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , is so much clear . &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o said , rep@@ ubli@@ can congress from Kansas , in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 up to the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the night security reports to record the danger through ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force after them , that analysts were concerned about the manip@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Government of the Defense Department .
the Democratic Members of the News Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of rep@@ ubli@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essi@@ vely limited process for the creation of guidelines on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; commissioned Adam B. Schiff , a member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed publication of subsequent intelligence , &quot; dismissed the moral under analysts and &quot; was excessive enough space for differ@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ cr@@ ats were given no evidence of having found evidence of an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts as regards a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations have been published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported about investig@@ ating the Pentagon promoted to complaints from Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , was published in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not have reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the general inspection course was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have passed through the question of a successful air campaign through US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have rejected the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
criticism concerning the imp@@ ed@@ ance of the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago when Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , looked at the recommendations of many analysts in Iraq and had little time to negoti@@ ate on the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to establish government points that would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this provisional refin@@ eries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com@@ s dam@@ aging commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the legisl@@ ature because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and has been replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at Central Command .
the United States win four @-@ year match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with the UK .
one day after she had shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans can win with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
but this is what they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic contest and are the same in their group with the British on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place is going to pass a little longer a little longer from the path that lead the other group .
as always the game is coming out on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising le@@ ver through their success story , four years after they ended up in the past London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel university ) , with 16 years she became the national team of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; one change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work time in London we have now .
we can completely hit the rod completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen on the first half of the game with a back hand blow from the near range .
India was gone without victory in the game , but the team showed himself surprisingly tough and held the pitch of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved the ball in the center to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all tournament for the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
exactly like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on Saturday &apos;s outcome .
amid the Olympics of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and inevitable , a fast relay of competition and pursu@@ it .
it is as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is fed by the Cross@@ bow to the Turner to the Tri@@ ath@@ leten .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queu@@ e in the Coff@@ es@@ hop , without having Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ap , or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman of women with dimples , would have been among those known names that would have been sent to Prime Time , being built by sponsors and feel @-@ TV advertising if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ us@@ ey .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event right away .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports which are not univers@@ ally recognized : air@@ no@@ zzles , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the ni@@ pp@@ le swimming and may rule it long .
but if I should really make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me direct attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tr@@ amp has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was perceived so many that I had asked , did not know that there is a Olympic champion for ever .
that could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent athletes on the Contests , it has never had a medal on a trampoline , and had had a ath@@ lete up until 2012 , who made it until the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese , and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year .
the jumping on the trampoline has some outdoor page char@@ me , partly because it sounds more appropriate for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a her@@ d@@ ding enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never to end clouds - but also the Gra@@ zie of gy@@ ms and do@@ cking , the two sports which essentially unite .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board &quot; .
jump off on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , cou@@ gh and sage ) before they land on their feet .
they will be assessed according to the official Olympics on execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
six @-@ year athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight forward .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to continue in their pursu@@ it of gold , faster , upwards and steep@@ ly , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and back , up and down at the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall , but in the television broadcast also another polite destination : the world or the Olympic Tower .
the targeted stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even add a viewer to tears .
but it is also what I think even when looking this games as something exhau@@ sting .
the trampoline offers a breath @-@ break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a moving movement is not the target .
he or she jump from , seem@@ ingly wei@@ ght@@ less as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then back to the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no c@@ abri@@ an into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant up@@ lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympic Games .
the qualifying and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time , the men on Saturday also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a follow @-@ up block at both days and 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase of consciousness can be reached only by the Ang@@ ular and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to the The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his after air , a new fan base .
a generation protest@@ ing &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is a ally of ally
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , seeking political changes in Ethiopia , viol@@ ate violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig @-@ workers were killed during c@@ lashes with the police at Sch@@ uss@@ ers .
is Ethiopia my right to collapse ?
in the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid association with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ attered the land and spread in more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med to streets and asked fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government was un@@ merciful .
witnesses were told that polic@@ emen were shot and killed in@@ armed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , there are videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security officers were young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now asking a thorough research .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in future it will even become more difficult , &quot; says Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is cher@@ ished from the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in considerable speed .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ulum in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continuously have led the op@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , with dis@@ si@@ dents become effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed , or put into the vast expan@@ ses of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except protest@@ ing , it breaks out , &quot; told Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ies .
the entire Youth is protest@@ ing .
a generation protest@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to dig@@ ging in regards to power of ruling coalition .
after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions down the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this h@@ ack@@ y , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts were like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , protecting the turbul@@ ence in recent years and could re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of the deteri@@ oration after years of age @-@ an@@ kles will explo@@ de on the surface .
the first seems to harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media since cheap smartphones were becoming increasingly common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government fre@@ aks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , above all in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians showed , that they were gathered to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethanol in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
there have been a prosp@@ ering of the Am@@ har@@ as , which mainly come from e@@ op@@ ia , in politics and economy , while they explo@@ ited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and live in flat regions .
but even this changes straight .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia domin@@ ates un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which comprise around 6 per cent of the population , and the military , dominant in the intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ public disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as a visual gen@@ ius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts predi@@ ct that he was especially referred to to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and use special officials to process opponents and to make them harmful .
&quot; the present regime is lack of this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts agree that he enjoys not the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time , Ethiopia was such an u@@ pro@@ ar , since the thousands of elections were protest@@ ing , according to the data of analy@@ tics apparently f@@ aked and stolen by the government .
during the following Raz@@ ants , many Protest@@ ants were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised the Ethiop@@ ian leaders , as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its measur@@ able progress in poverty ab@@ at@@ ement .
but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , Protest@@ ants held in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , dominated by Tig@@ ray and the hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analysts agree that the protests of the US and other Western allies bring to a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used the American government as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ou@@ ghs to neighbouring Somalia , even if it recently agreed that it closed the base .
while the West wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in a vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin congratulations . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declar@@ es his asser@@ tion Obama was founded ISIS &apos; Sar@@ cas@@ us . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter@@ y the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his campaign was to sc@@ rut@@ in@@ ize his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously .
this clari@@ fication raises new questions about the communication skills of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans whether it is capable of communic@@ ating and comprehen@@ sible to communicate with the American public .
it also brings his fel@@ low@@ out , who make every effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain the pec@@ uli@@ ar position , which he could not have meant .
after he had made the indication of a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump put back on the asser@@ tion on Thursday and in@@ sist@@ ed on interviews that he really didn &apos;t intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in a morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , in which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the testimony that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , wanted to know nothing about the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate .
the final storm of criticism against Mr. Tr@@ ump desc@@ ends while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign for accident surveys on economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again to this issue .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons of suggestions would lead to higher taxes and found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ cas@@ us to his defence .
at the end of July , he moved strong criticism from himself when he said that Russians should hold Mrs. Clin@@ tons of emails , but he later said &quot; Natural , &quot; I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to rowing .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans , as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates .
but I think he is smart enough to keep his testim@@ onies enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of sharp@@ est the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed a cor@@ rosive sound , because his det@@ ections are gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a large margin in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is trying not to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative declar@@ ations , he accused his critics to dist@@ ort his say@@ ings or fal@@ sely .
but while he is foc@@ ussed on attention in the past few months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps joke his loyal participation in the un@@ comfortable situation to have to stand independently of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may be his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ acy , there were big effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he was question@@ ed by Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Clinton would have founded the Islamic State .
it is true in that sense that before Obama had an almost unknown , small organization , he called her am@@ ni@@ sts , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most of the ma@@ instream Republi@@ can try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton had served as an out@@ sider , ISIS has allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them back on any of his words and pre@@ judi@@ ced against him .
he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; TV expert who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot;
some of the demo@@ cr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ umps exc@@ use only another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .
once pushed over the price of the market , cafe in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a ashamed café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years good coffee served .
of course , the prices were displac@@ ed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front .
So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s shop , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals smo@@ kes it as last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is a change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is a change , it is also curiosity .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new site , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu includes sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and saut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural phenomena .
the café serves no beer more , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ oked power on old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by prices of William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way forward .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave her a coffee break for a while , she said .
&quot; I realized that it was at the coffee and on the culture in the ver@@ b which I liked , &quot; she said .
now they drink coffee again , even if they were in this day instead of their usual iced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and receive new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets its usual order but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not think about it , that the soap store took the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has offered a special soap for use with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has compiled the menu in Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has prepared to exhibit her soon so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee in the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands on an adjacent building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed in the ground , when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the site of Lok@@ as and the Order felt a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension into the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took up his lunch at O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets President Roosevelt was a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ ac@@ ies at Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mar@@ yland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering from suffering , &quot; Jane Z@@ sealed .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery histor@@ ians .
co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while brick in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; talks about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a rep@@ orter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ y I@@ mb@@ ach in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh water sc@@ rub@@ bing with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Turkey ate with m@@ ashed and vegetable mixture .
when the rep@@ orter responded , this took the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Z@@ sealed .
there were pean@@ uts , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a few cheap ones , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many pean@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ ves for male field workers and it was served fresh baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans sent to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; is drawing up the way with which the country went with it not to be more lar@@ gen@@ land .
&quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central theme , &quot; touched Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
the new budget was ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bread and cas@@ ser@@ ole were added to basic food , the cas@@ ser@@ ole , as a magnificent way to re@@ juven@@ ate the cas@@ ser@@ ene , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients among a cre@@ st sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheap dry fruit .
meat , which was years of focus of American cuisine , became a rarely serv@@ iced luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar compounds have been tried , as a cal@@ orie and nutr@@ itious satisfaction had priority before taste or even healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , bricks made a court of this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was not a popular additi@@ ve at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
brick continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
like never before or since then , the fiscal budget - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating habits of the country ab@@ rup@@ tly .
by being published in newspapers and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; budget sp@@ ol@@ iti@@ ves &quot; and the challenge to transform Pamp@@ a as cre@@ m@@ ly sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical treat .
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake .
as he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ ei@@ ves like the one @-@ million@@ th man of the world to which he became .
&quot; he liked Continental Cu@@ isine than fish with belt con@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ king .
he was terri@@ fic to reality .
President Roosevelt would have sinned the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example of his stomach .
as described in the book , the invention of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours caused by Mrs Roosevelt , that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most famous prepared . &quot;
many of the types from the Great Depression , to deal with food , has been rejected when the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple had to better understand the eating habits of Z@@ bri@@ m &apos;s mother in law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
when you remember , people actually got sick . &quot;
there was the result of the wind .
after the plates had been cleared out at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they removed and Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dra@@ ined to lunch the President Roosevelt .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zu@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a modest name .
there was no whi@@ pped cream , but pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped something un@@ will@@ ingly a spoon into the c@@ low@@ ly , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly it was not bad .
Co@@ e repeated three times a night .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ be@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar , his life was dedicated to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died when the Assad regime has died .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that saved the life according to the image newspaper so far more than 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make their first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian cover , which shows him on a 11 hour rescue from a ring from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians for a shining symbolic figure in the th@@ aw@@ ing of war .
as a hero , he has never seen himself , saying , &quot; For me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; if I die to save lives , I think God can see a mart@@ yr . &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter have cast four corners on the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respir@@ ation .
&quot; we now eliminate the remains of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; the image c@@ ites his last words before he died .
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terror@@ ists .
Grön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ ra is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie received only with 150 years of offspring .
on average , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms on the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is average just 1,@@ 220 meters far .
only when it matters , it acceler@@ ates the five @-@ metre long animal to sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a stur@@ geon .
this healthy lifestyle seems to be a patch concept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; anyway from a Grön@@ land@@ hai which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ um@@ lein is commented by Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
however , the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist thought long that Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie is stone old .
only the evidence was lacking .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they usually live on the surface only in winter .
researchers know a little about the lifestyle of Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie &apos;s lifestyle .
her zeit@@ pent@@ ine expressed it , when they spread six animals with a transmitter in front of the S@@ val@@ bard .
however , these shar@@ ks nevertheless found themselves : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a stur@@ geon , another had swallowed the jaw bones of a young king@@ fis@@ her .
perhaps they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice@@ berg and seek cad@@ aver , which tor@@ tured from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as cat@@ cher from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long , while the largest 502 @-@ cen@@ tim@@ eters measured .
to determine the age of animals , it analy@@ zes the carbon @-@ 14 method of shar@@ pen@@ ing shar@@ ks .
this centre lens arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which are not renewed in the proteins .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had taken a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
after the early 1960s , their birth should therefore lie in the atmosphere larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters , the linear nucle@@ us contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012 .
all the bigger Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie in its len@@ tic@@ les had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which arises due to cosmic ray in the atmosphere .
in fact , carbon @-@ 14 @-@ Clock was shown for a 4@@ 93 cm long Grön@@ land@@ hai one of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k should be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they &apos;re longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to re@@ arrange the length of their length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters probably became the threshold for the sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication of at least one and a half centuries period .
this also might be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ ur@@ eme live primarily in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , whose burning was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was captured before Alaska .
the low temperatures often run the organism to the animals living there .
so they mature - and al@@ tern slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal heat remains .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives thus more dangerous and should focus on how many offspring as soon as possible , &quot; explains the theory of evolution .
in contrast , a very big animal should rather invest its resources in long life .
construction site in double pack
the municipal council in the most recent meeting deals primarily with topics concerning this building .
with relief , the Panel took up the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , &quot; the marketing of the younger residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the boundary , par@@ cel@@ eration and al@@ location issues were clari@@ fied and the mot@@ ions could be made on measuring , the sale of the plots in the residential areas of road &quot; roads &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area section 1 ) on interested parties can do nothing more in the way .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
accordingly , the City of Main Event has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies in London with Paris , Dublin and Luxemburg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Market F@@ airs and Real Estate markets of I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain if money stores are further operated from financial transactions across the EU .
approval in the UK is thus far enough for the so @-@ called EU passport .
these are just great U.S. banks .
several banks have already announced to re@@ locate jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying Association in Frankfurt am Main Finance &quot; expects a 10000 new jobs at the Main Event in five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is the responsibility for monetary policy and super@@ vis@@ ing over the largest banks of the Eurozone , including further important authorities , such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and risk of risk ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) had its headquarters , but this was less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as it can communicate so directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
at the same time , Luxembourg gets a major fund for money , as well as Dublin as well as in the infrastructure near the infrastructure .
due to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
further points of the city with slightly available commercial real estate ads .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder is saying .
in addition to the Seine , the rent for high @-@ class business premises are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consulting Mer@@ cer , the city was set up on No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg to No.@@ 19 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W ref@@ uses .
however , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote in Europe .
it is also about 14@@ 4,000 people working in London according to the numbers of Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs of the hep@@ atitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. office decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs which you created from the hep@@ atitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge issued a pattern of mis@@ behaviour on the part of Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ eth@@ ic deeds .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US bure@@ tor Bethel Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the cost , created during the defence of the F@@ all .
Mer@@ ck tries to agree with Gilead that ruled the market of a new generation of hep@@ atitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took up each other def@@ endants and its property to laboratory work , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir is fundamental , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
from the United States to say that they have returned full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from Islamic State

the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are after the cer@@ pt of the remaining group of fighters who have dig@@ ged themselves within the city , currently the city .
they released over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stage by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council with Reuters .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband &apos;s income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ our@@ aren ; the former Foreign Minister made an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their ministry in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax returns to the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement .
in a cold contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false exc@@ uses and tra@@ des in terms of his promises to publish its tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York Business man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for ref@@ using a tax test by the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s electoral campaign Ian SA@@ MS on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate in the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump , advis@@ es special advis@@ ors to CNN that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the controls are not finished .
Tr@@ umps critics , among others also the rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already picked up his ref@@ us@@ al questions regarding their wealth , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already kicked out on the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which Rep@@ ublic@@ ans Rep@@ ublic@@ ans publishing its tax returns .
on Thursday the subject spoke also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other candidate has done in the past few decades and publish its tax returns . &quot; she said to the crowd .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump paid for two years or only very little taxes , and an econom@@ ist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax administration and tax advis@@ ors that might still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign .
Clinton supports a provision that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that people pay more than USD 1 million and pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha Clinton last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ kshire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat to exchange their tax returns .
Buff@@ ett said that he was subjected to a tax test from the IRS and Tr@@ ump &quot; are afraid of voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ tons Camp@@ a@@ ign has published fiscal withdrawal until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , is on average an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 revealed that these only USD 100 of their income earned as a wage , different from the majority of all Americans .
its main investment location was a cost @-@ cost index fund , made by Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9,000 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many speakers have previously used to defend itself .
Friday is World @-@ phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude , with much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants of their fields , without the elephant tracking , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a communication .
the first two steps include the lighting of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bubbles in a horn .
if it is not turned off , a so called &quot; Ch@@ ili@@ clou@@ ke &quot; will be thrown out .
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ce pu@@ ree with earth is packed together with a fire body in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition switch is turned .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom is bur@@ sting with a buck@@ le and spra@@ ys fine dust at ch@@ ili powder into the air .
a touch of right is usually taken out to chase the eleph@@ ants .
the last opportunity is a throwing , who sho@@ ots a golf mo@@ ist into the air , causing a loud , light explosion .

Jewish director breaks Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; re@@ sign@@ ation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots , unle@@ ashed a media record , after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have any Israeli pre@@ fix , since there had been an Arab score for an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann invited Israel to find on the country &apos;s selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol has a way to choose Israel about an own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer that he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; like Lanz@@ mann .
the hotel stated that the measure has a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director even more angry .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they asked that the pre @-@ election will be deleted , &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and over@@ thrown by this event .
that is really very gri@@ ev@@ ous .
the fact that this has borne in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires that .
we expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister .
the incident triggered a rather large resonance in the internet , in which the people called a sc@@ andal .
some dis@@ counted the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged aff@@ inity of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly referred all of the accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; betra@@ yal &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; for Lanz@@ mann , &quot; Der Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel is not in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung had a speaker in the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .
police uses Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Bun@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ant Brazilian students
students started to join the police on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo when they were gathered to protest against the reforms of the government for the public educational system .
the police replaced Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Rub@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against the protest@@ ers .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to explore the students , which led to the police , rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the European Parliament &apos;s proposals in Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300.000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the participants were looking to spray Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the preliminary presi@@ dents of Michel T@@ emer on walls .
a few days after demonstr@@ ators in masses went to the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ sion@@ ed President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been reli@@ eved from the office through a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the abol@@ ition of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran were equal to 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent in the year comparison .
since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , interest in pages of Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country .
Russian companies accept existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade exchange between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 grew by 7@@ 0.9 % compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trading post was achieved by supplies of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign territory had around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with tourist numbers in Russia .
it could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador is hoping that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims for mercy
the ministers from the sailors from the seaf@@ ar@@ ship Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
together , four stages were finished .
in order to bridge over time to the next Roman@@ tic journey of all ministers in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ rant round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various shr@@ ine objectives have been reviewed and they finally decided on the Epis@@ cop@@ al town of Freiburg , where in this year the mercy @-@ opened gate of Mer@@ cy at the Frei@@ burger Münster was offered a special pilgrimage destination .
16 Min@@ is made of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ rooms are on the way .
in the evening , Pastor Stor@@ k sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and divided the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where a Münster &apos;s beloved wife is standing and so the pilgrimage has been kicked out of Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but on the way , the Min@@ is made on field cross , chap@@ els or churches all again and again to sing a song from the pilgrims song .
for the nights there were par@@ ishes of local parish available .
at the stage matches Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty and supp@@ ress@@ ful dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ ave to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .

the award @-@ served reward was a common s@@ gr@@ illing on the bath in the evening .
after the dawn on fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it was on the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met on the Frei@@ burger Münster in the late afternoon and steps over the doors of Mer@@ cy .
with a small impulse , God was than@@ king here .
Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ ner Markus O@@ bert at the evening fair in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the Sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ metropolis .

at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were affected .
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner moves home when Br@@ ite won gold for cycling
from the last night &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s Sk@@ inner race in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , the British team def@@ ending the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made the legend proud as he came home to visit a victory of New Zealand &apos;s favour@@ ites .
four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the Train World Championships in London , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys re@@ produced a gap that tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed when they saw potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots that now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y won a Olympic champion , but in the qualifying rounds a Olympic champion , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ unden won the New Ze@@ al@@ anders in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
round barely back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategic shift made a major part of the transformation , with the execution in a higher gear used to slow it down and allow to allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up a Olympic champion in the final stages and conquered the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 , Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys were on the side that he inten@@ tionally fell on the train after a weak start .
he later with@@ drew this testimony later and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ val .
there was no such a problem with such an overwhelming victory .
he said , &quot; It feels all the GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we came so badly at so many world titles that it was incredible , to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the be@@ ware of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lonely alone to win alone .
he said , &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be beaten to kn@@ ights . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts in the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ke W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the World Record , who won gold in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first round and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at the W@@ ig@@ gins , focusing on security .
yesterday , he fought against the qualification in front of the qualification , they called him to measure his body size .
commenting on the women &apos;s competition , which continued tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Arch@@ i@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving at his strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a shot at medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dom@@ ination in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio was shut down .
drums played in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April is set in the midst of sex mus@@ sels and bul@@ lying animals as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton .
however , if one sees itself the first evening of the competition at Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary calling for GB@@ s , which finally reaches its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland caused by raising the energy contract
the future of the aluminum mel@@ ts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game since the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , and that all supply agreements will be lifted up , such as the supply of energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a grant was established for 20 years in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland are based on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing .
in addition , it may come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melt of approximately 10 per cent of the whole generation of electricity consum@@ es .
in 2014 AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , leading the last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the facility , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the facility .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium drop with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that three additional owners will be announced their contracts .
the facility is in the majority owned by a joint venture between AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the system continues to operate in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L continues to say that the Tre@@ aties should have &quot; backup transactions , &quot; which should be in force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L goes out that the contracts in the business year 17 can contribute to the revenues , &quot; said the supply supplier .
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenue from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong dates for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L told that it had already written the value of the tre@@ aties in its annual sum amounting to $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting of power , or power supply to ensure melt &quot; do not imp@@ acted .
the US company said that in 2010 , it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force in 2010 , even if it is still a statement , why it has been signed by the contract .
analysts war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland had some 600 MW and Tom@@ ago some 900 mega@@ watts of electricity every year .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as a generator that would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , B@@ ander@@ a is on the cover of the September issue of the V@@ ogue
B@@ ander@@ th@@ ian Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ner and Mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the special edition of the US V@@ ogue .
the brand ambassador for E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and running on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ agram account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; B@@ ander@@ a wrote .
the unveil@@ ing of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ lov@@ hi@@ an @-@ similar family ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family , as she forgot the cover of her sister and that ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise @-@ party .
this presents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ coated plot almost every birthday episode ( Se@@ ac@@ qui@@ d told the set , &quot; You thought that we should forget you ? , &quot; with hon@@ esty of a animation on a radio station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kris had to participate in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the release of the V@@ ogue with safety a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim likes them to have hit the V@@ ogue cover , defeated ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue is a league for himself .
the September edition is the most complete edition of the year for V@@ ogue .
with a compass , rather resembles a book book as a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of advertising operators ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the ball 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is eag@@ erly a@@ waited that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine can se@@ ep in before the official announcement .
women who have already been on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities , the model &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; Transpar@@ ent model &quot; of her generation , is in good company .
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or young people from today who know how to get a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything on Jen@@ ner applies ) .
they are really talented women who can draw in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success .
with her reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers had always looked forward in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings will be back up again when the news came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but riding on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass at the point .
Kendall Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures from themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal council measures annually 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary needs are rejected annually by the municipal council centres , while the industry has led to the impact on further cuts on over@@ load transactions .
in Queens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , vulner@@ able workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair del@@ og@@ ations and similar - have been rejected on free legal advice and legal advice .
legal services of the community , which are already covered in moder@@ ately , are ready for further reductions .
as of June , next year , the legal centres will lose further 30 per cent of their federal agents .
the Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell , said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Council was revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without repe@@ ating the decision of the federal government would only get worse .
&quot; Queens@@ land Common areas are chron@@ ically supported , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debts , families who were dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who show un@@ just problems - all these people have problems of legal way , and this survey showed that they will not get the help you need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will be cutting by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpful people from Queens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we demand the General Prosecutor and the federal authority as well as the sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise this middle cuts , so that people may need help you need in legal problems .
last year the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal help on the national average .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of European elections : SPD and CDU
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , substantial losses for the gover@@ ning party SPD and CDU are characterised .
this showed representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rain in the north , this is not possible after question@@ ing in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would thus have good chances to continue the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.6 percent in five years ago to 24 percent .
according to pol@@ l , the party was still slightly ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the AF@@ D .
up to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would be represented at 19 percent in the country &apos;s day .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens was re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 per cent ) once again into the heav@@ y@@ day land day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent on land day .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD approved the survey only to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 percent ) .
the CDU only reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
they are still standing behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but above the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 per cent ) .
AF@@ D would be represented at the Congress of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP might hope to return to the pirates in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Time : 20 years ago the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator entered the market .
the successor is domin@@ ating the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the weighed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky .
at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would today suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ ections with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; took place exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet , but they come somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the internet @-@ age .
however , 20 years ago , Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hannover as &quot; office in the western model . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time standard : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , even if tor@@ mented slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there is a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was pretty proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro .
no one could see that Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era in August 1996 .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the mobile division of the Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , was eventually sold and handled at Microsoft .
today vend@@ ors control the market , which all came much later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , 5@@ 55 million units alone .
global sales of the devices is around 400 billion euros .
this enables the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommun@@ ications company .
around the smartphone has now been developed a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came first in early 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World &apos;s introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three equipment in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , easy to use via touch screen .
the Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the corporation .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the offspring .
she finally van@@ ished , Black@@ berry has to fight .
now the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ understanding for 20 years after his invention .
on average every German now shows 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; we have to learn all the smartphone even too , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , in the Siemens executive board for personnel .
permanent sub@@ missions are now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must shift the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only used in our local communities and in all London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as it was in 2012 in London when we used a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions prof@@ ited from games .
the Olympics brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and these will achieve again by creating new possibilities for loc@@ ating and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local congregations , we will already make 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , creating 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ rows is too large .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will run on the world stage .
the branches had no wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row does not answer any question there .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to create wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and all the UK .
we have completed a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented tread@@ mills in the world .
now they are ready to provide a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London games were a great success for UK 2012 and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we control this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs , which can be proud of the UK .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ play &quot; regarding ad blocking
according to one of the software production trials , advertising block@@ ages are getting around , an &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ spiel . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that Ad@@ block Plus would block a blo@@ g@@ post in which it hur@@ ried that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook told us that its des@@ kt@@ ops would change the coding regarding his advertis@@ ements to identify them , which is part of the advertising page , to make it difficult to recognize .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight between the line @-@ temp@@ ting open source community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will come back with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s biggest company for social media has left in the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ r@@ ying b@@ ill@@ ess has become the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people are used worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 3 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , hand advertising makes 84 per cent of the recorded fac@@ ebooks .
the company has set it on ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large percentage of income , so Facebook appears to be worth men@@ tion@@ ing such a stri@@ de .
on Tuesday , Facebook told that it would update his &quot; ad balance pool &quot; to control people more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that it would have wor@@ r@@ ying new filters because they would also block content on the site , which are no public@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ my agent , which is why we have focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman trying to transfer suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police calls for witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a susp@@ ect suicide by several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman slept in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police concluded in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , which was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police , which , as well as any witnesses of the incident , said to be reported .
an investig@@ ational procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a conflict avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the Prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be held responsible .
in each of the two cases - where a person was running in the dark on the free@@ way - was decided that drivers will not assume that a pede@@ stri@@ l runs at the night on the motorway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ ligent killing was acquitted when she had killed a man and killed one night in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has grown un@@ conscious on the road , took the court .
the court asked that the polic@@ eman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfectly extraordinary and un@@ predict@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate Impact dell : Venus was hab@@ itable once
according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate change , Venus was probably hab@@ itable once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that re@@ semble by clim@@ atic research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have deposited on similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously mentioned that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ gy atmosphere , yet slowly turned on .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to lodge living and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; at the G@@ ISS Model simulation the slow revolution of Venus exposed their daily page of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a umbrella , to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a history of the Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planetary research .
although it was probably resi@@ li@@ gible , Venus -- during the course of more than billions years , were subjected to heat and ultra@@ violet light .
your oceans dar@@ ed and its water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen dropped out only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus we know as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate change in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a close co @-@ determination of the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , General Manager / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy had in a statement .
I have long been thinking about how I could improve this team as much as I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needed and to bring it to higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly gear@@ ed towards the organization .
he must also have a co @-@ determination of decisions that influence the power of the team .
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of League award as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota , and missed the late season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
when Hall of Fame Tor@@ ah , Roy four Stanley C@@ ups won two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ labor@@ ers again take discussions on , put strike
the labour strug@@ gles for the re@@ mun@@ eration for North overseas workers will be suspended , while all parties sit down for a new round table debates , they said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ united the dis@@ integration of the present route , &quot; says it in a joint statement .
we will stop some full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , beginning next year to re@@ boot the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage mat@@ ures of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group has shortened the rati@@ os to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company needs the required space to come across the market .
shell has released for its part of thousands of people and plans to surrender his oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of his business operations as a result of his meg@@ ac@@ tional rise with the BG Group .
as a result of low crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that decided to leave the European Union by decision of the British in June .
the Scottish parliamentary committee , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest working conflict that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rates of stars in star@@ lings of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Wel@@ y teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star@@ ry uprising .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars are rotating at different rati@@ os as well as in which context the rot@@ ational spaces are set up with the planet .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ isons of our results with other star@@ ches , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his old age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cor@@ rid@@ dle of the ple@@ j@@ ade is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this star@@ ry originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these att@@ acking stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the stars of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is al@@ lied , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each death by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a visible star spots -- as sun@@ spots -- recognis@@ es .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that massive stars move slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slow down pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow Rot@@ ors tend to be more aggressive , while they tend to be very bright red , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star@@ lings of Ple@@ y@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the spell of the ple@@ j@@ ade offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and elderly , &quot; Reb@@ ull had said .
it is much ahead of what we like to learn more about how , When and why stars slow@@ ed down their rot@@ ations , and so as to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of rotation rates in the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star k@@ icks off
with Alex Rodri@@ guez , the tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will carry out the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature among a ten @-@ year contract has been generating a 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contra@@ diction on 31 December 2017 he will serve as consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , he paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 he made the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ est@@ ones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members , H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics .
nevertheless the 41 @-@ year @-@ old has not yet to be recorded in the assembly hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so cont@@ ested , its occurrence is outside the place .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was charged with &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; which had forbidden death rates between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , it was closed to 211 games due to its involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main susp@@ ect for years to have received extensive funding for years via an anti @-@ aging hospital in southern Florida .
after a law@@ suit the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor in 2014 , because I played a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said very cute .
his deportation days also did not run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games get even the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win every game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .

Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping cases .
one a@@ woke Ath@@ let@@ in would have won almost a medal .
the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro has become known before the seventh competition day of competition .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ ber Adrian Ob@@ inski were well tested and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the beginning of the ath@@ letics competitions this news occur .
Chen was already proven by the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ cul@@ ating agent for d@@ oping substances .
the International Sports Court of CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupies the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , only about 0.0@@ 9 seconds they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Chen would have to participate in the prec@@ ursor on 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Chen has requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands Chen collaboration with the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will collabor@@ ate with the International Sport Court CAS and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history , IO@@ C is not responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
likewise in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
it is innocent , &quot; the only declaration could be dietary supplements , &quot; said the Ath@@ let@@ in .
according to the report it is said to act in the forbidden substance for blood dop@@ amine EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B trial should also be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w promptly announced with criticism of the Ath@@ let@@ in .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight li@@ fter from the chron@@ ically loaded nation cannot participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case of &quot; Adrian Target &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had been tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both of them deny the intake , but both can not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is especially a heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the German association IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team until one exception due to systematic d@@ oping for systematic d@@ oping in Kenya , and the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sports , former clubs in China had also taken care of violent disputes between athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I will say , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio .
sun was also in the centre of a conflict with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping bet@@ gers , &quot; said this .
sun was tested positively at the Chinese nationals in 2014 , but only had to sit down a tri@@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ ge lock .
dat@@ alog@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware currently attack targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey carried out by the malware @-@ defense specialist Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies were at least once , in part some several victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were even target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 per cent of the victims , will@@ ingly , will@@ ingly paid by the perpet@@ rators to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes and attacks on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful , the potentially explosive ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin Kle@@ czy@@ n@@ ski explained in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rator discovered software for itself .
only Privat@@ e@@ ers were the goal , but the change to company attacks was sc@@ ary rapidly throughout the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an victim , it searches specifically for in@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files en@@ codes the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software will then be presented to the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the de@@ cryp@@ t code to the files , the victims must pay money - usually in the form of d@@ yp@@ t Bit@@ coin .
but where for private users the personal photo database is on the game , there is a sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off if a ran@@ som@@ ware is able .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business activity , in case of a case people were in danger .
several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks , whose patients could be threatened by loss of sick@@ ac@@ ut .
&quot; we say to the victims , don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; says Kle@@ czy@@ n@@ ski .
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators due to a halt in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers from F @-@ Secure have examined the user surface and contact the results : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you declare their sacrifices by chat how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , address freely accessible support websites or de@@ code for free download files .
and will be saved by private people after payments of a few hundred Euro , companies need to be hard negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski from the Antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
but more likely , it is about three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their malware software in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by buying the malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then find further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a crime and sends another way to install the software on as many PCs .
payment is made per in@@ modified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als carry sp@@ ammer on the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that secure their data .
over 50 percent of corporate IT leaders in the Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes Survey trust to be able to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the crimin@@ als pursue new strategies .
&quot; if encryption of data is no longer a sufficient threat to successful consider@@ ations , the perpet@@ rators rather threat@@ ens with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calcul@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin Kle@@ czy@@ n@@ ski .
this means damage potential depending on type of data is still a multiple higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could continue to put new goals in the internet of things in the future .
at the h@@ ack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers as they could have received with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocking heating could potentially be worth a ran@@ som .
when the perpet@@ rators can then block a whole production line in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and reliable .
Honda will pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe , and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually been very flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond , it does not work closely .
the materials of the interior are well processed and comfortable , only the cockpit @-@ top is falling out there .
even more versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
it is not only a luggage boot from 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ level and 10@@ 26 l at the fli@@ pped back @-@ back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bank can fold up like chin es@@ sel , and offer dust space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling .
the trunk is well loaded , but the charging height is 650 mm a little higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas very powerful .
he should , however , do something qui@@ eter with his work .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another engine is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
the equipment can be found in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; without any desires .
the City emergency braking system ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the spre@@ ader assistant is part of the security systems .
the coll@@ ision war@@ ns sometimes , because he has been rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ed@@ ah@@ ende objects . &quot;
the remote light super@@ visor works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed regulator respon@@ ds to the traffic identi@@ fier and lo@@ ot the speed when needed .
but the full connectivity is available only for the top @-@ equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two USB@@ - and a HDMI socket lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the nearly 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are OK .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline engine will receive 20,000 Euros , diesel from 23@@ 000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday suit@@ ability .
air@@ line is not responsible : down@@ fall to flight port
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argu@@ ed that liability is possible only in danger of danger .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap at the fall .
the accident could , however , could happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had no damage to the man .
disease : when paid the Organ@@ izer
due to their journey , we only get money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel .
but this is the case , if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family on the second day of her tur@@ k@@ age was heavily damaged in di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their disease had returned to a defective se@@ wage system , which allegedly poll@@ uted the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view that the trip was in@@ sufficient - and def@@ endants against the promot@@ ers .
the cla@@ im@@ ers had no success before the court .
although the se@@ wage plant was in fact defective .
but the organis@@ er only lear@@ nt just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then , he had to assume that the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information carriers , so judgment .
in the samples of water no imp@@ urities have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among each other - belonged to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were dise@@ ased .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violent acts of violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , many people would have worried about additional proposals in July .
the state must be so@@ ber and determined simultaneously on terror .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and cle@@ av@@ age .
we will not allow these triumph to terror@@ ists .
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , but the security and strength of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of proposals by 2017 .
he also announced another personnel rein@@ forcement of security forces , and &quot; in medium @-@ digit magn@@ itude for several years . &quot;
for terrorism , the symp@@ atics of terrorism will again stand under punishment .
video surveillance is to be improved , that it is so amended , that most of the weapons will be purchased on the Internet .
the last much discussed sweat of sweat is to be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
however , in dialogue with the trouble , he wants to look for solutions like the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said with a view on psychological immersion .
in order to counter@@ act an radi@@ c@@ alization of refugees , the minister keeps a better social support for necessary .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning its deployment .
the SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior clearly spoke against action .
&quot; that was a watch for the sni@@ per in the CDU / CS@@ U , Gabriel , Gabriel , said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ation ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the dual citizenship .
in a general ban , it is problem@@ atic problem@@ atic for constitu@@ tionally un@@ problem@@ atic .
you cannot offer everything you re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules about in road traffic or for witnesses .
green boss Simone Peter threw the minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages and action capacity .

better traffic flow on the motorway zu@@ b@@ inger
it st@@ aut regularly on the wal@@ k@@ way - here is a picture of November .
however , this should change : the legal turning point should be extended .
this is good news for all the car drivers who are driving in the traffic on the surrounding road every night in the St@@ au when they ride over the motorway ex@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the state @-@ operation road construction extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th @-@ 17th August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the departure Wes@@ eler Road by 700 metres .
drivers can turn right from the hammer road on the right .
the big advantage : traffic shares early on , whereby the total sequence is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ strasse 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District Court Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder is worried about the drivers from 17 to 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h trail and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the needle eye on the B 51 short before the Wes@@ eler Road .
from here , traffic will only be chann@@ elled on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ constructed before a three @-@ quarter years .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the necessary load capacity to absorb heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related stag@@ nation is ongoing , the state @-@ called state will not be able to say .
however , it is worth for years : because the bridge has an official rest time up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the lit@@ ig@@ ation , state operations consci@@ ously chose the traffic weaker time in the school holidays , because with disabilities .
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday , on the construction site .
inter@@ cultural Travel : cultural activities for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the boy Theater now are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning pieces &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster .
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; association , 19 students between eleven and 15 years organised the st@@ aging in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , who has set up cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rant and refugee background to the destination , schools with welcome leave the opportunity to visit the project cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the yo@@ ungst@@ ers were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ s , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible to follow the action process nevertheless the press release of the boy &apos;s theatre Münster .
the Verein N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration interest between 14 and 20 years will receive the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre and the@@ atri@@ cal language transmission are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope to improve weather

the night was badly suitable for clouds and rain because the sky spectac@@ le said , the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .

the weather should be good , then we will surely see many star@@ lings at the sky .
in the shooting stars it is Per@@ ei@@ den , which includes 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour to the fastest se@@ ag@@ ings .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping distur@@ ban@@ ces
in the evening you are getting around forever , at night , one is awake hours off , in the morning , the wake @-@ up is not getting enough to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep in@@ som@@ nia and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently re@@ covering .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there may be various reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for sleeping and sleeping medicine .
what you understand , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an in- and sleep@@ y disorder .
to sleep through sleep , many people find themselves as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German House Association in Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
it can include organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medicines .
not rarely is the sleeping disorder expression of a different disease .
&quot; very early Aw@@ ak@@ ening is common in a depression often , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that various factors thank each other .
who for example has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly lying , w@@ akes up all two to three hours and cat@@ ches up to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worry , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep with sleep disorders ?
those who sleep during a month in at least three nights per week should not sleep well and by day , should go to the doctor , says We@@ e@@ ß .
the impair@@ ment can look very different : it is unbe@@ aten , tired , un@@ balanced , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints like stomach or head@@ aches .
to relie@@ ve sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive Beha@@ vi@@ or or Drugs - classical sleep tablets only occur in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
in Germany , in Germany there is hardly st@@ resses that Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , head of the inter@@ disciplinary bedroom medical center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why you should start sleeping on the house@@ man at first , says We@@ e@@ ß .
this can clari@@ fy if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens there ?
for example , in the sleep laboratory , medical professionals advise the example of snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory failure , in case of sickness or if one does not find the cause of a sleep@@ y disorder , explain Fi@@ etz@@ e .
we do not have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
after the c@@ ud@@ dle you go to bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one we@@ ars a rhin@@ o@@ g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger .
in addition , a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping .
how can suffer@@ ers get the problems in the handle ?
there are rather many adjusting screws on which one can sit for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping and stop time , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , stopping drinking alcohol at night - then you start to count immediately , and that is quite and certainly not con@@ feder@@ ally .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he had brought gold for the first time in the World Championships in Doha , taking his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protecting his ex @-@ team @-@ mate in the criticism of his critics alike .
&quot; in a country where a Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king of 150,000 € should not wonder about lack of medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old was on his Facebook page in the night .
the feed system in the swimming sport is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good .
this way , we cannot compete with countries who do not promote so much and not even run on the topic of d@@ oping .
&quot; I am not saying that the controls are supposed to be set , &quot; he explained further .
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have been reported nine months before his initial launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who can &apos;t be able to control a certain time before F@@ WC / OS of independent Controll@@ ers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A can not participate , &quot; says the choice of choice ham@@ bur@@ gers , which now runs a ice cream .
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage arrested
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the Düsseldorf Airport
civil Federation of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer &apos;s police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday .
the susp@@ ect had committed several T@@ ash@@ - and luggage ste@@ els than ban@@ de .
at 21.@@ 30 the civil servants recognised a band again in the area of Dus@@ seldorf Airport , which had known the polic@@ emen from the past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ ac@@ ies since the mid @-@ July of this year and were very common , working , and especially professional .
the specialists of the Krimin@@ al@@ Com@@ miss@@ ariats 34 can follow the th@@ ie@@ ves who have traveled to Germany for author@@ isation of criminal off@@ ences .
they took over 15,000 Euros in total .
built on the first glance , the Rig@@ id Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain looks at the first glance : the Rig@@ id Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain looks not at first glance , but the police force it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
once you walk along the road from the east to the west , you pass on playing fields , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
on the facade of a grey house somebody has ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite to a Li@@ dl that will soon be demolished , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
article on this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , will be illustrated in the last few weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the occup@@ ying contracts on the ground floor are still rooms and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin &apos;s inner sen@@ ator handle it several times for a hard approach to the police against the project , called &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after the 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers have been evacu@@ ated , according to the police , three weeks from the official statements by the street , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers moved under the ju@@ ggle of sympath@@ iz@@ ants and inhabitants .
at this summer afternoon , the street works peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others are talking about late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a pine tree since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which is offered here three children , are largely driven by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects they share care about increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound after a pine , who wished for several police protection against v@@ andal@@ ous left .
the dig@@ ging that the Berlin &apos;s inner sen@@ ator and the police set up between house networks and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which is also a lower average of average in comparison to the rest of the city .
also home networks and the native projects have long been part of the Kiev : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under great police officers in a regular road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people today who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the quarter in the past few years has become increasingly an mag@@ nets for tourists and electoral lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them , residents of East @-@ times and former home networks operate with them .
this also makes itself noticeable in the rentals , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on the discs collected or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were cast into color @-@ bags .
no other road was mentioned this year as many times along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for that not all neighbours should be concerned as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : off@@ ense such as body vulner@@ ability , according to statistics , almost exclusively against police officers .
the largest part of the off@@ ences make atomic facts , the tend to meet new buildings and newly refurbished houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of un@@ certainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors who don &apos;t have been this .
even the famous burning cars do not give it directly in the ri@@ gs no longer .
for studying Archit@@ ec@@ in , its road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
curiosity is consci@@ ously moved to the rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
that &apos;s why it was so important that local residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly appeared to the interpretation of the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : character@@ less new@@ buildings in former building sites that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants .
&quot; it is ultimately con@@ current dwellings , which are not interesting for many people - here are people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; she says .
&quot; I cannot feel violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should one do , if anyone does not listen to anyone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including police and the inhabitants .
for assign@@ ments which are shar@@ pen@@ ed beyond colour bom@@ bers , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to a pine .
who moves , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub , can complain badly about noise .
all people with the names presented above have asked , not to be named with their correct name

Reg@@ ine customer indicates that the honorary more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , that deu@@ sch@@ le is , the ei@@ vable Wol@@ l@@ mil@@ ch@@ au , which has a problem above all .
so some - less mo@@ cking as rather , as rather on the variety of desired tasks , meant - meant as the administration wanted to write the place .
a management expert for many languages and people , linked to a long@@ time experience in the field of social work , is an ins@@ ati@@ ent wool of wool .
however , administrative work is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le means .
above all , it will go to organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
since about six weeks , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been involved .
it has reduced a 50 @-@ percent point to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and full official players are supported .
there are big and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers appear in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a grave problem for some time to find apartments for connecting wings that have been recognized .
the municip@@ alities are responsible for the connection of the connection .
you have to teach refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municip@@ alities themselves .
the responsibility is changes from the district advis@@ ory board to Commun@@ e and Job@@ Center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time and very difficult .
de facto the administration is not found in private apartments .
do not work until now , be dependent on private apartments so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , gener@@ alized apartments have to be replaced as it is so beautiful .
so new containers are soon erected in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm lead , there are internship plac@@ ements , training places , one @-@ Euro jobs and hel@@ mets for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ ressed or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non@@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes the work for the community leads to a positive impact .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
activity does not only mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would need to develop a balance feeling .
so it offers offers like sports , contacts with locals and mainly language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so , here also administ@@ er administration and honour .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are wanted in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees , that it takes their time to bridge them , for example with language courses .
who eventually developed the feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be un@@ profitable but never will integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
problem cases are there however , also , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people , at which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two of the most recent events in fear of radi@@ c@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; what more man@@ cher is calling nai@@ ve . &quot; a rem@@ n@@ ate can , but does not exclu@@ de it .
but the hel@@ pers are rather sensiti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are subject to refugees .
they had the fear that the attacks bring them completely in demand .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so we have to look out major and volunteer on site and in the region to activities .
they always have in the background that a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
the policy is clear to answer this question .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we would like to go , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that Ur@@ g@@ bacher should also be able to in@@ corporate the previous person .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
