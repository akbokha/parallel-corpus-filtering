<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the pyramid of the pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited some colleagues with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a couple of minutes the horses remembered her solemnity, they pursued at the fast gallop home to the food.</seg>
<seg id="7">A few kilometres at this pace, I'm afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the equestrian career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 victories - once again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not let go for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen, and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe was handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala's Golden Sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">Honours it does not lack the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Constitutional Court, Silver, Lorberry leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen left him already.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th winner of the pyramid of the pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means me a lot," says Langer, "for it will not only be awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer promotes the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued to win the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the "Hall of Fame of the German Sports."</seg>
<seg id="24">For the excellent are the athletes of Hartwig Gaudi and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fuska Frank Kolbe, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the sprinkler of Alwin Shockemöhle and posthum of the Handbook of All Erhard Wonderful.</seg>

<seg id="5">The, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep it small in doubt and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to euvise the economy and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, claims trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will repay regulators, and it is strong for an extensive tax reform with lower taxes - for individuals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, it says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To invests in the shots, Trump and Clinton almost worshiped.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical Tefly wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump could be more partisan discussion.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are clearely.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and the coal extraction in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in far-protected areas to cancel the Paris climate deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton plan to expand the renewable energy with its investment programme, and demands: "one country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazide-fish agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">But both the United States don't want to isolate the US from international trade, but only American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, Clinton calls for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a Hungerwages.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump doesn't want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, The minimum wage must be rushed, then he says, He must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop into the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics observe him before, that the budget deficit would only grow bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clinton is on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand more taxes, and their critics saying: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every fledged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who are alone to flee, almost at everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her small son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares to the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normally.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the division managing director of Condrobs, a carrier for social help in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no more men - neither as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a wax before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated say: every woman who reaches here has made experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are pursuing politically because they cause torture or death, or because their families are sending them to Europe," she says.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, others weigh over other reasons for the escape: "many steal it secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honourable, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">It drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, the tractor call for a bottle of water a sexual action is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too the women in refugee practices would often be considered as inferior and worst case abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This causes approximately 90 percent of women who live in the housing in Munich, is traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily developed."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so familiar to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">As they often don't hesitate to help, it simply need more accommodations for her.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">To the question, whether they were using a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with No.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken there is no such thing in accommodations of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben alone, women are not separated and said Karl-Heinz Meyer, press precher of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Lower and Central Franks there are in some common dormitories on floors or their homes only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study which has been published for the committee, it says: "it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"lacks privacy or men and women together, it can come to - ongoing violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the washrooms should be separate and accessible to women, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much women feel this protective need, one can read on the Andalese who gives it to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since you have been around, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily create a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">The assistants have called upon their union to approve new labour measures in their dispute regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) demanded its entire Council, from the beginning of September more labour measures to be approved.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that it would have given minister to initiate the worries regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistants and medical students have agreed in July on the rejection of a contract with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening on Twitter, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained steady in case of problems, which led to the agreement that the contract was rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said, "in view of this, the JDC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official resignment to all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating labour measures that begin at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the inarians of this year were sixties, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA Assistants of Dr. Johann Malawana came back to rejection of the agreed contractual conditions that had been advised by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He shared BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote of 54.000 assistants and medical students, with that the contract should be advantageous and accepted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and an official end of the eight month long lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterpart in the gilded room of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot defend myself from the rucks that Ankara wants to be most reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be narrowly and he is radiant heat, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day she described a newspaper that Erdogan would have been so blurable than would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling was shown that Russia's state of affairs had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane to the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin split and accused Ankara, who fell into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was even bigger as it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetroen rebuild is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the nationally controlled media led a sharp, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would have to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the serious test, the accusations of senior civil servants, that, had benefited from illegal oil trading in regions of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this thing.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan takes first line all friends that he can get after spending last month at a failed coup d "état nearly of his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and Charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attraction to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television endorsed fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrary imports will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this way: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West, since the response to which tried to take power over weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the ongoing groll will come across the EU's accession negotiations and Putin - the gout on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian President won a bonus for the attempted coup d "état for the elected state of state.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is well-evident for Moscow to understand self-understanding that himself has a deep sitting in front of regimes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glittering palace of the sea allowed it Russia and Turkey, one as it described me a analyst, "alliance of outsider": two countries who violate themselves from the West and feel poorly treated and now allied on.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave up the role as Nobel Peace, but where Russia and Turkey support opposites.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours of first calls both President responded to the press conference that they would not even have invaded the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately replied on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than NATO member of Turkey, it is certainly better that the two leaders will talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the Board of Staff, RBS has to be reduced to a backoffice part according to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside of Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand had merged with the global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Bank has changed since then, when she had to be almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this time brand names "RBS" have used to protect other consumer finance brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">It supported international sport with millions of pounds on sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to move more national brands in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all RSB references, head office and the IPO are exchanged to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other brands for private clients that get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB will be employed to our investor brand, as well as to the brand, under which our employees will be busy, as we are now more to a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">As the Bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, I say that we are not pursuing any global goals, but local objectives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own congregations, and our employees will work with these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsorship and that it will increase the convenience of various brands in its Sport-Sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop the brands of brands, as we are asked inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Chairman of the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Three years ago it would have been very cynical when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori sprays champagne after a double by Newmarket, which brings to him 3.000ten profit</seg>
<seg id="3">The Jockey Frankie Dettori assured his 3.000ten British gain at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He sat on Predilection, trained by John Gosdes, on his local circuit with his second win of the night a milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey which reaches milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-time winner Dettori, who had won on Ghayyar, said: "it is something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I am very emotional because my family is here too</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy about it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it is not Royal Ascot, it's a mundane Friday evening with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes the cheers, when he gets the victory at Predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two Jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derbyseger had 4,493 diamonds</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best Jockey of the modern age and it's no surprise that he reached this milestone, which only a few before it met him.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that differs from the other in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma enthusiastically enthusiastically for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he had already fetched 6,000 winnings if he would not only be a weekend and big turnierjockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has had a winner in the UK for nearly 30 years, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of British flat race for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was annoying.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "glorious Seven" in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug abbot.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago he had difficulty in the beginning, when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive strength to beat his two flyers and to return to his top.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he is still not at the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his minimum of 50.ten years.</seg>

<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it is called (in Russian) that later he later was a protocol of protocol and staff of government officials.</seg>
<seg id="10">Regarding his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of law for legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the ridiculous faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has been mysterious in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the most engaging trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for the Soviet secret services, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the mightiest men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin who was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once glorified as an potential president would lead to the Russian environmental policy - pushed on large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin who are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I had asked you in early 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated item - you could almost say - complaining of four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal War Crimes Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin addressed the power, he called Ivanov as one of five people who trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov might have been President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third reign of Putin could violate the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 weights.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown had a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go down from the land to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic degree with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closing between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate work that require extremely precise tolerances for fitting.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge in their place and the last section of decks today will receive a betongation for the deck today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure is the pioneering high- and deep-building.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last street cover and the connection with the north-country deck, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the North Cape bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of approximately 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heats up because the tolerances that the team were working, were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child for playing no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens at rigid, was sued in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Pokemon Go, it is about to bring people out of the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the beginning, the screen was on the TV set, then on video games and lastly on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities are not open to each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm looking forward to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were created on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later arose from a animation series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sunk the interest in the publication of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was moved by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon go more users than inks, and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphone outside and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured" can be captured.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wreck and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that rejects the "average" of every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who pursues 35,000 users, shared the number of people's launch in two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed every day 30 minutes, who jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data for performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to bring it "to take" 30 minutes "to be" "from the sofa" and "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sport can not be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances to ill cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that too long is to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful of Pokémon Go is that there will bring people to do something in the open, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mürg game destroying that must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports, as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and let it be used with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to poker success, there will be more games to get the apps and virtual reality with the active will be combined in the real world and so many people are going to hunt, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-class struggle and a total of the fifth, while it solidifies its reputation, the best of its generation or even ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final score was shown and her long journey found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success makes them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles dominated the sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals, including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, which is awarded a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton from her said she was "the best gymnast in which I ever saw."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a last review in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="25">It has not lost any more competition competition since the summer of 2013, a victory series that will hold so long as it wishes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I introduce myself to the Women Olympics in Turnen and this from more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, since 1984 I joined the Summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie's "Laurie" Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the Catholic is round, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This crew finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has defied the black and Hispanic feminine presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one amongst female singers was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is showing strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible power of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpectedly, but masterful gymasticroutinen.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual criminal event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Crew member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the tip of this sport, but look at gym classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way like Aly and Madison, to make it an Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality sees that Turnen is a expensive sport and Turner first place in private gyms, who are maintained by parents for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competitiveness and hotel costs (for the trainer and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in wealthy suburbs which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts received all their training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainee of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, both trained her athletes since they started with the Turnen.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the municipalities Aun countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easier access training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have both free and affordable gymnast in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics that earn the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnes develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and identification for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and professional and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that thousands of young girls are interested in interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team Mongol and thank you, so many young girls motivate with different background to start their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant dentists want to organize further strikes after Jeremy Dog proposal rejected proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to terminate the argument by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistants who vote in a choice, declined.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt plans reveal the contract to adopt the contract, and said that the NHS had been insisted in a "Niemandsland" and would have had any further delay for the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend packages to improve the care of the working hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">DR Ellen McCourt, the president of the BMA Commentary Committee for assistants shared last night in a communication with: "Assistants to heat up serious concerns, in particular that it will heat up the current staff rise and bring it to treat all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks left, until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute by talks during the government on the contradiction to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">That happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just made it last month, that his door would always open up.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lifting up the condition and address the concerns of assistants."</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do this, the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to carry further labour measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a boost of almost 13,000 routines and 100,000 terminations, as nurses and specialists have been involved in order to give doctors on the strike string cover.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute over the changes through an acceptance of the reformed Treaty by the functioning of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants to be a better weekly remuneration for the 54.000 assistants that are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS employee, asked the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "labor disputes achieve nothing of the only little, but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, care and their families only worries, distress and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last two months, we talked to the Department of Assistants and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries had a positive response to the concerns of the atrium and Whistclowings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that this continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility during training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training courses and the Ministry of Health regarding the observance of the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a £2 per day drug, after being advised by the authorities to give it more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The odorant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The medication is administered 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NHS regulation system has recommended a four-year long ingestion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by assumptions of fatty materials in the arterial walls that form the pads.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the Belag breaks apart, it can cause blood flow to clogged the blood flow up to the heart and caused a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the blood clots loose, it can flow through blood flow and clogged the flow of blood to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who had already had a heart attack, subject to a higher risk to have another risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the Brilique trade name, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="13">The call design of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE health insurance company said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack, a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin effectively in reduction of other heart attacks and strokes in people who had already a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Due to a provisional recommendation by Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - above all the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years. the draft bill does not recommend any treatment that goes beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com might make it a bit safer.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to move about distance with armed incers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are approached from the back, then you should be able to turn your attackers so that you can see your attackers and "go out of the line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab your gun then between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him then with the knee into the strip and turn the weapon out of pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">Attackers, which approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the line, grab the weapon and rotate it, so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time you relocate the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of his handle before moving backwards and set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi predictive.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that at a prey on the safest, your money is too rich - unless you are not a Krav Maga Grandmaster.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rice Ian Wright shabt for a guide to his tongue in the dirty places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller signed the immune system and the worms of severe testing by leased out some of the most polluted places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The host and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk sawed his course on a euro note, a margins at Piccadilly Circus, a carrying knob on a tractor toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before dropping each object, he used an Luminometer to show and let us show what he is going on.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strith," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to wipe the purging button of a tractor toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely disgusting, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily left nothing, he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intestine by going through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to rushing knobs of toilets, the task set its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">He told the film: "already as a kid I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was justified in his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing that he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its probezel showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refine after their Luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands showed one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner 'Strith," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "this comes to the worst thing I got stuck in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing cleaner than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick up here, because it is a solitary one here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strith" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producers of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led mad brainstormings by which we sent "Lass us to call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film directs, said: "let me say it so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, when he would have tasted some of the things I have instructed him, like the eclipse Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian, to lick it and others, with which it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents were involved in particular with the wellbeing of stomach and intestine and 58 percent, that they may use at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">A asocial family left their social dwelling after a delay with a damage in the amount of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were violently removed from their property, there was a shocking staff of housing corporations in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls are ensing holes on, wooden panels were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were moved and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said they were not afraid to repair the apartment.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said, "It was an absolute mare for the people here and I am the view that people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, as this property is thought to be considered not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is also notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the flat in the meantime and the police told that the terror that had joined the family, struggles with baseball bat, drug abuse, drug trafficking, drug stores and excessive screaming.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which will be demolished under circumstances, old garbage was found</seg>
<seg id="14">They were found in the property where drugs were traded on drugs called wood panels.</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to be called by police regularly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deletes her and her partner violently from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to educate them voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">Delogation were cheered by lightened neighbours, so they said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One thing said, "They were not ashamed."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we are talking about the police are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - that's not usual!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now, where they are gone, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager from Cornwall Housing, said that it would have been given the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals, 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the superior side of the house house trash and old toys was thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that it is a shame to adopt the tenant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as a delay is always the last step into account by Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">That was a very difficult case, since the behaviour was extremely long and their deeds should be horrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development is donating some neighbors, and the message conveys that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they are all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after deling on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the country office will now have to dign a garbage dump which surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, police launched a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as orphans, parapes and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine of fine after they had found guilty of the possession of a class B in trading foresight.</seg>
<seg id="36">They claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner is now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many rooms of the house were graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that they will delimitate tenants, who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow, by the police of Devon and Cornwall, shared a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare-Year, the Salzburg Festival presented the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With this a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernsteins masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra conducted by the Venezuelan artist Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernsteins music really in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging Bartoli plays a older Mary.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers the groaning of her lovers with Tony, while the younger Maria is playing and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because they are musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I Feel Pretty, oh so Pretty, I Feel Pretty and witty and Bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it is clever, of course also naive, and very passionately.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it resembles me very, my Italian character I have as a tube," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the Opera: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honor to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is a tremendously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is an extraordinary artist and very passionately!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in any of his movements, in his gaze, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a very southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story": "in this piece it is about prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the buffers went to New York, and they did not want to go to New York.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same themes, and they are as well as meaningful as then.</seg>

<seg id="2">"who doesn't fit and Erdogan is attacking," says the chairman of the Gülen-near foundation dialogue and world, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish municipality in Germany will soon expect tens of thousands of protection seeking out from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand" believes the Supreme Leader Ali Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after the coup attempt, the Kurdish Church of Germany anticipates a mass evasion to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, medium term, with some hundred thousand protection seeking out of Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime is fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Commission president Ali Toprak in the "World" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government had passed the Kurdish high burners with Strafaktions, 500,000 Kurds have been on the run within Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the turkey coup, the secular and oppositioning of ethnic Turks would add.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start in Europe when they are going to be oppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state who raises refugees in their own country," said Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chief of staff complained to Syrian Arab in Kurdish, but also in alevitarian towns.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thereby Erdogan would raise the pressure to the left Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or sold in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also an CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chief of Staff urged that the Federal Government will be "as sharp as Austria's position against Erdogan and his followers."</seg>
<seg id="15">In Germany, a "witch-hunt" is held against Erdogan critics.</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also feared the escape of many Turks.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks are seeking asylum in Germany, mainly Kurds and opposition.</seg>
<seg id="19">Fire marking as a Gülen trailer destroys teachers and other academics for professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who doesn't fit and Erdogan is attacking, by the way, the Kemalists and secular" said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near foundation dialogue and education, the "world."</seg>
<seg id="21">As reported by the newspaper, by calling on figures from the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Turks occupied the largest group of political persecution of asylum in Germany before Putsch.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the reporting date June 30, this 11,386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all rights have been recognised (39.625).</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives do not receive anything from the summer campaign with - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not vote on the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the daily election will not be held once again at the end of the summer holidays, the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because so far it does not go: summer holidays, heat and landrush era - it bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The natives, who are to be convinced by the fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most tourists who are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen, or Hiddensee, are no locals, so do not vote on the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers are wind up, distributing balloons, flyers, flyers and end votes.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to drop once again a campaign for election with the election and final election day.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say that at all has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998 strongest party, is now clear in polls behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomer AFD cuts and what remains to the end of coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 government of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from its major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, spread out roses, and chat a little with the people, as it already did his legendary advocate predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors got cold feet and is Chancellor Merkel the debt of AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, "We create" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" we create "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with their nickname data, the Minister of Defense Lorenz Caffier, has experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to granddaughter; Merkel parliament is located in the north east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," Sarah Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is no one to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel listen.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast of the CDU comes largely on marketplaces and shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thus, Kokert, plays only a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that you cut off the base on the ground that it has to be very strict, again to find a wire to people.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly available in the areas of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the council of the CDU-presidential army Kokert is self-declaring: "they must go where it hurts where people are: Dorothy, Golden weddings, each birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot has stood on the game, Sellering has called his SPD as a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys the social democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just close to AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD still gained an impression of 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small partisan, with seven percent in the polls, should have the leap into the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue of holiday, and discard its campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," it is the president of Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green donors go on spurensue to domestic stimuli among the tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top datin, curvt straight with a houseboat through the mecklist lakes and finds it even beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Their impression: "electoral holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 Refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about speed, with which the B 27 is renovated.</seg>
<seg id="3">The works were responsible for the works of construction, which begin at 5.30 in the morning, and end only at 20 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made all pretty shaky," Elvira Tetzlaff tells of the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The building site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the beginning of October, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opposite will also be praised to work, for example when it comes to the establishment of heating drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the building site moved to the south on Monday and also the lock of the Aspergeinfstraße in Ofterdingen was abolished and thus also the connection to Rottenburg is back, the traffic situation within the resort was relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now return from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic flows through the place seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly considerable discomfort," says the Deputy Head of the Deputy Head of the Director Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many creeping paths seeking and rather their Navi trusted as the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some trucks lost in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As well as the speed limiting were not kept, the church increasingly urged to sing the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself a location on the location itself.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute were born.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest way was on the way at 77 km in pace in the pace of the pace.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For business people at the B 27, it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 renovation led to the sales of the B 27, each one asks you to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However some are some more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who has less to do with the "end customer" so for other firms, the rehabilitation have hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximum slight decline," but also, of course, "the impetus is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The local along the road are most exploited.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds distinct words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have met "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">We were missing the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be glad about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sales revenue was reduced to "far over 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">The street saw his operation "back for two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a firm of 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt acted on a request by Göhner, if it could provide a financial compensation, otherwise it benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now they also read the disadvantages caused by the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows about other regions where something generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all suits, Göhner is sure that his host will continue to pass.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other common guests can now see less often because of the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't travel, it's elsewhere nice too.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his ancestor has returned to the end of the refurbishment, Göhner has no doubts about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises of BSE and a bird flu Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the greatest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in their long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Constantly in the name of counter-terrorism will be screwed to laws.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Compromisers.</seg>
<seg id="6">All of his proposals are politically vulnerable to the coalition, says the Minister of domestic ministers on the performance of his new safety package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are looking for no one.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, further points would initially be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm also betting on it too.</seg>
<seg id="10">But as Minister of Interior, however, it is located on results and in a "coverable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has taken a little time, before he presented its conclusions for the security of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But now they all fall into the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some is already known, announcing that a new security authority should take care of encrypted communications, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany needs to implement multiple EU requirements for passenger data and weapons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities does not come unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière starts a second start for proposals which have not been made with the SPD: he wants to put the sympathies for terrorist groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="18">He still kept this for reasonable and demands nothing, which has no chances in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presented de Maizière also.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is partly in itself: it plans quick printing process for deportations and more possibilities to arrest people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who targeted targeted to the country should check their smartphone in advance and place social media accounts for a safety check.</seg>
<seg id="22">For some expatriots for expired asylum seekers, he wants to put some more badly than ever - such, the offences, or deliberately throw away their papers to wear their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legally.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some even seem unbalanced and is open to questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And for some points - with the inequality of tolerances for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be understood that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg have been refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many people also worry about security at the high number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people are deeply impressed by the people, did not let him go out in election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is stretched enormously in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The pollution is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are choices.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD can thus increasingly lead to internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days there went high between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garanty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions of Interior Minister, in which the Ressorts also call for a Burka ban and a return of double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière goes also here to reconcile notes.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a double-pass he doesn't hold anything.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">They reproduce, be not meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And with a burka-prohibition he has constitutional objections.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is inconstitutional to all the corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, only has to show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot of things that could provide for dispute.</seg>
<seg id="45">The SPD, however, is currently trying to profiling the inner safety.</seg>
<seg id="46">Partenef Sigmar Gabriel is not signalized only once more careful and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety."</seg>

<seg id="8">The VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles worldwide in July with 449100 cars than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, the deliveries are almost a six-sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Head office CEO Jürgen Stackmann introduced the weaker numbers from July, particularly on two sales days less in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Thursday, Bankboss Josef Paul said: "it's only about 139 customers to park 40 million euros on giro- or daytime."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bundesverband German banks is talking about a single incident and does not see the signal: normal savings would have to be afraid to pay for their austerity penalty. "</seg>
<seg id="4">To store banks over night at the European Central Bank (ECB), you must pay a 0.4 per cent penalty.</seg>
<seg id="5">This fee requires the Raiffeisen Bank Gmund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on giro- or daytime accounts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the first 100,000 Euros are free."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the next 100,000 costs in the future will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.</seg>
<seg id="8">He ported over a time of 40 million euros, which could be withdrawn from one day to another, and could not be verified.</seg>
<seg id="9">"they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs," said the banker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I can't put €4,000 for each million."</seg>
<seg id="11">The cost will now continue after the causal principle.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who is buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle aged plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to comment under the pseudonym, not to sow them under a pseudonym, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the versatile recovery of sound plates doesn't want to go to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the news from physical objects but to Midlife-Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have purchased a record recently are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through Hobbysammers - it has an emotional significance. older flat runners maintain their feelings more (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the findings of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I carry out a humble street in Soho, a modest houndant, before I stop, my hands keep my hands and something serious: "so, let us look at a close look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos has moved slowly to his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I had sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) to Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This record, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him at home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy items that he had sold, when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I had probably been too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He's right to those who buy plates, more introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds: "I smoke not and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">GMT, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers apply to meet YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and prompted to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations that I have led, people usually have to empty their collection as a rule in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy again their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realise that record shops offering a soothing community of parables.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to get back to the stability of familiar sound shells, from objects which give happy attention.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or ownership of materials possessions than any kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's about me as collectors and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" reddish an employee from a stack of stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people bought a record for the last month they haven't been heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a turntable that they never use while 7% of those who buy one plate, no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I puzzled through a stack of Bossa Nova Scotations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data: three men middle ages), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone first came here recently and said," I don't own turntables, but I would like to buy a radio ead, so I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More production loads, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older they come out slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the record records almost a whole floor, has a pale audience when I clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are pairs of 70, tourists, the photos make, teenager and women of middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts of latest synthesizer and experiment pop instead of experimental jazz boasting from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange but relatively short psychic traumas are hard to detach if you stand for someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a shovary globete than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, therefore, collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a love grower.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of record holder is supposed to have inspired: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the appearance to sample the jeans hotell, I watch a group of young teenagers, which can be grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter think to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees her - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far that it is impossible to address them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, although the one is the most suitable for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov showed, at least in ceries in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record teachers that exist in reality, clash stores and Onlineforen exist.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are likely to work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">You will spend your Thursday morning with safety not with the Bummeln through record shops of Berwick Street and the sheets through plates, while holding the starring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator that overlooks the shoulders of any middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a hearing treatise this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be entitled to sell 72 provisional shops within the camp commodities, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel business, of which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and the risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by the nationally supported union and other groups, not enough food for growing numbers in stock.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the assigning of people who operate the 72 provisional business, but spatially that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "are absolutely traceable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes, and restaurants would play much more important than just people living in extreme preventive conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that were threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is generally profitable and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors in stock.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure of "for this children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years old are."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain with 7-er Rugby came on Thursday evening to a abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in the handling, side steppes, descending, liner, and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic-edaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was versed by the non-bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they fought in New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the bok, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on it in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji had smitten with this form a 15-man team in the top form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a gold medal will hang up a gold medal for tomorrow: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England of Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost among Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This loop will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to be wonderful and let the attacks go from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. run as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau came in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With an even four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai put another attack on the right hand, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly set the ball.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vacco Ravouvou prebred by further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the pause.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's so as if Fiji had been born to play the 7, while the UK is still in seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is that way.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB made basic changes to half-time by and closed the fijianic gap... for all four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through to a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favour of the South African consular whose fans sank and danced on the grandstand.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through the fight with the cancer of the trainee to the rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no fan of an engine than with these games, and that's what we want.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing period to the last, 220 hard Hieve which enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra importance in their golden moment at Estacio del Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it were only those who were sitting on the rod, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainee Robin Williams, was more present than they laid the second Olympic champion in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports which gave such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter was unworthy, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of Triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing a battalion found a bion on the willing helpers that make the difference and it was no one of the trainer, who didn't know if he would survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the season, what the interruption was to a minimum, if that is the correct term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it soon had to go better.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing on itself is already a challenge, but it makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inaccurability of the victory their first thoughts came to Williams, who had a nerved morning to talk something more than anything else, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was as captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I said this week an emotional wreck. that might be something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore, a massive thanks go to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have wished for better person or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with whom their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark have taken up, Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very well at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process." stay in the process. "</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get caught up.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make something rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventure of Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">It feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, health: singing, seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">Singen has accompanied Ursel Kipp already her entire life: as young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching position and today she sings the 78-year-old in a senior citizen choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physically," she describes it.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a sample, she feels more balanced, cheerful and a total of living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By doing so she does something good with her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is equal to several perspectives, a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most Seniors sang in chorus and share with parables the joy of music, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular collaboration, seniors may establish social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because they often solve social and familiar structures in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir: "extracting and organize, to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, meaning Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">The seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who demands his lungs, even in everyday life not as fast as Puste.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz tells us about the Federal Labour community in the seniors-organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song lyrics and particularly melodies, people have lost its sick people in long past events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, a particular performance is required for singing, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on their own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone are not just to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition we travel through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I'm so long for something, I'll get better and watch over me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, he advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - with 50 sinking people, who can hear when a sound comes to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of suitable offer senior citizens have different ways, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone will sing someone from the old circle in an old choir, you can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can directly turn to the church or the church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also find many senior choirs over the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who have no access to the Internet can ask friends, friends or neighbors for the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, it should be joined by a choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul well and has a bit of liberating - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="9">It will not be taken before football.</seg>
<seg id="10">The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the previous Starkicker Hakan Sükr.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to this, Sükr is now being accused of being a member of the terrorist group in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sükr is alleged to be the follower of the Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who will be responsible for the coup attempt at President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is true, initially for 90 days, the state of emergency was pending before October, in fact, in fact, the life of most Turks, however, has no effect on the life of most Turks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erdogan's nightly "democracy guards" on public places throughout the country has said Erdogan on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sports is like the whole country - split in followers and enemies of Erdogans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Especially fans of the Club of Besictas are traditionally not among the friends of the President.</seg>
<seg id="17">But what the Turks attack the Turks face dramatic experiences in history is strictly refusal of military coup.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether your heart beats to Galatasaray or Besictas.</seg>
<seg id="19">At Pokalsieger "Gala" it will take place especially on Lukas Podolski.</seg>

<seg id="29">"we have made it and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="30">For Master Besiktas the playing year went better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 season buffers as the South-Lig-Torprotective case, the foundation laid the base for the 14th title.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the 31 year old.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the same time, the Gomez was under contract with the Treaty of Florence and will not be announced at Besictas, because of the political situation in the country after his EM-holiday.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if Mario wants to come to us, he must say it," quoted the magazine "Kicker" Clubman Fikret Orman.</seg>
<seg id="35">But if the falls would have to do this, however, if one third of his 7.5 million euros would have to do an estimated annual salaries, Orman said: "his salary at Florence can't pay."</seg>

<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old ended with a backing of 48 seconds and reserved the 59th place of 59 star.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was not his very sporty figure, which attracted the attention of international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24-year-old participates in the Olympics?</seg>

<seg id="18">The comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the Olympic Games of 2000 in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussammundi took care of medial attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from the Äquatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in an overflow over 100 m Freestyle alone.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at the back then.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim for eight months before the Olympia, and never had a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased by then, if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the pertinent calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf is then 4,37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported that the budget was determined through the household and Kulmbach, so that wastewater systems have undergone undercoverings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the legal basis of the market, the market is obligated to operate facilities.</seg>
<seg id="6">Starting from 1 October 2016, the citizens and industrial enterprises from the world traveller, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have to intervene deep into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Head of Herbert Schmidt to the Panel, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater treatment was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or subcovering from the previous period of the period will be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because of all three sewage plants, Schmidt established that it is relatively small facilities with a very low sewage plant which lie between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs would end up several thousand Euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, the sewage rise in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the reclining period of all three plants were not least due to their age refurbishment and repair charges in a significant extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for the gave birth, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt demonstrated that in the wastewater system Azendorf had to replace the mechanical ventilation system due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping work, which had to overtake over 20 years of old conveyor systems, which had to be outdated after nearly 20 years of operation of the first septic pond, the septic tank has to be disposed of, and an additional ventilation can also be installed in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "for these extraordinary expenditures, the ongoing service and maintenance costs were considered to be considered in the new scope of calculations."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs which were still evident at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made clear that in the three plant wastewater wastes had to be fully crossed for the operation and maintenance. "</seg>
<seg id="20">According to this, Schmidt, added the market for major maintenance costs in the wastewater plants last 20 years, has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to stay focused on time, especially when it is not possible to extend the supply area of the sewage system Friesenbachtal for these facilities, because it is about deficit facilities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, the Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that is already known to the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are intact, unique design tools that generate more than 30 million improved selections per day.</seg>

<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have put criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the App Blackface promoting or white skin would propagate as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some Ups proposed a filter, which gave them slit, wrong teeth and intrued cheeks, some critics identified a racist caricature of Asians - "jaunted out."</seg>
<seg id="9">They questioned whether this repeated checkered has occurred on a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The messages and the Outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told that it would have had the feature downlighted.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an excuse: the filter was intended to pay homage to Anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism, reminded the filter to infringing cllichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Other refused the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani wrote a Korean American student, whose tweet was widespread over the photos that the filter "violently and were told uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">It added that "it is difficult to argue with the counterpart of a very conflicting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>

<seg id="2">Military deployment of the United States Central Command changed payment information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, as it would allow the actual states on-site to report an investigation committee on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a task force of republican members, secret service providers and military budgette, reported by great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Conysts, reported how attitudes towards American efforts changed against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"news service information, which were typically embroidered by high-level CentCom Commander as it would have been authorized to have the actual states on-site, and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," cited a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened to CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, republican Member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">CentCom's leadership errors are to be held to the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed clinical problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct evidence to change the government pointed out of Obama's instructions, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press releases, opinions and statements were clearly more positive than it corresponds to facts" presented the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">As an example, CentCom affiliated to CentCom was publicly announced that a military deployment of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, second city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, is so much clear." Mike Pompeo said, republican congress from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 up to the middle of 2015, the tips of Central Command changed the night security reports to record the danger through ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force after them, that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway by the General Government of the Defense Department.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Democratic Members of the News Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively limited process for the creation of guidelines on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," commissioned Adam B. Schiff, a member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, so Mr. Schiff, "delayed publication of subsequent intelligence," dismissed the moral under analysts and "was excessive enough space for differing opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats were given no evidence of having found evidence of an intervention of the White House at CentCom analysts as regards a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations have been published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported about investigating the Pentagon promoted to complaints from CentCom Analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press review of the Pentagon, was published in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not have reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the general inspection course was still underway.</seg>

<seg id="26">The investigations have passed through the question of a successful air campaign through US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have rejected the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honourable military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">Criticism concerning the impedance of the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago when CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, looked at the recommendations of many analysts in Iraq and had little time to negotiate on the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to establish government points that would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since this provisional refineries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentComs damaging commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, a Englishman, trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"one change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work time in London we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can completely hit the rod completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen on the first half of the game with a back hand blow from the near range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without victory in the game, but the team showed himself surprisingly tough and held the pitch of 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved the ball in the center to get the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of all tournament for the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Exactly like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," Parnham said, but how good will depend on Saturday's outcome.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Olympics of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and inevitable, a fast relay of competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is fed by the Crossbow to the Turner to the Triathleten.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the Coffeshop, without having Simone Biles, Katie Leap, or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman of women with dimples, would have been among those known names that would have been sent to Prime Time, being built by sponsors and feel-TV advertising if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Fusey.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event right away.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports which are not universally recognized: airnozzles, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the nipple swimming and may rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should really make arguments for my particular darling, then let me direct attention to the discrete charm of the Trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the tramp has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had his debut in Sydney, the last 16 years was perceived so many that I had asked, did not know that there is a Olympic champion for ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes on the Contests, it has never had a medal on a trampoline, and had had a athlete up until 2012, who made it until the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese, and the Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The jumping on the trampoline has some outdoor page charme, partly because it sounds more appropriate for a clownsschool than that for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a herdding enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of gyms and docking, the two sports which essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard".</seg>
<seg id="22">Jump off on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, cough and sage) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be assessed according to the official Olympics on execution, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Six-year athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight forward.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, upwards and steeply, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and back, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall, but in the television broadcast also another polite destination: the world or the Olympic Tower.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even add a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when looking this games as something exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breath-break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A moving movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jump from, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no cabrian into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant uplifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time, the men on Saturday also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a follow-up block at both days and 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness can be reached only by the Angular and the objectification of male athletes, according to the The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his after air, a new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">A generation protesting "in Ethiopia, Long is a ally of ally</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, seeking political changes in Ethiopia, violate violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig-workers were killed during clashes with the police at Schussers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia my right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid association with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shattered the land and spread in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed to streets and asked fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses were told that policemen were shot and killed inarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, there are videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security officers were young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now asking a thorough research.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in future it will even become more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is cherished from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in considerable speed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendulum in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continuously have led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, with dissidents become effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed, or put into the vast expanses of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and don't have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," told Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopies.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire Youth is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to digging in regards to power of ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions down the border to Eritrea; a fight for this hacky, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists were like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, protecting the turbulence in recent years and could rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the deterioration after years of age-ankles will explode on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, very many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media since cheap smartphones were becoming increasingly common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government freaks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, above all in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians showed, that they were gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethanol in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">There have been a prospering of the Amharas, which mainly come from eopia, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and live in flat regions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this changes straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia dominates unfair by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which comprise around 6 per cent of the population, and the military, dominant in the intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-public disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a visual genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was especially referred to to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special officials to process opponents and to make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is lack of this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came out of the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts agree that he enjoys not the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time, Ethiopia was such an uproar, since the thousands of elections were protesting, according to the data of analytics apparently faked and stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razants, many Protestants were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised the Ethiopian leaders, as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty abatement.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protestants held in Gondar, an amharic city, dominated by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts agree that the protests of the US and other Western allies bring to a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used the American government as a basis for Dronenoughs to neighbouring Somalia, even if it recently agreed that it closed the base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to collapse in a volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr. Abdi, "said Mr. Abdi," is a very thin congratulations. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his assertion Obama was founded ISIS 'Sarcasus. "</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scattery the last controversy on Friday that his campaign was to scrutinize his campaign, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "Founder" of the Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions about the communication skills of the republicans of the republicans whether it is capable of communicating and comprehensible to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellowout, who make every effort to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain the peculiar position, which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the indication of a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump put back on the assertion on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really didn't intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in a morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the testimony that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, wanted to know nothing about the Republican Presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The final storm of criticism against Mr. Trump descends while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign for accident surveys on economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return again to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons of suggestions would lead to higher taxes and found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought Sarcasus to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he moved strong criticism from himself when he said that Russians should hold Mrs. Clintons of emails, but he later said "Natural," I thought the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic limits in politics and then return to rowing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans, as they arrive, and then if necessary," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is smart enough to keep his testimonies enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpest the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed a corrosive sound, because his detections are gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a large margin in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and head-in-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is trying not to excuse himself for his provocative declarations, he accused his critics to distort his sayings or falsely.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is focussed on attention in the past few months of its presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps joke his loyal participation in the uncomfortable situation to have to stand independently of how provocative may be his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocacy, there were big effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN-interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani so he was questioned by Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Clinton would have founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in that sense that before Obama had an almost unknown, small organization, he called her amnists, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream Republican try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton had served as an outsider, ISIS has allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them back on any of his words and prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the "poor, miserable" TV expert who try to understand him and said, "You can't do it!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trumps excuse only another proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidential Office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once pushed over the price of the market, cafe in Greenpoint comes back</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a ashamed café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but for 15 years good coffee served.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were displaced out of his Bedford Avenue Ladin front.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's shop, which was sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals smokes it as last loss in a gentrified city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, it is also curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accept credit cards, but has still some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafes, the owner and managing director of the new cafes.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working in Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new site, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He led new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu includes sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garages like capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer more, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a stoked power on old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices of Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the Verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after being moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way forward.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb closed, she gave her a coffee break for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I realized that it was at the coffee and on the culture in the verb which I liked," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now they drink coffee again, even if they were in this day instead of their usual iced Coffees a Blended Chai Tea, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and ordered inevitably the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and receive new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays, Rosenthal gets its usual order but sometimes he alternates his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he did not think about it, that the soap store took the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owner of the Soap Cherie has offered a special soap for use with the cold brewed coffee of the coffee as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go down on their offer," said Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional, Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has compiled the menu in Polish and Rodriguez said that he has prepared to exhibit her soon so that his new neighbours will feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice locally wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee in the bottles.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café expands on an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed in the ground, when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that the site of Lokas and the Order felt a new coffee as a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension into the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took up his lunch at Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As gourmets President Roosevelt was a Faible for refined delicacies at Fifth Avenue like Pâte de Foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering from suffering," Jane Zsealed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "There was also a message to Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" acted from Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while brick in her book "97 Orchard" talks about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity, when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snowy Imbach in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh water scrubbing with olive trees, while Coe, 57, Turkey ate with mashed and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter responded, this took the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," said Zsealed.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanuts, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a few cheap ones, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine to eat so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grinste.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women coves for male field workers and it was served fresh baked pasted for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans sent to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" is drawing up the way with which the country went with it not to be more largenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in the food for the Americans a central theme," touched Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was tense: mysterious food such as bread and casserole were added to basic food, the casserole, as a magnificent way to rejuvenate the casserene, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients among a crest sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced with cheap dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was years of focus of American cuisine, became a rarely serviced luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar compounds have been tried, as a calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority before taste or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, bricks made a court of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular additive at lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Brick continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Like never before or since then, the fiscal budget - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923-1943 - the eating habits of the country abruptly.</seg>
<seg id="33">By being published in newspapers and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encourage women to become "budget spolitives" and the challenge to transform Pampa as cremly spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historical treat.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-Cake.</seg>
<seg id="36">As he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he speives like the one-millionth man of the world to which he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked Continental Cuisine than fish with belt conce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was terrific to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would have sinned the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example of his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the invention of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours caused by Mrs Roosevelt, that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most famous prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the types from the Great Depression, to deal with food, has been rejected when the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, as well as on how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple had to better understand the eating habits of Zbrim's mother in law - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="46">When you remember, people actually got sick. "</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the result of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates had been cleared out at Eisenberg's, they removed and Coe a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum drained to lunch the President Roosevelt.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebra is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually come only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie received only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">On average, the Greenland-shark swims on the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is average just 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, it accelerates the five-metre long animal to satte 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a sturgeon.</seg>
<seg id="9">This healthy lifestyle seems to be a patch concept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" anyway from a Grönlandhai which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Schumlein is commented by Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the evolutionary biologist thought long that Grönlandhaie is stone old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures of the six degrees Celsius, they usually live on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know a little about the lifestyle of Grönlandhaie's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her zeitpentine expressed it, when they spread six animals with a transmitter in front of the Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, these sharks nevertheless found themselves: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a sturgeon, another had swallowed the jaw bones of a young kingfisher.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the iceberg and seek cadaver, which tortured from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as catcher from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502-centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, it analyzes the carbon-14 method of sharpening sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, which are not renewed in the proteins.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had taken a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the early 1960s, their birth should therefore lie in the atmosphere larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters, the linear nucleus contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the bigger Grönlandhaie in its lenticles had normal carbon-14 quantities, which arises due to cosmic ray in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, carbon-14-Clock was shown for a 493 cm long Grönlandhai one of 335 years, while the record shark should be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they're longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to rearrange the length of their length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably became the threshold for the sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland-haie with the multiplication of at least one and a half centuries period.</seg>
<seg id="32">This also might be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusureme live primarily in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, whose burning was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">The low temperatures often run the organism to the animals living there.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal heat remains.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives thus more dangerous and should focus on how many offspring as soon as possible," explains the theory of evolution.</seg>
<seg id="42">In contrast, a very big animal should rather invest its resources in long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt benefits from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">Accordingly, the City of Main Event has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies in London with Paris, Dublin and Luxemburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the Competence Market Fairs and Real Estate markets of IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain if money stores are further operated from financial transactions across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">Approval in the UK is thus far enough for the so-called EU passport.</seg>
<seg id="6">These are just great U.S. banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lobbying Association in Frankfurt am Main Finance "expects a 10000 new jobs at the Main Event in five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), is the responsibility for monetary policy and supervising over the largest banks of the Eurozone, including further important authorities, such as the European insurance supervisory authority EIOPA and risk of risk ESRB.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Paris, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) had its headquarters, but this was less significant for the financial sector than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the proximity to the staff is important for banks as it can communicate so directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the same time, Luxembourg gets a major fund for money, as well as Dublin as well as in the infrastructure near the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Due to the big airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Further points of the city with slightly available commercial real estate ads.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," Voigtländer is saying.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition to the Seine, the rent for high-class business premises are 50 percent higher than on the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Frankfurt offers higher quality of life than competition, thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of corporate consulting Mercer, the city was set up on No.7, Luxembourg to No.19 and Paris at 37th place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if the quality of life is a question of preference: "with its already strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW refuses.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Brexit vote in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is also about 144,000 people working in London according to the numbers of Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, in the banking industry, in Frankfurt, it was 62500.</seg>

<seg id="4">In order to bridge over time to the next Romantic journey of all ministers in two years, the Oberministrant round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various shrine objectives have been reviewed and they finally decided on the Episcopal town of Freiburg, where in this year the mercy-opened gate of Mercy at the Freiburger Münster was offered a special pilgrimage destination.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis made of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenrooms are on the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Pastor Stork sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and divided the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, by train to the starting point Villingen, where a Münster's beloved wife is standing and so the pilgrimage has been kicked out of Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But on the way, the Minis made on field cross, chapels or churches all again and again to sing a song from the pilgrims song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights there were parishes of local parish available.</seg>

<seg id="15">The award-served reward was a common sgrilling on the bath in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the dawn on fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it was on the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis met on the Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and steps over the doors of Mercy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schotte Callum Skinner moves home when Brite won gold for cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">From the last night's Callum Skinner's Skinner race in Velodrom in Rio, the British team defending the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy. he made the legend proud as he came home to visit a victory of New Zealand's favourites.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after they took place in March at the Train World Championships in London, despite the withdrawal of Hoys just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hindes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys reproduced a gap that tried Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man when they stayed when they saw potential in the shallots that now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy won a Olympic champion, but in the qualifying rounds a Olympic champion, but in the Standardrunden won the New Zealanders in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Round barely back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategic shift made a major part of the transformation, with the execution in a higher gear used to slow it down and allow to allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they rose on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up a Olympic champion in the final stages and conquered the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012, Kenny and Hoys were on the side that he intentionally fell on the train after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this testimony later and there was no appeal of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">There was no such a problem with such an overwhelming victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">He said, "It feels all the GB flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so badly at so many world titles that it was incredible, to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days at Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy who was born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The beware of Hoy is the same.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels somewhat lonely alone to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said, "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be beaten to knights."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medallists in the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brake Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, who won gold in London in 2012 was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first round and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition, at the Wiggins, focusing on security.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he fought against the qualification in front of the qualification, they called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">Commenting on the women's competition, which continued tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving at his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a shot at medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domination in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drums played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April is set in the midst of sex mussels and bullying animals as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees itself the first evening of the competition at Velodrom, it looks like the legendary calling for GBs, which finally reaches its peak at the perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland caused by raising the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminum melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game since the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract, and that all supply agreements will be lifted up, such as the supply of energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A grant was established for 20 years in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of ALCOA in Portland are based on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it may come to domino effects, as the melt of approximately 10 per cent of the whole generation of electricity consumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 ALCOA closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, leading the last year to a closure of the Anglesea power station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of ALCOA in Portland loses money and risked a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the facility, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the facility.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium drop with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, shared that three additional owners will be announced their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is in the majority owned by a joint venture between ALCOA and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the system continues to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt," divided the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continues to say that the Treaties should have "backup transactions," which should be in force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL goes out that the contracts in the business year 17 can contribute to the revenues," said the supply supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenue from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong dates for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL told that it had already written the value of the treaties in its annual sum amounting to $187 million in anticipation of a cancellation. "</seg>
<seg id="19">ALCOA said that the decision to book contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... the melting of power, or power supply to ensure melt" do not impacted.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010, it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force in 2010, even if it is still a statement, why it has been signed by the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn due to the bad economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of analyst at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland had some 600 MW and Tomago some 900 megawatts of electricity every year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [current market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as a generator that would not be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Banderthian Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the Managner and Mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the special edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">The brand ambassador for Estee Lauder is and running on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Bandera wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Karlovhian-similar family), which shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family, as she forgot the cover of her sister and that ends with a classic turn: they all have a surprise-party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This presents the cliché-coated plot almost every birthday episode (Seacquid told the set, "You thought that we should forget you?," with honesty of a animation on a radio station at 8 o'clock in the morning, but Kris had to participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the release of the Vogue with safety a new era of cardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls big sister Kim likes them to have hit the Vogue cover, defeated (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue is a league for himself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most complete edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a compass, rather resembles a book book as a fashion magazine, the edition draws a large number of advertising operators (According to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the ball 615 pages advertisement).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his Coverstars is eagerly awaited that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine can seep in before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, there were clearly more "celebrities, the model" as "models, the celebrities are" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-laureate and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "Transparent model" of her generation, is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons, or reality stars or young people from today who know how to get a good Snapchat video (even if everything on Jenner applies).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who can draw in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of their career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners do not like success.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history Jenners had always looked forward in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the Mistakes of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings will be back up again when the news came out with the show Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But riding on the Missmut seems to pass at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell you pictures from themselves on their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her made pictures of Cindy Crawfords daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in Time: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator entered the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successor is dominating the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, it was therefore not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather bulky.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning, the built-in memory was eight Megabytes, which would today suffice for about two selections with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" took place exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into the shops and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euros, lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they come somehow from the Stoneage of the internet-age.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone maker had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hannover as "office in the western model."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time standard: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, even if tormented slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there is a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could see that Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era in August 1996.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and handled at Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today vendors control the market, which all came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ever and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, on Samsung and Apple alone, 555 million units alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">Global sales of the devices is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This enables the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications company.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around the smartphone has now been developed a whole industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came first in early 2007, then Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the Mac-World's introduction of the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three equipment in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, easy to use via touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Apple's triumphal march began, even today the iPhone is the most important product of the corporation.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="35">She finally vanished, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now the Sagen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a self-understanding for 20 years after his invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average every German now shows 88 times a day on his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="39">"we have to learn all the smartphone even too," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens executive board for personnel.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to one of the software production trials, advertising blockages are getting around, an "Katz- and Mausspiel."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that Adblock Plus would block a blogpost in which it hurried that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook told us that its desktops would change the coding regarding his advertisements to identify them, which is part of the advertising page, to make it difficult to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blogpost, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams, that "this kind Hin-and-Her fight between the line-tempting open source community and the converters has been underway since the invention of display blockers in progress," and that it is possible that Facebook will come back with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's biggest company for social media has left in the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying billess has become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people are used worldwide; almost four times as much as 2013.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police calls for witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspect suicide by several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman slept in the dark "in an act of despair" on the road and were hit by several cars, the police concluded in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, which was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died still on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police, which, as well as any witnesses of the incident, said to be reported.</seg>
<seg id="9">An investigational procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a conflict avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">This is something that the Prosecutor must decide, "said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where a person was running in the dark on the freeway - was decided that drivers will not assume that a pedestril runs at the night on the motorway, as it was in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a policeman of the negligent killing was acquitted when she had killed a man and killed one night in August 2014 near Payerne.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has grown unconscious on the road, took the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court asked that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate change, Venus was probably habitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble by climatic research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have deposited on similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously mentioned that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdgy atmosphere, yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to lodge living and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"at the GISS Model simulation the slow revolution of Venus exposed their daily page of the Sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella, to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of the Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably resiligible, Venus -- during the course of more than billions years, were subjected to heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Your oceans dared and its water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler Wely telescope has helped astronomers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the starry uprising.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers to understand why stars are rotating at different ratios as well as in which context the rotational spaces are set up with the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through the comparisons of our results with other starches, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his old age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The corriddle of the plejade is 445 lightyears away from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this starry originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these attacking stars encounter large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the stars of stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is allied, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>

<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say 'Goodbye'," declared the 14-time All-Star Game participants of Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the League, in 2009 he won the Yankees the World Series.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature among a ten-year contract has been generating a 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the contradiction on 31 December 2017 he will serve as consultant and youth coach - at full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, he paid for a long time with performance.</seg>

<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">One awoke Athletin would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro has become known before the seventh competition day of competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle course in Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightber Adrian Obinski were well tested and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the beginning of the athletics competitions this news occur.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chen was already proven by the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide last Sunday, which is used as a masculating agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court of CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old occupies the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly, only about 0.09 seconds they missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen would have to participate in the precursor on 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen has requested the opening of the B-Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association take the matter "very seriously and demands Chen collaboration with the investigations," cited Xinhua from a message: "we will collaborate with the International Sport Court CAS and will accept the verdict."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, IOC is not responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Likewise in the night of Rio, the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa through, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said the Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is innocent, "the only declaration could be dietary supplements," said the Athletin.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report it is said to act in the forbidden substance for blood dopamine EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B trial should also be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow promptly announced with criticism of the Athletin.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifter from the chronically loaded nation cannot participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case of "Adrian Target" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively like his brother Tomasz had been tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both of them deny the intake, but both can not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, Danekowa is especially a heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The German association IAAF had banned the entire Russian team until one exception due to systematic doping for systematic doping in Kenya, and the Läufernation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sports, former clubs in China had also taken care of violent disputes between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I will say," Lacourt said in the French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also in the centre of a conflict with the Australians Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for doping betgers," said this.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datalogau: so perfide erpressen hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently attack targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey carried out by the malware-defense specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, in part some several victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were even target of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims, willingly, willingly paid by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes and attacks on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful, the potentially explosive ransom is significantly higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a scary fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski explained in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrator discovered software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only Privateers were the goal, but the change to company attacks was scary rapidly throughout the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of an victim, it searches specifically for inlong changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software will then be presented to the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the decrypt code to the files, the victims must pay money - usually in the form of dypt Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where for private users the personal photo database is on the game, there is a sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off if a ransomware is able.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business activity, in case of a case people were in danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks, whose patients could be threatened by loss of sickacut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say to the victims, don't pay, you only promote the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators due to a halt in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers from F-Secure have examined the user surface and contact the results: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You declare their sacrifices by chat how they can pay per Bitcoin, address freely accessible support websites or decode for free download files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will be saved by private people after payments of a few hundred Euro, companies need to be hard negotiate and five-digit sum to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware-blackmail the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">But more likely, it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then find further hackers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a crime and sends another way to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inmodified calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals carry spammer on the spread," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of corporate IT leaders in the Malwarebytes Survey trust to be able to defend Ransomware by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the criminals pursue new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if encryption of data is no longer a sufficient threat to successful considerations, the perpetrators rather threatens with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means damage potential depending on type of data is still a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could continue to put new goals in the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hackerconference Defcon demonstrated safety researchers as they could have received with the Internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocking heating could potentially be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the perpetrators can then block a whole production line in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the Fond, it does not work closely.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well processed and comfortable, only the cockpit-top is falling out there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even more versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage room.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a luggage boot from 453 l at high-level and 1026 l at the flipped back-back, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical as it sounds: the seat surfaces of the backbank can fold up like chin essel, and offer dust space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk is well loaded, but the charging height is 650 mm a little higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas very powerful.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should, however, do something quieter with his work.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another engine is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering is likely to be a little more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment can be found in the tested top variant "Executive" without any desires.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City emergency braking system (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the spreader assistant is part of the security systems.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warns sometimes, because he has been rated many obstacles as "heredahende objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote light supervisor works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed regulator responds to the traffic identifier and loot the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is available only for the top-equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and a HDMI socket lie under the armrest and are therefore something awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The nearly 29000 euros for the well-equipped top-diesel are OK.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, the gasoline engine will receive 20,000 Euros, diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday suitability.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleeping disturbances</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you are getting around forever, at night, one is awake hours off, in the morning, the wake-up is not getting enough to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep insomnia and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently recovering.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there may be various reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for sleeping and sleeping medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand, however, is the insomnia, so an in- and sleepy disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">To sleep through sleep, many people find themselves as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German House Association in Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">It can include organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeping disorder expression of a different disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early Awakening is common in a depression often," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example has a herniated disc, can be poorly lying, wakes up all two to three hours and catches up to pondering about everyday problems and worry, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who sleep during a month in at least three nights per week should not sleep well and by day, should go to the doctor, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look very different: it is unbeaten, tired, unbalanced, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical complaints like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, behavioural changes, cognitive Behavior or Drugs - classical sleep tablets only occur in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, in Germany there is hardly stresses that Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary bedroom medical center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why you should start sleeping on the houseman at first, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the sleep laboratory, medical professionals advise the example of snoring with respiratory failure, in case of sickness or if one does not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, explain Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">We do not have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cuddle you go to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a rhinogoggles, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are rather many adjusting screws on which one can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and stop time, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, stopping drinking alcohol at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is quite and certainly not confederally.</seg>

<seg id="3">On the facade of a grey house somebody has ugly! "sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl that will soon be demolished, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article on this "trendy district," as the real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in the last few weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, the occupying contracts on the ground floor are still rooms and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin's inner senator handle it several times for a hard approach to the police against the project, called "No-Go Zone" for police officers and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers have been evacuated, according to the police, three weeks from the official statements by the street, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown landowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved under the juggle of sympathizants and inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">At this summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, others are talking about late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a pine tree since 1999, and Jana *, which is offered here three children, are largely driven by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects they share care about increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a pine, who wished for several police protection against vandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The digging that the Berlin's inner senator and the police set up between house networks and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which is also a lower average of average in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also home networks and the native projects have long been part of the Kiev: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under great police officers in a regular road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people today who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the quarter in the past few years has become increasingly an magnets for tourists and electoral liners from all over the world: with them, residents of East-times and former home networks operate with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also makes itself noticeable in the rentals, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on the discs collected or freshly painted facades that were cast into color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as many times along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for that not all neighbours should be concerned as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: offense such as body vulnerability, according to statistics, almost exclusively against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make atomic facts, the tend to meet new buildings and newly refurbished houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who don't have been this.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars do not give it directly in the rigs no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For studying Architecin, its road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Curiosity is consciously moved to the rigaer street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important that local residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly appeared to the interpretation of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: characterless newbuildings in former building sites that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"it is ultimately concurrent dwellings, which are not interesting for many people - here are people who are not so well contaminated," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot feel violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do, if anyone does not listen to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For assignments which are sharpened beyond colour bombers, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to a pine.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who moves, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub, can complain badly about noise.</seg>

<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee camp for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogical team supports the administration of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact for all players: refugees, refugees, refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else blends.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer indicates that the honorary more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, that deuschle is, the eivable Wollmilchau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocking as rather, as rather on the variety of desired tasks, meant - meant as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">A management expert for many languages and people, linked to a longtime experience in the field of social work, is an insatient wool of wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle means.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it will go to organization, work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since about six weeks, the 31-year-old has been involved.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has reduced a 50-percent point to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle honors and full official players are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers appear in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a grave problem for some time to find apartments for connecting wings that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to teach refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is changes from the district advisory board to Commune and JobCenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time and very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration is not found in private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not work until now, be dependent on private apartments so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, generalized apartments have to be replaced as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So new containers are soon erected in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm lead, there are internship placements, training places, one-Euro jobs and helmets for refugees and migrants who need to be undressed or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>

<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would need to develop a balance feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers like sports, contacts with locals and mainly language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So, here also administer administration and honour.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are wanted in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees, that it takes their time to bridge them, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who eventually developed the feeling, he could not work in Urbach, should not work and be unprofitable but never will integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases are there however, also, says customer honestly, "people, at which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two of the most recent events in fear of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer clearly, "what more mancher is calling naive." a remnate can, but does not exclude it.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are rather sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the attacks bring them completely in demand.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So we have to look out major and volunteer on site and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">The policy is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived in Urbach where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that Urgbacher should also be able to incorporate the previous person.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
