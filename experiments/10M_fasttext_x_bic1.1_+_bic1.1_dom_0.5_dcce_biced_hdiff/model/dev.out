Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
however , there should be a conflict with the Palest@@ inians and the discussed two @-@ states solution in the encounter .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ se .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing sett@@ ling of Israel and ends up with a bad will at the peace process .
through the deal applied by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship of the two .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial issue at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress that was partially nominated to Obama in part .
the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting had turned down to the parties in Israel with regard to that time .
in an ob@@ itu@@ ary Professor , his girlfriend have shot to be shot
in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told with a somewhat c@@ atter@@ ing voice of the police , that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb is it important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; was still alive and excited . he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house , the officers took the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that I wanted to do it ; I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who had travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already scored 300 miles to the school premises , where he shot and killed an popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ mo@@ und Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Universal employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the dis@@ astro@@ us emergency call sometime .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled it .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities always try to get a picture of what Lamb motiv@@ ates .
the details that are based on the two ends of the state show details , as well what students and employees who knew it , helped us to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , said he has not a history of violence or criminal alle@@ g@@ ation .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in one of his written book in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
the two courses applied in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , the Lamb praised , said he also seemed a little upset and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
Lamb had asked the Delta State University to give a absence of absence of health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
in this year he only set up two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the Promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him to represent no guarantee for an automatic route as Assistant Professor .
Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said he could not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ber &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs Channel when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi of Arkan@@ s@@ as again .
before he was arrested , Lamb slew herself with a .@@ 38 Cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner , Meth@@ ane Johnson .
his car ran ag@@ round in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he walked to this house but Johnson was saying that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb opened his work at the University of which 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he obtained his doctorate in education in spring @-@ ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long years of friendship Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool young guy who tried to teach the guitar game a few years .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; Hair@@ ston , sitting now 40 and lived in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and P@@ ent@@ iss were there some time together .
in the call he said , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that bor@@ dered by Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police told that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard he was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb first took Pr@@ ism as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago both appeared in a summer fair .
later they played together for one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
P@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper , and sometimes convers@@ ation@@ er at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak light bar close to G@@ auti@@ er , said that he presi@@ ded to Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss Night in the night of 5th September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic qu@@ ill in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of any sign that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we stayed on the clean up and j@@ okes each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , was conducting the first @-@ term seminar program and specialised on American banks and colonial history , did Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and became the president of his Brotherhood and the Stud@@ ents Committee .
on the Delta State Campus in C@@ lev@@ eland , about 900 people took part in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ orative ceremony on Tuesday night including teachers , employees , students and members of the community .
Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the guard , while the Univers@@ it@@ tw@@ rit@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ ws .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from C@@ lev@@ eland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associates in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected so that the police finally said that Lamb had shot the emergency call , when he called Schmidt that Lamb had called Pr@@ ent@@ iss as his wife , but there was no indication of that they ever had married .

Michael J. Fox sh@@ ards on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was notable also for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre at the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me and it will become clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to me in the sense that I am a sim@@ ulated g@@ aps and a length of it away , with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .

back @-@ Time &quot; will be shown on V@@ OD , DVD and selected movie theat@@ res in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
once again , the UN leader calls for all parties , including the UN Security Council to unite and join integ@@ rative negoti@@ ation to find a political solution .
B@@ an has said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , at the edge of the meeting of the general meeting in Syria , in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the abst@@ en@@ tions within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
B@@ an ordered the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity for the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated to the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Re@@ fra@@ y values they show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him a joke .
and some are waiting for a breakdown .
but any@@ how , as some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump to the upper ranks of the pol@@ ls in the pol@@ ls , it still does not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate .
of course it is still too early in the electoral period .
nobody said that Tr@@ ump will probably win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was submitted to the rising Herman Cain , one of whom there was only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ ward groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ ses Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now know Tr@@ ump t@@ ens@@ ile strength and start to drain her dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current environment values indicated that the property Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps popularity characteristics have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw real estate ads .
it was 40 percent by mid @-@ July .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa concluded that 60 percent of Republi@@ can have a good view of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ tors GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump is nominated .
only two of them say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son produces about the same enthusiasm as a tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who would say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they are &quot; uns@@ at@@ is@@ fied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ized for his bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ulting say@@ ings , 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans of rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that Real Estate Mog@@ ul says the right temper@@ ament for president , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ate state of nation , state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his post , and almost six of 10 Un@@ dependent say that its temper@@ ament does not adapt the white house , so ABC / post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their money , rep@@ ubli@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump for real .
when asked someone who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet on CNN / OR@@ C last week .
that &apos;s a change since the time when four out of ten had replaced their money to Je@@ b Bush .
full disclos@@ ure : GO@@ P voters had not had the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ine in the past .
at that time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry won the nom@@ ination with just 28 % for the final candidates of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , it shows that a multitude of GO@@ P @-@ voters have seen a m@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even when Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump happens almost every one .
some experts indicate that the spl@@ itter@@ ing field is likely to lead to Tr@@ umps &apos;s lead , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September demonstrates that in a pres@@ umed head @-@ in head between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump should support the majority of support .
he ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Walker Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would win the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a pres@@ umed head @-@ in head race .
a vast majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they formed their mind .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters can support Tr@@ ump , say that they have set up their voices .
of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to other candidates .
however , Tr@@ ump is the most powerful competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the Neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters say that they have formed their mind , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign two months ago , Donald Tr@@ ump , who called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; war , was the Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ s of the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that bom@@ b@@ astic pres@@ ume of Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive H@@ isp@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the new orient@@ able efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration li@@ lies in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it seems to do Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s on new high@@ lands .
meanwhile , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters , above all , fell by their out@@ si@@ ders .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post they want to go on a political under@@ side than anyone with government experiences .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa : two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the Republi@@ can are fru@@ str@@ ated with 54 percent , &quot; and 21 percent mortality was disp@@ le@@ ased . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the hobby ken@@ way there is the most expensive residential community - with view over the North Sea .
on the road , one square meter of an apartment house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which special position a square metre square costs .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really a little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top housing sites , however , the price does not occur as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service Angel &amp; Völ@@ kers publishes a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ ering in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , well @-@ indicated .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not on top here .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two teams in two parts in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy showing by Thomas Müller p@@ aving the way to FC Bayern celebrated the way to a conden@@ sed 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran &apos;s .
a so@@ vereign kick @-@ off of the Champions @-@ League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze presented a dream start to FC Bayern in the Wit@@ ch@@ es@@ sel of Piraeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League during the Champions League Cup winner thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9. ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th star success in series should be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich .
at its 28 hits in the Champions League to the Champions League received by Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who had to pass one as the flan@@ k shot shot of the World Champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate this , &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame before the game was promised at the Car@@ cass@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium on 31.@@ 6@@ 88 eag@@ erly a@@ waited fans - and the Munich @-@ held word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without shining .
Pi@@ re@@ aus has won his recent six home games in the top class , including the famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 we moved to Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria was un@@ defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek team , but did not want to be the next victims .
they went brave , however , in their aggressive efforts , but often to unic@@ or@@ essly to works .
the attacks were often accompanied by playing the left side of Douglas Costa , who suffered very rarely against the previous Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
he had more luck from the right side than his f@@ lange from the right hemisph@@ ere in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champions gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
at first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye brown hit the head ball in Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee is par@@ ked up ( 3@@ 5. ) .
even though the Bav@@ arians cat@@ ered into their usual play , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to touch her needle .
however , in Tor@@ por@@ ter Manuel Neuer was a reduction .
in this way , when he drew a shot of the cre@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola defend a four @-@ party square with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , was sitting outside .
the World Cup @-@ hero after the final training was given the green light , sport@@ swear Matthias Sam@@ mer said to &quot; Sky , &quot; &quot; who wants to make something else that is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller continues one .
in front of the game , it was all the way to get to Kra@@ w@@ all in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly du@@ ped Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block , the followers of hosts were prov@@ oked pir@@ ate with words and gest@@ ures , seized by the security forces and went with demol@@ ition to the Munich trailer .
at least one Bayern fans were injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - that puts a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
the good news : with zi@@ cht , the risk sin@@ ks rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking smo@@ kers the risk of losing their teeth is pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly to 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay , cav@@ ities and inflammation of the gum disease , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the link between smoking and loss of tooth drops should therefore return on frequent g@@ ing@@ iv@@ ing@@ itis in smo@@ kers .
not clari@@ fied , while smoking is also increased risk of c@@ aries .
the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; are expected to reduce their risk with smoking during a short period of time .
it can , however , take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again on the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , Thomas Dietrich from the English University Birmingham .
man must persu@@ ade people to be a non @-@ smoking , stated leader of H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and j@@ ars and leads to our knowledge to a good dental health until high age .
over 20 per cent of the population is affected by denti@@ stry in Germany aged 65 to 74 years , sharing the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth out@@ age .
the new long @-@ term study support the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the remains of the late period

the museum director Marcus Trier will be excav@@ ated near the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard Museum and remains of historical buildings , said the museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction on the Rhine , histor@@ ians are searching for the known floor valleys .

EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over TTIP
the European Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration awards regarding the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement to TTIP .
accordingly , the controversial private switching equipment for disputes between the corpor@@ ations and states should therefore be replaced with a transparent system which corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes in its function .
&quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizen , &quot; explained the responsible European commission@@ er Cecilia Malm@@ ström .
the Swe@@ de has to introduce the European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
by TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone should result in 800 million people .
the plans to reform current arbit@@ ration proceedings be seen , that EU states and US jointly opted as independent judges for a new Investment Court .
they should come to the same parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
the first instance is also en@@ vision@@ ed for the first time .
it would allow it to rise up against ur@@ anium .
so far , the proce@@ eding among each other to be refer@@ ee , a bar@@ gain against their judgments , did not exist .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice do not trust to Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , she plans to work on an international investment court .
there may be disputes between the Chinese companies and the EU states , for example .
the Investor @-@ Sta@@ ats @-@ Schie@@ fer for@@ ging ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional refer@@ end@@ ums are critic@@ ized by opponents as a kind of parall@@ els by emplo@@ ying a claim of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in initial statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act contra@@ cted the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate .
the criticism was critic@@ ized that they would not apply to the free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the plans were described as great progress by the German economic @-@ state Matthias Mach@@ in@@ nig ( SPD ) .
in the spring , the Commission account for essential points that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs has been drawn up in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private ump@@ ing dishes is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Forum in Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned not to limit the economic opportunities for the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it also named it .
when convers@@ ations over the TTIP free trade agreements TTIP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will be completed on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
at the end of this year , a frame should be at the end of this year .
this date is not applicable to any longer .

he tells of various places he shows again on the map , what about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ated and tender songs .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gments
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s quest@@ ionnaire was anticipated .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n said his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ pp@@ ies and David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of its six prescribed questions briefly after lunch , where his power is prob@@ able by the media and by the Labour Party by the proximity .
he called for &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions , to respond to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the K@@ att@@ enk@@ an@@ inet@@ ts and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile the decision of the Labour leader began to ins@@ ist on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cr@@ iti@@ que by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the center of multiple cover pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that he had stood in respec@@ t@@ ful silence . &quot; he acknowledged the Royal Air Force fire fighting in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy was to be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve with Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top staff , and they are appointed to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ sixth of the parliamentary party provided him as leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also ranks within Labour &quot; and to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n comments on the European Union and the Lim@@ itation in winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour Chan@@ ges make changes to remove all the idea of a total limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work and pen@@ sions minister , said that the party &quot; was very clear &quot; that it was just against the government plans , to cut the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 2@@ 3,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron since he is head of T@@ ory , over the last decade over the D@@ isp@@ atch @-@ Box in the parliament .
the Labour leader who has promised another polit@@ ician , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the argument of the Prime Minister is too confron@@ ting , and that it is under@@ going to under@@ mine both &quot; Schlag@@ fer@@ ti@@ bles , &quot; and the Stre@@ ets with contra@@ dictions , and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy is represented by it , if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also brought the idea that other colleagues would sometimes take the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem .
in 2005 , when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove himself from politics in style of a &quot; cas@@ le Theatre &quot; that often deals with the Prime Minister &apos;s fac@@ tions . however , a few years later he acknowledged that he was f@@ ailing in it .
as it was broadcast first on television in 1990 , the coun@@ ten@@ ance with the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the decision of one leader and his position in the House and his position under his parliamentary report , although critics have argu@@ ed that they become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far reaching reforms .

pound goes through accelerated wage increase in the UK
the pound was weigh@@ ted after data that displays an increase in the increase in wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the building target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result of without bonuses in the UK grew by 2,9 % compared with the same period prior to the same period last year .
this percentage was the fastest and earned inc@@ enti@@ als at the time of interest in interest .
the pound was climbed by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 505 and climbed by 0.@@ 84 % to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover offer of the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and produce brands such as Bud@@ ì@@ j@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were based on encouraging con@@ uts for luxury goods by 0,@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts newest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - growth again .
the company of G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E climbed 5 % after the mining company said that he took 2.5 billion dollars by a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the stocks of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , namely a 4.3 % drop , since Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had made his assessment for the rating company Rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after having reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million for the first half year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports states that higher wages may end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more buying power in pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this buying power will be equal to higher labor costs at his company , says he .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , added , and this could mean that there is less additional jobs .

P@@ EG@@ IDA - Lebanese tri@@ mming on potato woo@@ fers
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it works both - and in the potato woo@@ fers , which the Ol@@ den@@ berg I@@ mb@@ ab@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed .
inspired by the prover@@ b &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a p@@ eg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat spread to a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster with a Peg@@ ida demonstration with &quot; Pot@@ atoes &quot; instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he acci@@ dentally seen on television .
since then in his shop , a grill column , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multi@@ ble@@ ach for the stomach , &quot; Al@@ h@@ ay said .
Lebanese man has meanwhile brought the idea to the Patent Office in Munich .
so , according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility models .
therefore , how much meat and how much potatoes will have the sk@@ e@@ wer , I don &apos;t want to betra@@ y Al@@ h@@ ay .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds himself .
the culinary understanding also begins at its customers .
Met@@ cash starts bottom line campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ jection
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A @-@ branch before an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale dealers Met@@ cash have launched an under@@ standings in order to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , &quot; Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing concerning the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A tra@@ der and supplier jump on board with brands such as Eis@@ manufacturers Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , which is distributed in IG@@ A - stores and shop owner who sell supplies for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash announces further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers negoti@@ ate for food , alcohol and devices its annual investors strategy day .
it is a lot on the game since South Australia and Western Australia can make almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs IG@@ A stores , and higher profit margin as a Met@@ cas@@ see IG@@ A network in eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A @-@ retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di &apos;s twelve months after opening his first markets will buck@@ le around five percent of the food market in these two states , and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent individual distribut@@ ors .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stanley estimates that IG@@ A @-@ reta@@ iler could lose $ 360 million in revenue per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pre@@ diction is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , generating a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and grocery store and the amounts of Met@@ cas@@ a high fixed cost base could cost around $ 13 million in pre @-@ tax profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market share is lost in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan had found out that IG@@ A @-@ buyers are the faithful ones .
Morgan Stanley is cla@@ iming that met@@ cas@@ ees gain sales in food and grocery market by 3.8 percent in 2017 , by 4.9 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and its market share will drop to 10.4 percent in 2015 to 10.1 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash was refused to respond to Mr Dou@@ glass by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has taken contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ ees Food and food trade , which has approximately 1,200 IG@@ A retailers worldwide , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , refle@@ cting its operative debt reduction on turnover and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers fights and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ in order to increase sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ dt at hundreds of products each week and IG@@ A @-@ retailers in improving their stores due to faster growing fresh foods and supplying a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ cade CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjust@@ ments and loading programmes can be awarded to Elan for the first time in four years to return to earnings .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is Heal@@ y supported by the President of the Australian tennis player Steve Heal@@ y
Tan@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behavior .
Tan@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the shorter storm for his friend Nick Cy@@ ril and deserves praise as criticism of the President of the Australian tennis player Steve Heal@@ y &apos;s criticism as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , which is always described as &quot; special KS &quot; by the not@@ orious engagement of Cy@@ ril with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying play in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison have to be separated by the arbit@@ rator , taking called Harrison , and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
while he was last seen a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp th@@ wart@@ ed a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of Heal@@ y was defended .
the teen star is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for finishing second in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final against Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I &apos;m getting around , is the fact that after my opinion , Than@@ asi was drawn a little in the dispute , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
he has broken a ra@@ cket , when he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration by himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserve a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he is never aired in the changing area , he is well trained and he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
Heal@@ y also did not take the decision to take into account the important decision which starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as long @-@ term stability into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick made very quick to the ascent , what people like Feder@@ er and Murray have made it to support him , but we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his work , but in which he can only think about it , I think it is best for the team and it is best for him and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Emer@@ gency , close the border , with@@ holds refugees
Hungary explains the emergency and ri@@ pped the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and fulfilled all that they tried illeg@@ ally to come into the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of immigrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence that had fled for an unknown time in a land strip on the street between the two points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose up .
when a police helicopter above them flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried with ins@@ ults against Hungarian emergency police .
some were driven by protest gro@@ c@@ eries and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants were sent back from Hungary , more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tur@@ bul@@ lying on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels cannot agree on common immigration policy .
the Minister agreed to share the responsibility for 40.000 people who were in the shr@@ ink of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would have reached another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit on Tuesday in order to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary didn &apos;t put his hopes on a verbal action of Brussels or his neighbours .
the emergency exit in two south regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they were able to block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having taken a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates in the race to build the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary became for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a considerable lack of entry into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban passed on , however , that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees , which are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force around midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaged 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns who built the government on the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impos@@ e higher prison sentences for convicted traff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; owing to the situation that originated by the mass members , the Hungarian government states the emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orter of Associ@@ ated Press currently have seen the armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities arrested 45 people while trying to cross the border , 15 others had already entered into the country .
they come across by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences by the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials took up two of the seven border cros@@ sings to Serbia on Tuesday after a train @-@ car with bar@@ bed wire to close the fron@@ ti@@ ers .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push down there .
about 20 succeeded to get there but thousands stayed outside .
a further group of migrants blocked the principal highway alliance of Serbia and Hungary , and said they would refuse food and water until they may arrive to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
former U.S. Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continued to stop a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at the national level but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins on the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voting for the local elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den who has not announced yet whether he is entitled to the Presi@@ dential Office , receives support for 15 percent of the parliamentary elections of the parliamentary elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons Supp@@ orters are more resistant than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News pol@@ l , Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profit .
Clinton holds a big advantage in both women and moder@@ ates , but these projec@@ tions have reduced .
your support for the men has fallen sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points behind .
clin@@ ically the benefit of democratic voters under the age of 50 has succ@@ um@@ bed , and they are different now on the same height .
however , Clinton had a big advantage over the older voters .
in the past month , Clinton was before S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the Presi@@ dential elections of the local elections say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and a further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons of the current supporters are especially thrilled by her .
the views are stronger bl@@ ended with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just about one quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of the parliamentary elections say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters about Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ tons Supp@@ orters are asked in an open question , it is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman &apos;s President is ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
also , by Clin@@ tons Supp@@ orters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned .
consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ tor@@ iness will also be cited .
as the Vice President casts a potential for the presidential office of the orph@@ ans , 57 per cent of the democratic voting shall be able to see him in the race - although one @-@ third does not believe he should not do it .
if a democratic electoral model is asked , who would be the second choice for the Party , Bi@@ den is on top .
by clin@@ chers , more than half they say that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far ahead of them .
choose Bi@@ den , not to deal with the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ cr@@ ates , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s margin increases in front of S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate in the best odds to win election ; however , this figure declined by 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measuring , but the percentage that regards him as the &quot; sel@@ f@@ rank &quot; has risen .
however , if the question arises , what is more important for an employee , Democratic Cho@@ irs call questions about the v@@ oter .
similarly as in the last month , no single demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ ent candidate or potential candidate for voters turn out to be un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic Candi@@ dates and potential candidates take good results with some important features in voters of their party &apos;s pres@@ ets .
we look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons is the leader .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about him .
the local voters do generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voting has no opinion of S@@ anders .
there &apos;s questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an exchange office , most of the che@@ ers of voters are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinion has not influenced overall .
but there is a totally different story in the American public .
half of Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with its declaration , while only a third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on the general opinions of Clinton , even though 36 percent said they had even worse their opinion .
mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views from Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of their party as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights do not keep them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the country &apos;s eligible budget will also see Tr@@ ump as non @-@ honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good music on the lead .
Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush of the six tested candidates cut the best from hon@@ esty .
a majority does not see S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but like with Car@@ son many have no opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 che@@ ap@@ ers at the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to national further survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is being den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
according to the two candidates , half the support of voters in the new survey will now fall dramatically .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters support nation@@ wide further Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support increases by 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l , which was carried out by Fox News debate in the past month , 27 % in the survey carried out on Tuesday .
but car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son cons@@ ulted in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passed tr@@ ump with rep@@ ubli@@ can voters with higher levels .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Kas@@ ich , is dealt with Wis@@ con@@ sins , Governor Scott Walker , who fell in the deepest in the last month , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the pol@@ ls - he ends at 19 % support with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a view to one in the last week Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side down for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask b@@ umps regarding faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing @-@ temperatures : the eastern part of the Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if the peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find hot water .
a swim in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some are not going into the sea anymore : the maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
Bad@@ aling temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the East it even gets up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the Adriatic , and in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
for almost two years , having a student while a student link in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , mur@@ ders are filed against five persons .
members of New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood accessed Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed their transport into the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with sand with a 30 pound pack of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field on a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g was finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the call number 911 after Den@@ g f@@ ainted and wait for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to goo@@ gling his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to bring advice , said pol@@ ka Chris Wagner met in a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide goods and put the welfare of the Brotherhood basically over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ v@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
according to a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with st@@ ump@@ y power injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh .

this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
a turn of interest comes , and the Hou@@ ses will come into che@@ ek , which will advance to bonds , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
which we do not know how long this will take and how long it will stop .
the history of the economy offers only low guidance for the economy .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
the Federal Reserve of the Federal Reserve of the Federal Reserve of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor of how the economy and financial investments are respon@@ ding .
hence representatives of the US central bank acc@@ entu@@ ate so much that investors should not focus on knowing when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather at the time required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could determine that the whole excitement was ag@@ ger@@ ated due to a rate of interest .
&quot; the first raise of the F@@ ed ever since the global financial crisis is being interpreted in@@ correctly by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at the Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal tre@@ ads , but still rising to low level in order to se@@ duce a se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to be afraid .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historic trends that could react to some areas of the economy :
as the market has seen in the last month , the sale of an@@ cover@@ ings may make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l .
once the increase is entering , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to di@@ ced assets for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a more recent study , what had happened after canc@@ els of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually down@@ ward in the last 35 years - roughly 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , quite flat in the 250 days after an average profit after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 per cent , with an average profit in the last six years , with an average profit margin in Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks could be encounter@@ ed later in the raising cycle , and the margin begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but an@@ cover@@ ies often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and accelerate the recession .
what is remarkable is that the Gross Domestic Product will be at the proximity of its lowest point at a credit card of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 r@@ ann@@ als had only twice the nominal GDP at 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only few expected that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
tri@@ c cav@@ ities in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and disc@@ ard the question , &quot; whether it &apos;s different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
the market participants have made the whole year on a number of interest made , and all eyes were fixed on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many shr@@ ines and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading will only involve an increase of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all the increases cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle of increasing GDP and on @-@ rec@@ essions , very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is far from the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are up to 74 months .
the fixed in@@ comes was also vol@@ at@@ ile because the market assumes a interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
when bor@@ row , the margin seem to change the direction once the first increase / reduce in the cycle .
at the end of the increases cycle the bond results fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strings of Charles Schw@@ ab do believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to the margin of length@@ ier and shorter bonds and lead to a curve of the curve .
highly en@@ trin@@ sic bonds often bring better yields , even though we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting is that Jones thinks that markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is flat , lending trends , and the vol@@ at@@ ility has increased - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed spur@@ ts its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies who handle the larger part of their business activities in the USA will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are becoming more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts will be worse , as a rising dollar represents its products in the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet companies sur@@ passed companies with weak balance after each of the interest rate since 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ratio as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
beyond the pure shares , consumers will also profit from the rising cost .
savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts differ in different opinions such as fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM broadcast , says Andrew B@@ ingham
the Parliament of Parliament critic@@ ized the broad@@ c@@ aster because of its &quot; stupid &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly unlikely to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , and said that she was im@@ it@@ ating only The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ Colle@@ ge Dam@@ ien Collins were sending The Voice to The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 is changing &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary committee and raises new pressure on the sender , to prove that he does something that does not do the private transmitter .
con@@ serv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham said that the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen also said that the public @-@ legal radio station should be &quot; stupid &quot; and increasingly not to disc@@ ern from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he was also target@@ ing the BBC Music Awards , launched last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ CEO gave up the draft and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors if it concerns live music and clari@@ fication of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music nowhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works on behalf , I also really think for it , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller was argu@@ ing that harder to work to do the audience than it did in the past , because the British were informed about classical music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production during the hearing in the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and is not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was in@@ sist@@ ing that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge , &quot; was produced in particular BBC @-@ mode . &quot;
he added that his company had &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; if it st@@ alls the next time a entertainment range .
however , he ref@@ uses to exclu@@ de the order of other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money from the ge@@ es@@ ge@@ t@@ ler for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose the slow@@ down in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to go shopping
experts believe that black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the expenses
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets become transformed into ghost towns .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online sales stag@@ n@@ ated after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ated after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and proceed until 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G @-@ sale de@@ xes the Guardian .
he stated that online sales grew more than three years ago , as a buyer , started making purchases with their cell@@ phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e. g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes oneself , and we may experience the growth of growth .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for premium sales .
experts believe that buyers will take their purchases on this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers will be on their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some distribut@@ ors crashed .
experts believe Black Friday in which the buyer could fight against bar@@ gains , buyers that could keep purchases of them .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found out that a £ 5 output had been issued slightly more than 1 £ .
with some products such as TV and laundry , more than one @-@ third of the purchases will now be done via web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes , rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane @-@ accident killed - bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried in Mec@@ ca because of the first bur@@ ial conditions in Mec@@ ca .
Saudi Arabia det@@ aches the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group .
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane over@@ threw the crane
hundreds of Muslims assembled themselves when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the buried , when a crane over@@ threw the large crane on Mek@@ cas .
arch@@ ing filled , largely immersed in white , the course to get their respect for lost when the first of the dead emerged their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ ets@@ m cemetery .
the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession passed by the Holy Place where only days before , a building crane passing through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the praying .
the bodies were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi King sat over the building company of the Bin Laden , because of the disaster that also had 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction hung .
the bodies of 29 people , who were killed as a crane over@@ threw the Great Central of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram consisted of Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who had jour@@ ne@@ yed on his first pilgrimage being the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram worked with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi Arabia already pointed out that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the Crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the governmental Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English language service agency informed that detail , however , said that the leader of the company abroad must be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man suffered to reveal what was caused by the overthrow of the wre@@ ath , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were taking place in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group issued no statements on the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ en@@ ret has also en@@ forced the Group for non @-@ current security measures , and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .

the Bin Laden family has been connected with Saudi Arabia as a host family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a gra@@ ce@@ ful son who was dispos@@ ed of by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once a day of everyday life .
officials said that 158 people were in hospital .
rules are appointed to pay 1 million R@@ ial ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the killed and the same sum of permanently injured .
other injured are given half of this amount .
B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap East European art@@ is@@ ans is over
British concern increasingly craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has a rise
this enables 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ ast shops , which aim to set up on tra@@ des@@ people

it is claimed that British performing its hamm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualifying East European art@@ is@@ ans that carry out the work in their home
if you are sent to paint with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you may seem to be a minority nowadays .
because Brit@@ ons increasingly operate craftsmen in order to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the Company &apos;s head behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ markets chain , said that a large rise in number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , which offer services to deep prices .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ ast shops , which will set up to tra@@ des@@ men and 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten buying decisions in the shop are met by women .
at the moment the men weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single homes , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to post@@ p@@ one this into a balance .
in principle half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed on the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 , has also gained their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies 50 percent of the teams with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; This was a conscious decision - it is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher was reported a decline in half @-@ year profits and sales after the Group &apos;s costs involved in stores of stores .
for the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .

he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants were cryst@@ all@@ ised in the years 2006 to 2011 , contribut@@ ing to United Nations , about which they used to disp@@ ose of their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is handled with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also indicted for financial reasons .
this fact was divided between the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence stip@@ ulated that the association would not have appeared at any time .
the sports officials could only have been compens@@ ated for compensation and the sports club , which they had invested in between 1982 and 2011 , where they invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va was in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euros ) .
&quot; back then we stood in front of the situation : do we continue fighting the club or block us ? , &quot; he told , one of the accused , on bread measuring on bread .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless agreed with the association , you can freely manage the money , there is only no debts to be made .
generally speaking - with the financial and financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance was retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore , one section of the allowance was only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been in the account , paid out .
therefore , flat @-@ up and not detailed shut@@ down , the former Ob@@ mann also explained the proceedings .
the accounts and accounts ruled the two accused , including the accused .
why the out@@ flow of the club had not been laid out in detail , the judge asked .
the society don &apos;t care in detail for financial bor@@ rowing , it was important to have the freedom of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 had been referred to the United Kingdom &apos;s account against one of the official investigations .
these were their reserves , the accused declared .
that securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; wanted to know the judge .
then the in@@ quired did not answer for a long time .
then he said finally , he believed that this was the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything about that money , the prosec@@ utor in the room .
the def@@ endant was informed , but just@@ ifying the function@@ ary .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; Dam@@ age repar@@ ation . &quot;
why poll@@ ut@@ ants ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ endant said that he would not have agreed with this phr@@ ase because the club was never caused any damage .
but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; All of you are all from the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; is I an legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
he said that the functional man had never covered a cent salary , but he only offset o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
he had to charge € 1,000 per month to di@@ ets , but the real expense was much higher than he added .
exact documents for the early years could not prove the def@@ endants .
these be , according to an audit , in which everything has been judged correctly , they declared not to be kept .
mil@@ eage had also covered the second accused .
all of the co@@ g@@ ations can be made in cash , so he has to leave from his home market to the Bank to lead , and explained in his testimony .
the trial will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ database
the world witnessed when the U.S. emergency database comes to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade will be raised or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists that were question@@ ed by Reuters has found that a little more than half of the fact that the F@@ ed should do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and keep the interest rates on its current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it &apos;s a historical event , because it &apos;s been seven years since the F@@ ed set interest to NULL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank might leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Head of Directors at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy depends on a relatively good performance , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and only generate a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed can &apos;t ignore the less rough view of global circumstances .
it war@@ ns the markets , to increase in an increase , but signs indicate that chances of such a step are good .
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
deaths at the Delta State University failed to write ap@@ olog@@ ation
following the shot and killing of his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning and killing it , Sh@@ annon Lamb said a note to tell him , &quot; he couldn &apos;t do it , &quot; said he could in@@ let it happen . &quot;
the Police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he was shot on someone , and one killed him .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency talk , that the police reports the police to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call upon his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I didn &apos;t want to und@@ o it .
I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after the note &apos;s letter , Lamb leads 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he took E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him .
Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said he could not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ber &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite the reports on Monday that Lamb thought I thought that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relation . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was discovered by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who told her about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en he said he and Pr@@ un@@ iss had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss &apos; her daughter was &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning that was first encounter@@ ed with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
the police told Lamb that I called relatives to a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot;
when police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb leads his car to the side , he fled , ran into the forest , killing himself with a shot .
he obtained a doctorate from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his Life Coun@@ sel@@ or at the University &apos;s website .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double correction
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double correction of his right B@@ one in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven .
as this brought down the left defense to tears , and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of play , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury has been caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had moved in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playground and needed equipment before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double b@@ ale structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then went to Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen massage .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double correction , it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of a rest .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , hasn &apos;t punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbit@@ rator has v@@ ast@@ ly mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery now begins , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK @-@ Defender has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover until the coming of June .
Phillip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves out of this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to off@@ end a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg cur@@ ry when Mexiko against Van Ga@@ as the Holland team at the World Cup 2014 played .
&quot; it &apos;s very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and when you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball going on in another direction , so it looked like he did not see &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
Mor@@ eno said in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a oul@@ dering of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know better David Cameron ?
it is one thing that will learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
as he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was asked to refer to the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which appeared in 1971 of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company super camps , and continues , &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to have missed an image or message we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , returns a sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis of the movie version of 2012 which added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ an @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , has filled with her desire to meet a real tree , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss host@@ els , and who died in 1991 , is completely unknown .
as if that was not the susp@@ ect enough : the text produced by Cameron is partly descri@@ bing how the Sum@@ mary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is artificial on the website of Internet Movie Database , where all is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the book of the book so much . here , an un@@ named young guy , like the local environment , appears to be for@@ ce@@ ful , swe@@ eping scul@@ p@@ tive beings , &quot; which is speaking in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax had not read 20 times in a row with a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson simply said that the text had probably come from the Camera dealer &apos;s office .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally threatened by the England squ@@ ad , but it is still hard
to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if one does not see the Ka@@ der who has chosen the UK for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test @-@ series does not fall on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ wards victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks Page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ling list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not bear any sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test layer , is an option for the attack .
this is related to this : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision , Adam Ly@@ th , is of course difficult to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire .
at his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality that cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ters are aimed at results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - player to choose their own best selection .
a long time ago , one would have extended the race of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he break out more runs for Yorkshire , another chance comes .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not take such good performances , and that surprises me not ; it is above all a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a Test Par@@ man gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th won seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on got nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that you can collect when England left Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in maximum shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a r@@ ammer , whom I guess .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket @-@ player , which we saw Yorkshire earlier in this season when he achieved 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very well .
he must have received at least the same odds as those before him , but this depends upon the team order in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of showing Mo@@ een next to Cook , who would get a guest @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and di@@ pped four Qu@@ icks , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why an impact man can &apos;t beat out there , and this left handed has already shown that it is a v@@ ector of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques had not performed his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is a number 3 for them , and there is no difference there .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as an open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred p@@ endants immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited interaction with him he has impressed me very much as a young man .
people possibly see his statistics on - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there &apos;s no big number of backup sp@@ inn@@ s that collect their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England made some very wise additions at the coaches .
the nom@@ ination of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master tape .
he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ion of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played all the conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and how Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously requested .
Col@@ l@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used at One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar pause against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but coaches and te@@ amm@@ ers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light in heart .
the Bre@@ xit Camp ( Bre@@ xit = Aus@@ gling Britain from the EU ) could gain extra impact on the economy by 2017 , when the economy is running into a dol@@ drums .

actually , Tony Bl@@ air didn &apos;t think about it , but he pointed out that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one is better ban@@ ked to di@@ stract him instead of finishing his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ air himself as Bl@@ air himself , when he had refused the referendum as a member of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .

it is correct , Cameron does not give free ticket for Europe allowing to hold al@@ ours assistance in the refer@@ end@@ setting campaign for a deduc@@ ting , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think so for sure .

as with its am@@ big@@ uous activities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to the outlet , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in particular a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin get political capital - they have also mis@@ led v@@ oter - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be po@@ int@@ less ?
the U.S. have already been very disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was re@@ minded on Monday by something of the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public Health Britain report about e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes have less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ izing the method used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
yet , some researchers have question@@ ed the power rating of the data and referred to the links between several experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial on the Lanc@@ et medical journal launched the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily clear foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion on the P@@ he .
two more researchers have been writing in BM@@ J and were asked whether to build upon the cont@@ en@@ ings &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said , &quot; The basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on efficacy of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the alle@@ g@@ ation expected that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking , based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ critical criteria ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their views on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine hal@@ ign products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously named by British American Tob@@ acco Drugs ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T on public health in a sustainability report , and they said .
one of the 12 participants stated on the meeting was to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the financing that he report@@ edly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International they added .
the reasons for choosing the members of the body are not delivered but include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes Champions , of which also indicate a sector finance in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco line of P@@ he participated in the session as well .
the group &quot; research work is characteristic , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most of the products , &quot; attributed to Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however no such connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence so far there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have been as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking people . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well@@ being at P@@ he , said that on the statement from BM@@ J was already re@@ acted before .
he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all the evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are minor , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence is occupied and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative danger compared to tobacco .
nearly 80.000 people die each year on a disease with respect to smoking and smoking costs two billion £ per year .
the clear provision of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes is not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up to East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio management should only be used to make the type of programs broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ized the BBC for making them public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ str@@ ating time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from actors like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are in order or sends it clearly out of un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications Committee under its investigation into the BBC &apos;s future .
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I keep medium or long term not for a good idea , you should at least give up his production on programs that do not make or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to reach a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is non@@ sense of course .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs will be financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another one , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
I am trying to see how this should be public TV .
I do not think this would reduce the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC &apos;s complic@@ ity in search of reviews was &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular Shows the BBC i@@ fies that the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture took place in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders should sell .
Johnson had said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ative programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they could not measure their tasks , but they can argue that they have created all those obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a window of time , in which no one ever wanted to see them .
to the radio fee , Johnson said to the board : &quot; I need to find a reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions which can get the best value here .
of course you think all that you get for 150 £ each year here a great value , but for people who is £ 150 a lot of money , ask me whether this is right , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , urged to check that the BBC had to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to make and maintain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said only little from BBC production now - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should change to the publicly @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful can be shown on TV , and to make alli@@ ances available online in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ cytes can change the direction in which it radi@@ ates with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems , controlled by injec@@ tors of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des alter the direction in which she with sound impul@@ ses , which have too high frequencies for human hearing , are exposed to em@@ itted .
the impul@@ ses work by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , gene@@ tically modified to wear the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels , which react on ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics which can be used ultrasound in order to activate a range of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ en@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an inv@@ as@@ ment procedure which returns electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
flat@@ worms are usually not acting on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani pointed out that they did , when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which penet@@ rate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves result in the opening of these ion@@ ic channels and activate cells that they are assigned , such a Review Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions can apply to TR@@ P @-@ 4 icons .
when he turns to the changed creatures on the changed creatures , the sound waves are intensi@@ fied and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions .
the process has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ asters , a pione@@ ering tool that enables scientists to activate neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Khal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be lowered at an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound tissues might happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical attitude for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; Hal@@ as@@ ani said .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student residence
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence for 19 years , but still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral relev@@ ance , but only now I recall the cl@@ amped sm@@ iles that I have stum@@ bled - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residence is sufficient to fri@@ ghtening up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to wat@@ ering : people tell whence you get , from where you get Sab@@ batt@@ ens where you are standing in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you have said &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a He@@ fe@@ as@@ kt ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through . breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you wouldn &apos;t talk about even if your eyelashes would burn fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film night venue and communal hits , but they are also dressed in places where people put on and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t forget to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough handling at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student houses build a room @-@ to @-@ room b@@ um@@ mel culture that can lead to a friendly and social and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want to go on our friendship but you have to go away so I get the energy back I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a compass is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send SMS instead of t@@ apping .
ap@@ rop@@ os pine@@ apple : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw several things .
the friendship binds through baking .
since you start the university at the height of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the knock at the doors of humans to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel committed to enter@@ tain themselves and will perhaps associate your face with a lovely surprise at the end .
of course , it depends on whether you are a decent bak@@ ers .
badly missing cl@@ umps made of flour , sugar and fat make sure people get sleeping . if you knock out .
to steal food is a perpet@@ ual crime in student residence .
naturally , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check it out with the dairy owners .
chances are good that they say to control yourself , even when cooking them inside .
if someone ste@@ als your belon@@ gings , is that annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added a det@@ erg@@ ent to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , the people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent man , but that you belong to people in the tru@@ est sense of the prover@@ b in the glass House .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something to make Drum &amp; Bass somewhat qui@@ eter because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they acted on it with more lau@@ er music .
when she finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbor to sleep for another two hours before she left their own music , shut up her door and ended up at her three hour trial .
would it not be romantic if your family sp@@ ouses would coinci@@ de with the same student residence ?
in other way , it would not be ab@@ le@@ aved by you , if you have a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future married couples who will come back to her and will see her again every day and perhaps , how they over@@ took all common friends ?
of course , the heart will go his own ways - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future wife , try at least to persu@@ ade your under@@ wear a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has its keys in its not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is close as it seems .
a good stre@@ ak is fun , but it only takes some moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
organize with plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but you never fail to get someone with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut up your door and put its keys in a glass of water which will then place in the freezer - but tor@@ ch their belon@@ gings at the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , single @-@ fle@@ dged , ger@@ ies
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds a lot of money in the Central @-@ Frank@@ ish ver@@ ter@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
thus for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the alone mother and the Ger@@ ing j@@ ail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to grow economically and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly cheaper homes can be created : he builds in a project ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees , will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the massive housing in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
because people remain in a great part here .
given the refugee flow we need enough living space in the next decades .
a very common , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a series of ag@@ ony needs the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
that is different , when people stop the people in blocks .
each of the six houses built right in the pilot project consists of three units of asylum seek@@ ers each .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees say , it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then the houses can be changed easily according to their needs .
how high are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is € 184 million , without any property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
this is reasonable .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I legally got my project correctly .
especially complicated the threat@@ ening Dam@@ oc@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert will always make special construction and the slot adjustment .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still underground , which creates three apartments in a series of connection , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their wh@@ ouse project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury ri@@ ms for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not right .
but do not spar@@ row the competition fight for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true , however , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but it was built for luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the alone mother or the Ger@@ ing Services .
I show you how to get cheap and well today .
this is why it works .

when ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it .
some are encounter@@ ed after installation without problems , as they are not@@ ing an error message that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to deal with the problem , users are advised to wait or wait for the ons@@ lau@@ ght or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean the del@@ etion of apps , but Apple has made it easier to do space , but also , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to install apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth making sure your mobile phone is charged while updating a charging device , so that the battery is charged .

it was sympathy for the first sight when the Fel@@ low began to get to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who currently completed her training in hospital in the hospital and wants to grow in practice a year .
&quot; we always had the mind that the m@@ iller will fit well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen and she laughs ,

the couple really liked the idea to put his own practice in As@@ endorf .

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also high on our border line , &quot; Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said .
the controls on the Hungarian border continue to keep up in parallel .
according to the fact that everyone who wants to ask for asylum seek@@ ers , that also could &quot; make &quot; of course . &quot;
the provision and safety of people stand in the foreground .
it is clear , however , &quot; that it requires clear signals , &quot; the Minister said .
people need to know that bound@@ less migration flows do not accept , nor by the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia cont@@ empl@@ ates &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would like to leave the coming refugees in direction to Austria and Germany and would also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather turn the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary .
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is strongly controlled at an outer edge of the Schengen area .
as the Minister has stressed , Slovenia wants to conf@@ ess its borders for refugees .
&quot; any EU member must fill out its duties , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; emphas@@ ized Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government fled , the first refugees had attempted in the night hours to Tuesday in the c@@ roati@@ a c@@ roati@@ a at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police allowed them to set up the corn fields in the near maize fields .
according to local media since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting with new refugees .
it is primarily used by Syrians , Afghanistan , among them many women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country with about 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would also turn to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media , on Wednesday .
but the government in Belgrade denied that it was to strike some kind of routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want us to do this , &quot; said it .
according to media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrive in the Serbian border town of S@@ id at the morning , during the day , further buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been traveling the whole night from the Macedonia some 500 kilometres distant to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia and Austria .
thus it could actually go to a somewhat further west route from the past in the Balkans to Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary into a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; extensive facilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had pointed out that his country for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees have prepared plans for possible shooting situations .
he did not name it , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had a &quot; extensive interface to limit control . &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been one of the EU partners since 2007 , consistently offering a good testimony to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees nation@@ wide behind the Hungarian border crossing .
according to the reports of media reports held the past night at the border of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border controls Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain fully blocked .
whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves continue to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stefan@@ ovic tried to re@@ ass@@ ure on Wednesday early at a local newspaper in Hor@@ gos : he stop the debates about Alternative Rou@@ tes from refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would currently not be about very high refugee numbers .
you can &apos;t say whether she would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
assistant advice to mig@@ rant - dangerous - Alternative Rou@@ tes
however , private Hungarian refugee aid has already begun to distribute refugees , where alternative routes are drawn from Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again , on the edge of little discussions of the action of itself , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I make clear that for me , at the end of this world , I can live in responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ itals .
therefore , this is a public effective action for 20 year old .
that not everyone wants to share publicly to the tables , however , is under@@ stand@@ able , eventually do it for a very personal thing .
the theme of death and dying were hairy still with tab@@ oos as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hosp@@ itals in recent years have contributed a lot to open the people .
a assessment that is shared by Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the steri@@ lization and fun@@ eral holder belongs to the honorary employees of the first hour .
confronted with personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ itals was asked for a call to volunteer , she was reported immediately and was there with the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ ble@@ bee belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the person concerned and relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes , and in hosp@@ ice St Vincent .
all are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid is well with their task and to deal with their experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ te , consider it very precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says .
the Offer of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ itals is free of charge and cost @-@ to @-@ date .
the financial support of the medical insurance funds and donations will facilitate the training , training courses and super@@ vis@@ as of the ster@@ ile and tragedy .
all two years training will be offered for new employees .
the panels described here are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
also there can be other personal wishes be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports the final results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ver @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his profit margin for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to present about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers on vacation .
at this time , last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share fell over 2.5 percent of the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a win between 10.@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than with previous forecast .
analysts were expecting a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.4 million .
the lower prosp@@ ect comes in spite of the price increases , which will reach an average of 4.@@ 9 per cent and on January 4 , and in spite of higher ratings for bo@@ d@@ le@@ sites of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that it nevertheless suggested that the result would be increased from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue , and growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achieves solid yields , considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for vacation employment have been announced one day later than those of the R@@ ival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra labour , about the same amount as last year .
in the first quarter of August , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex was 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than last year .
earnings per share came to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research , analysts predi@@ ct analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
analysts were asked about 12.@@ 23 billion dollars from Z@@ acks .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international high priority shipping that has been stag@@ nat@@ ing through its unit Express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent in the body transport segment , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher sales due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
at the Pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares rose by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,15 per .
on Tuesday she took 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on her most a@@ waited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ali@@ ans spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any @-@ table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time to lift the lad@@ le for the first time since almost a decade .
threat@@ ening over them at an end of the double @-@ floor seat post , there is a wall picture of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put down the economic interests of the nation before all the other things .
the Central Bank has held a double order from Congress : Maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is a third and third mand@@ at : financial stability .
and this third Mand@@ ate could be the X factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the un@@ preced@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy is showing that it is solid , the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il could do well on the global financial markets that have already over@@ seen F@@ ed representatives to increase this Vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest rate for federal government - and be it only by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important which they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , head of economics at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty in order to continue the global market enough to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led to the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists , which were test@@ ified recently from Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate of interest this week .
the financial markets are expected to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the shr@@ ine drops the blow as they promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones handled industrial average score of 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed politics impos@@ es the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would take the sentences at that point , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; it would go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they are not in panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a rate of interest would calm the financial markets because it would take in@@ security when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good path to increase the movement by 0.@@ 25 percentage points out this month , the first small step in a slow deteri@@ oration of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ els had said that in this year , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , more economic adv@@ ances would be required to increase the proposition .
though the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and in the vicinity of the levels , which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
although the inflation remained constant at the beginning of the 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the principal reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets throughout the world ended up at the end of the month after China had dev@@ alu@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell in May by more than 16 % below its highest level , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cover global growth .
the market has a rest of the market this month , the Dow is now nearly 10 % lower than that of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives the market turbul@@ ence affect the complex calculation , when earnings increase interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in the last few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. emergency database .
now he says that she would have to wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of in@@ security about what affects the effects of the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the global economy of the global economy is none of the companies , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end @-@ aspect , the F@@ ed currency agency has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the bare reference of the former leader , Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could fall her mon@@ et@@ ric expansion . &quot; could cause confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly inter@@ woven , they can not only monitor the developments at other locations , but also with other central banks and experts advise to get a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey Sha@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA conducted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of reactions on financial market movements that seem to be associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;
painted , vocal member of the Federal Open Market Committee , imposed for a interest rate , iti@@ oned Dec@@ isions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia introduced the F@@ ed to reduce its lead by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite a limit@@ less impact on growth in the US &quot; , he said .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these reductions .
F@@ ed should create aspects of financial stability in the first place during a serious crisis as the mark@@ er outbreak in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est of the Bank of England .
the youngest rac@@ ism are not coming close to this level , he said .
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to go into the situation where they are afraid of a interest rate , because the markets upset , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think they should take up time .

more and more refugees arrive in Germany during these days .
a warm welcome to you , does not work without the engagement of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support invisible asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .

Brazilian Amazon RA@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande supports food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian Pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Organisation of SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy how important good nutrition is as important during the lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that are painted on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of in@@ healthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies that need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary requirements that mothers should carry .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the construction agreement for the 2.3 million Euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar system .
planning for the long @-@ desired gym hall on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds step forward step by step : in the recent meeting of the municipal council , the worked construction application has been unanim@@ ously approved without large discussions .
prior to this , the panel had also decided on a structural &quot; exception &quot; respect , &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; from valid building plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; correspon@@ ded to the conditions for a special form regarding the roof structure .
therefore , a &quot; saddle kno@@ b &quot; should be erected with the non @-@ mit@@ ig@@ ated first and roof@@ top .
in the background the planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar panels , &quot; we got together a wonderfully large South African , &quot; says mayor Joseph St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; exemp@@ tion , &quot; the roof p@@ inc@@ lin@@ ation , made from energetic reasons - was required differently than in the development plan - below ten degrees .
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan no exceptions prove on the roof of the roof , with which the Bern@@ rie@@ der Associ@@ ate is rather restri@@ ctive for the liberation of liberation .
but there is no recur@@ ring project at the gym : &quot; we do not create a prec@@ e@@ dence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the Turn@@ halle at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bern@@ lo@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated in costs .
subsi@@ dies are expected from school and lat@@ itude exploration .
in the following procedure the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter will now be submitted to the Council and the exam .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital will be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the surprising plans of the county GmbH of the county GmbH before , confirmed by the Land@@ r@@ attle in Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , we decide to make a decision on the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ acting on Wednesday 23rd September .
if the plans are implemented , all of the 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority of moving together with Fischer and the continuing center stop to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot travel to Sch@@ ong@@ au shall be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the staff were informed of the plans .
the change has caused the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the tender clinic of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and has now changed to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; fishermen &quot; came into play with his question , who declared himself willing to take over the line from 1 October and change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in every case has a &quot; dev@@ alu@@ ation &quot; and a spreading of the provision in the &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; area , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fisher@@ man is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the interior Station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years f@@ ishers will be f@@ ishers with his team , when the Supervisory Board is agre@@ eing to both houses , until then in the next year the former hospital of the kin@@ ship , which still has more than 35 beds , should finally be closed after almost 140 years .
the county has previously planned for 2018 , when the current rehabilitation is currently being taken at the hospital of W@@ eil@@ heim .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors , confirms that the house , which is owned by the federal cli@@ ent@@ ele , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not tell , there are several consider@@ ations .
currently there are a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a conference room sych@@ iat@@ ric .
&quot; what better could not happen , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; fishermen over the Qu@@ asi Moving to the Le@@ ch , who had been positive and very under@@ stand@@ able by the employees . &quot;
a true perspective for the house in which fisher@@ man has worked as a Head Physi@@ cian for more than 30 years .
he was asked of Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again in recent decades and again marked by closure , departments became closed , for example the surgery and the birth help .

a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pfalz has been killed for a victim since Saturday .
the young lady &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police told on Wednesday .

refugees need accommodations : study warnings of residential property
the situation on the German residential property is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a affordable stay .
printing on the residential property is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the combined events on the German residential property have long since begun .
with the refugees and jobs coming from the EU more and more people push for a market that is over@@ loaded in many large cities now .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens to achieve the last affordable housing .
in order to cover demand for affordable housing , the 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built by 2020 .
the result will be a study on behalf of the association &apos;s social housing . &quot;
to compare : this year 26@@ 0,000 units are finished .
this means 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial shelter .
many put them in the housing market and rows in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to Statist@@ ical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers have lived in the last year .
but the negative development of the apartment market lies however not only to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable dis@@ ables in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany p@@ ushes a housing deficit ahead of itself , which is t@@ aller from year to year .
currently , in the metrop@@ olitan areas around 77@@ 0.000 living units , Matthias Günther compl@@ ains , author of the study .
so many working professionals are living in large cities listed in WG rooms .
young adults remained illegal in the residential property for no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in large cities the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen in the past few years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social housing again .
thus the atro@@ city tax could be avoided and the property tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments will be exposed .
the Alliance provides attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation and am@@ ort@@ isation possibilities .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee subsi@@ dy for the State Bank Kf@@ W come now well in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was posted on Monday night with 184 million euros already more than half of which had been available around 300 million euros .
now the project might even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up the corridor
according to Hungary , practically no more will come through , since more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces the transit of Slovenia after north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Slovenian inter@@ minist@@ erial , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and belongs already to the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the sealing of the Serbian border , hundreds of refugees fled to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RTL .
Hungary was sealed on the day before his border for refugees .
new laws that compet@@ ed in force on the same day , super@@ vis@@ m asylum procedures in Hungary are practically unnecessary .
Croatia will let the refugees suffer .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; they can travel and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there were people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the Serbian border to the EU neighbourhood on Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reports reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with Tax@@ es in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after her arrival , they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
while the Croatian @-@ Serb border the refugees won &apos;t reach the fence .
for this , the border strip other dangers : there are sharp mines there from the Yugosla@@ v Civil War in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ ields are now swi@@ ft@@ ly create a secure passage .
according to Hungary , barely more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
the police , on Tuesday , attracted 3@@ 66 people .
in short , on Monday there had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws regul@@ ate the over@@ coming and damage of the border dispute as an off@@ ence .
thus , 35 trials were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted were sentenced to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , I received a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday in the new &quot; Trans@@ cl@@ oning &quot; border , including almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically , however , nobody has granted any chance to receive asylum in Hungary .
after a Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to wake up .
they gathered up the garbage , which had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
plywood have been dismant@@ led and one of the top @-@ bearings in the border has been rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express this re@@ building .
still a few refugees arrive in Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
moreover , the country has strengthened its border controls .
but to the 20,000 immigrants , however , the government took place still in the country .
in Salzburg some 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees meet on foot regularly .
Mayor drove over the border &quot;
&quot; we were busy at the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday with the clean rooms , as suddenly ten people were standing by travel officials at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passau .
because Germany had surprisingly successfully dis@@ continued the railway traffic on Sunday because of the refugee flow in Austria , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the stran@@ ded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border to the river Na@@ he Passau .
before that we had the un@@ loved guests agreed only once , with a break and drink .
we said it in the same way , we bring it to Passau with the car .
&quot; that was of course , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very happy for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the not@@ ched towing boards went on Sunday evening at W@@ els by a ICE in a regional train to Passau , in order to prove it after the short term that railway traffic was closed to Germany , but still to try across the border .
but the regional train was off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein near the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ crossing occurs generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest has been soci@@ able with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a day before a two @-@ br@@ ushing race - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending thousands of us to us , is a logical result of an intimate policy :
rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke right at the erection of structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has struck highly public and publicly backed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ geons of National Soci@@ alism .
ser@@ d@@ speakers of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions .
the wings also will have to realize that the Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land , &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be one more bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search for 35@@ ,000 winter festivals
Konrad served to do all his hands with the refugee .
Christian Konrad , it is used to bear his word .
the government has set up the former ruling Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to provide vou@@ chers for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first emergency centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been in the control .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success .
the total accommodation of 20,000 refugees , which had come to Austria on Monday came to be without big vor@@ tex , Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master performance . &quot;
the Interior Ministry spoke of &quot; a ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in all , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 remains in the he@@ ur@@ y year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units have to be found in the next weeks - 20.000 are supposed to provide 15,000 accommodation units .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but there &apos;s no barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad said .
he has already led talks to the capit@@ als .
they would have secured him , even to create quot@@ a for the next refugees .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it goes well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is supported by Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
great expect@@ ation puts the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator in the ORF action &quot; hel@@ pers as we . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , it hopes for hotels that stand empty in winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for the accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
in terms of emergency , it could not be that a certain amount of the towel holder or the height of the above have to be stopped .
&quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply to a temporary time .
in contrast to the Home Ministry of Home Affairs , Konrad founded his experience with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , who is not without further notice in the face of fol@@ ly .
convic@@ tion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic as they declared themselves .
their number of employees want to increase it to three to four .
the own query @-@ search has not yet been successful yet .
Konrad intended to set a container at the step@@ han@@ splatz in office .
but there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better distribution
only no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design centre to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary , as the person affected could currently under@@ line these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for the emergency , however , further locations are to be tested on their do@@ vi@@ ability .
criticism : the head of the city is due to the distribution of refugees inside the federal state .
other districts too have to contribute its contribution .
See@@ hofer : &quot; bo@@ unds are not sealed &quot;
in a longer call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , state capit@@ als Josef P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) gave more information on Monday in the refugee question .
See@@ hofer gave me assured that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuing travel of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is the relevant border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the guards would however bring regular trains to Germany .
from other EU member states P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger demanded more stronger solidarity in the refugee question .
it is a logical follow @-@ up for P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger , a logical follow @-@ up for the action of the Germans as well as Austria at its borders .
the next Run@@ tastic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Linz industrial line has been officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is intended to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine how to invest in startup firms of the New Ship@@ yard , and later also acquiring the new ship@@ yard .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T aims to cooperate with new neighbours - from where there is a lot of rainf@@ all : &quot; the next Run@@ tastic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the state Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is on lease to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center from Linz AG for 60 years .
30 percent of the 2700 square metre area in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent give requests .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ ende@@ avor opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are located in the new shop .
he actually wanted to put a dog in Jutta .
this project had to catch up the 49 year old veter@@ an of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the do@@ ck@@ market arch near @-@ sigh@@ ing : finally , it has now got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop against the business meeting in which they sold bags , suitcase , footwear and clothing of different manufacturers , everything about Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
big bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
a few weeks ago it was rebuilt .
&quot; but I am persu@@ aded that I should open a store &quot; , &quot; says wide .
what decision was decisive for the decision , among other things that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots .
her fashion interest has got broad@@ ly placed from her m@@ um into the cra@@ dle .
I share the most if something develops and I can show new trends at high rates .
why , as some woman is seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce , the professional wife cannot answer the last safety .
maybe it is because a nice bag evalu@@ ates every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the el@@ dest ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came out of a place whose residents are called An@@ gi@@ ans .
this property also connects some men with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for pur@@ ging .
whether he speaks strange @-@ host@@ ly , journalists is concerned or lack of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office ch@@ illing the campaign strongly .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the Ga@@ el@@ ic K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property portfolio originate .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept for many in the wine district along the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to -@@ zig corners along with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in voting mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
what are the vill@@ agers about his goal , become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think you &apos;ll find it exciting , but not so deeply impressed by their cult way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native of K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary on the place and his famous children &apos;s spro@@ uts , among which Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - thus with the statement that it would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a little mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random scores the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher , &quot; - too high @-@ German : the gi@@ ver , says she .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when his later grandfather immig@@ rated and in the US opened a Local for Gold Rush .
foundations of the property company were the first base of found@@ land in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the native country , to whom the Pal@@ at@@ inate was absent from that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once bored without permission , had director of the Institute of pf@@ äl@@ z history and folk finds , Roland Paul , to film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is contrary to the sharp@@ ly notable statements of the follow @-@ up .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and asked the construction of a boundary walls to fri@@ gh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ling , that is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote @-@ born Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born pot@@ ump , &quot; a born Heinz &quot; ) .
the Americans fore@@ sees the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; he is always so ar@@ resting . &quot;
does he believe Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine &quot; the 72 @-@ year @-@ old says .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm reports like some K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family , with a visit something for the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; I cannot imagine this with Donald , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the S@@ agen for the time of his grandfather in the US as he had , he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; it gives more interesting threads than it , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ k@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els film which was inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 movie fans , even in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened .
the Upper Bavarian municipality Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing district . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park won the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ d@@ ör@@ fer &quot; there .
in neighbouring country the local club is responsible for awar@@ ding of the award .
a &quot; mountain bra@@ zi@@ dorf &quot; must have at most 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be declared a protected area .
Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stefan@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ts to Can@@ ber@@ ra , in order to report on the loss of re@@ ader@@ ship of liber@@ als , but there has no major shifts in the reviews for Today .
the Nine @-@ show of Nine was released by the federal provincial capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ around gave the down@@ fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ths , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this draw@@ back of resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise generated an average of 39@@ 7,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ .000 .
today , a slight increase in comparison to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , I concluded the gap on Sun@@ rise in the past few months .
in August Today posted an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise .
during the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 exceeded .
so far in September sunrise with an average number of 34@@ 9,000 spectators came to about 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Charles and Lisa are fine , thank you for checking !

the last three match : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
un@@ disclos@@ ed secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki apparently do not know who The bach@@ elor is gaining .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was ro@@ ar@@ ed in great sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we came to Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood has sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have left their way in ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? , &quot; they might become the game @-@ destro@@ ying who won the heart of the Bach .
both Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I entered into the house and when I noticed in the house ( Sarah &apos;s ) and SA@@ MS energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the whole show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground for both feet and it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were good suited to a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the last week &apos;s visit had made clear that Wood &quot; could be one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose when she was not pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast at Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests to his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some coaches would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game , when he lost a pair of comm@@ otion as it was the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by League conver@@ tit with his first pun@@ t @-@ return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to pun@@ t return and also into the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding the ro@@ ok@@ ies , he encouraged her to gr@@ ind the mill .
Tom@@ as@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne also in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sports rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the speci@@ al@@ ams of Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ched catch and bo@@ ther to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne appears in a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota .
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian re@@ gency for his N@@ FL debut .

for slightly thought di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for mild overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether lightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data requires a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an author of the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years have proven O@@ bes@@ ity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ro@@ sh@@ outs - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI among those were under@@ gone this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI with those non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were received approximately at 29 .
among those who under@@ gone a surgical procedure , 36 % of diabetes cases burst completely , and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with the diabetes , only approximately two percent dissolved itself in comparison with the diabetes .
in addition , the results were found in the control of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol , &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held below 7 percent , writing the researchers .
following surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control , &quot; - as did not reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ re@@ ct@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching major returns in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival advantage of the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden that leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was under@@ gone by a obes@@ e person who had under@@ gone an Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tested conventional methods .
although the new study was no advantage for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said , let it be re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BMI less than 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their physi@@ cians should begin to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe - &quot; Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe can not record all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East fly .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to stop the violence in the emerging countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the prolonged refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he required that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be set before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis was admir@@ able , but the situation is in@@ adequate .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama glorified Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he emphas@@ ized that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on the terrorist attack of 11th September and issued that the violent response of the USA went out a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to resol@@ ving this issue lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put up violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
reasons from taking of hands disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the past 4 years
tox@@ ins in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , if you swal@@ low alcoholic disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases reported from hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years of age , which report on tox@@ ins , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are more frequently coming to those products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the not@@ ch , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children were disinf@@ ect@@ ant inten@@ tionally drinking , while some do it to im@@ press her friends or because of a mut@@ ation at the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young professionals can disinf@@ ect@@ ant just cause a budget experience .
young people have report@@ edly re@@ mixed any disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mouth water to preserve a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very appe@@ aling for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in small children , few sp@@ ills can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the head office at the University of Kansas City Hospital , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any swal@@ low whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year old girl , recently taken four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry dual @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school was brought to treatment .
your blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered in@@ tox@@ icated by an adult , said Dr. Chris Bar@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who she treated in G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center out of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laughed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors super@@ vis@@ aged them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl fell by the alcohol and had caught up the head , was b@@ og@@ ey .
&quot; it was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ant outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected to death cases .
in 2013 two women in Ontario died , after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an agent .
in January , three students in the fourth class in New York State were plan@@ ed to conv@@ ey their &quot; common &quot; teacher , having anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; so it reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to ham@@ let inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ fications and ban@@ ished them from their space .
the police came through the negoti@@ ated plan as &quot; s@@ wer@@ ät@@ z &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authorities .

for the alleged vehicles were caused by some 10 000 euros , the police divide the police .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be dra@@ gged .
sc@@ aff@@ olds : no disc@@ ord appearance at Celtic
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk from Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , telling D@@ eil@@ a that the h@@ ows are on a bad spot , but that he will turn again .
heard a hearing by SF@@ A because of the accus@@ ation of N@@ eil@@ son and War@@ bur@@ ton to be careful in January new obligations that could destroy the unity of the squ@@ ad
D@@ ons increase the Celtic voyage to five points
Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half season has caused a fierce victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths Play talk about disc@@ ord @-@ mon@@ ie
there are rum@@ ors of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was dismissed spont@@ ane@@ ously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he in@@ sist@@ ed that he and his team comra@@ des do not stand under elevated control , as they prepare for the confron@@ tation with the Dutch championship leader .
I do not believe that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football stadium Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former rank @-@ fiel@@ der and former national player from the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic people , there are no title ri@@ val@@ ry with Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights from Celtic games , and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here not only talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onny D@@ eil@@ a accepted that Celtic fighting has to fight , but the Norwegian boss had to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the following ex@@ crete from the Champions League , the defeat of 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , has now followed with five points lead to the top of the table .
D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; Celtic people had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .
we feel it &apos;s the same - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because it makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton , careful in January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , it pointed out that he hur@@ ried on some January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ boss Mark Kes@@ bur@@ ton is careful with the signing of new arri@@ es and in@@ sist@@ ed that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
the players who come in the summer will have this low season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group of this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes , more damage is done by adding unnecessary players what you really need .
Celtic @-@ Ziel@@ man Mich@@ u with withdrawal request
S@@ wan@@ sea storms Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , has announced that he could go back when his contract runs at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has pl@@ agu@@ ed herself with a former Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les for two years and didn &apos;t manage the dive from Wales in this summer .
hearing on SF@@ A battle for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
the hearing carried 2 : 1 when pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the red card of the defender was cancelled later - the third red card of Col@@ l@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
N@@ eil@@ son is what he said : &quot; I haven &apos;t asked any integrity in question , I have not commented on any performance . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars , ty@@ ran@@ n@@ ak@@ castle to avoid
the in@@ cor@@ di@@ ous Hi@@ bee was rejected when he admitted to have sung a song with cont@@ est@@ ing texts about former @-@ heard player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh one Edinburgh Der@@ by in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment &apos; , said the storms and added : &quot; it is safe to say that I will not return to Ty@@ re , when it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce supervisory board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Donn@@ el@@ ly in@@ sist@@ ed that Dun@@ dee United has still confidence in the management team to turn things - but he stands that the decline has to be on the pitch .
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us .
we will bring the boys back onto Tra@@ b , &quot; said Donn@@ el@@ ly .
Mc@@ Inn@@ es was glad to win over Hamilton &quot; un@@ beautiful . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es not@@ ion that his team of Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to compete for a seventh consecutive league victory , which gave them one advantage of five points ahead of Celtic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; There &apos;s no team that won everything , play poker , or lip who won &apos;t have won games of this kind . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK there is a total increase .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July in 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom emerged as a whole in the same period around 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent stood above the 5.5 percent level showing the numbers of the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - an average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the newest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements to the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .
dr@@ unken the process
as the security guards could not satisfactory the location , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could put the stor@@ ks in custody .
a respir@@ atory test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.0@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the her@@ der was picked up from his mother .
a 28 year old boy had 2,@@ 15 per mil@@ le , and remained in custody at first .
why I will be an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch as a man is being put to death .
if it happens and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a viewer gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is expressed by the le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day goes closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the US , and as many times more applications are available as places , a loose lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
those who are selected will be emotional watching .
I can &apos;t do that .
apart from Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will be seated with whom I developed my own connection over the months with calls and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot , when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness , a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a notebook and a pin to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remind me of all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the conscience as it wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained about it .
she acknowledged that &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but it still believes that it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work in the Movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Podcasts which I have done .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I can &apos;t say to certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would owe him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orter by which you can turn about .
what you will get of me is what it means to die a man who kills any unnecessary death .
man , after fir@@ ing police ch@@ ases , persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he spoke the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man from Perth , to leave the police , was un@@ successful when he was in sil@@ ky and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officers who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house @-@ quar@@ ry incident in Bec@@ ken@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape the C@@ anning River in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come so far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform tac@@ tic , so he turned a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try and escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
master@@ y soccer player Ben Cou@@ sins provides an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , Cou@@ sins brought his car to the tren@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to record him and threatened to finish racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he targeted at ste@@ wards and the Integration Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai , on the last straw on Wednesday , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media , that he is always trying to do what is best for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it went to explain the positive cob@@ alt shri@@ mp test at Li@@ dar@@ is that he could not explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the esp@@ ion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want to see it as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid of saying nothing , and I have long prepared for it , but sometimes you are as fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know that it will be far@@ ing .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around my head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I must think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had brought the bomb into an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integ@@ rity division had attempted to sp@@ ying his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , seated in a room with a man - I am asked , and offered him jobs in my st@@ ables , to give information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ing .
if that is the case , they should certainly be able to touch their n@@ oses , because they have attempted to put me in the attempt .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ das , current CEO of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I make this opinion , that it will personally ?
has the RV@@ L have a celeb@@ rat@@ ory behavior and maybe people outside coaches are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take me my license and get me down , and I have no doubt that what I say is about to think about it now .
but now I am at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
I will exercise pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the trainer have been built up with the long lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching brought he that he could &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the incomplete master of the Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ day treatment of ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay on the horse@@ back had been put , what against the rules ru@@ ined .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to take over the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my employees fal@@ sely applied s@@ lu@@ dge on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , what was that way .
it was the race day as well .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a triple discount for treatment with the pack on race day . an investigation into this issue was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules , do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy gri@@ ps with ri@@ vals to fight ring charges against ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy shows criticism of his players as a &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney RO@@ O@@ ST@@ ERS Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee may have allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring strug@@ gles &quot; with his team during the high Storm @-@ Sie@@ gs &apos;s qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a scar@@ c@@ ous comment on the Storm team , after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample case &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the team in his team and said that she was just concentrated in tac@@ kling the &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy supp@@ os@@ edly added that the criticism of his team led him confi@@ dently to his team , since it de@@ fied that they weren &apos;t worried about being defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; it dives all over again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ tac@@ kles when she talked about 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we did nothing in our def@@ ensive system or techniques in the last six weeks , but in the last six weeks we made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus and this has provided the trend revers@@ al for us .
Tr@@ ent is there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . it is therefore probably not used to get used to it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is strange , as this emerges again at that time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has hosted the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and re@@ minded his mentor that Benn@@ us St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; more boring &quot; soccer .
Wayne is talking about exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was being a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we view as excit@@ ingly , in particular his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play .
I build more confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of it when it went to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against RO@@ O@@ ST@@ ERS played a higher result than the game Bron@@ co to Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points any tension ?
for me it is the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase still .
the Storm team is free on this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the finals in A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200.000 $ deposit to drug action
a man who probably threat@@ ens a lifetime punishment because of his succ@@ ul@@ ent to come into the property of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Queens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested during the last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and put in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed when he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially living penalty for attemp@@ ting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café they could have been a harmless reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the risk of danger at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the pen@@ al court , he su@@ cked the Police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ able Mutter and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars for security to reach his release .
&quot; following reading the si@@ ze@@ able explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; says Richter Flan@@ agan .
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to stop him from it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was set free on the deposit , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and Serbian passport to take care of the police daily and adher@@ es to an output barrier from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driving home away apart
a truck driver has been seriously injured during a dri@@ ve@@ way with three trucks on the Motor@@ way 5 at Karlsruhe .
two of the three lor@@ ries followed one of the three cars involved in the direction of Basel .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used the phone of girls to attract pupils to send images
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g accepted the phone of the girl when this slept , log@@ ist@@ ed into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ contin@@ ual pictures of children who were sent to him from another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through her , found her conf@@ using news and al@@ armed her mother immediately .
the police looked on it and saw the five images , then analysed computer which was found under the address and discovered the &quot; web research which used terms for brow@@ sing pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; P@@ ec@@ tor@@ h@@ ile in the internet , &quot; and he then referred to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten her . &quot;
the At@@ tor@@ ney Officer E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ dee Sher@@ iff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction that he is ad@@ di@@ cted to fri@@ gh@@ ten people .
he said that searches on the computer were done by him , but said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten punishment .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did so , to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in his head , when he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and at tears .
it then saw the un@@ ceas@@ ing pictures on the telephone and con@@ front the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused Computer and Play@@ station used to talk with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , declared to have recorded invol@@ un@@ ting pictures of children on 14 June last year to have exp@@ ired against the editions of the 25th of this year and not before the court to be appearing on 24 March of this year .
Secretary @-@ Ad@@ voc@@ ate Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g doesn &apos;t appear in the register of sexual off@@ ense , you could argue that &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; is to be found in his off@@ ence .
Sher@@ iff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael be postpon@@ ed to the verdict of October to give background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case but was held in temporary detention for hear@@ ings to other cases .
he was still recorded before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual off@@ ences .
cat@@ user differ on small border cros@@ sings to Germany
more and more refugees away from the large @-@ border controls on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks were made from fear of discovery and determination of the people in smaller mar@@ g@@ inal trans@@ itions .
on the Austrian side , a speaker of the Federal Police said .
along the river Inn Inn in Passau and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn have risen more than 1000 refugees since Tuesday .
they were walking over bridges and dust on the German side .
there they are taken into service by police police and for@@ warded to the registration .
at the Munich central train station , in comparison to the beginning of the weekend , more refugees meet again in comparison to the weekend of the weekend .
there were approximately 700 people at the provincial capital alone , but a speaker said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of inspec@@ tions on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ erun@@ ners of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in southwest
met@@ e@@ ologists war@@ n against wh@@ irl@@ winds in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a low @-@ pressure area on Western Europe , warm ocean currents in the country , the German weather Service ( D@@ W ) divided into Stuttgart .
the powerful cruci@@ ble is the f@@ ooth@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled in the ocean from the Bermuda Islands over the past days .
storms and storms are especially expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD it is also possible to calculate until Thursday until Thursday , in the Black Forest , on the Schw@@ ä@@ b@@ ische Al@@ b and the Sun@@ seek@@ er circle with ar@@ ches ranging from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
the sun is spe@@ eded up again on Friday .
the mass does it : all two years show the car manufacturer at the IAA for their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is especially popular with the vehicles that are currently particularly well @-@ sold .
cars from the compact class cars are currently especially popular : about 28@@ .1 percent of all new appro@@ vals fell out of force at the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days 17th to 27th of September ) .
this year , among all the futur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be in autumn by the dealers .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann pointed out to the show .
it belongs to the brand core .
the new Astra is also not much more expensive for this new Astra range .
Opel is stepp@@ ing into the VW Golf in view of its biggest competition , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ essi@@ ans offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five .
as the second option I will follow the Com@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA .
and what will be opened next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra compet@@ itor Mé@@ gan@@ e racing .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cells are human un@@ worthy
the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht ) has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel judge for Justice in which he was housed in a small cell for many months .
because of injury to their human dignity , in@@ mates in@@ corporate financial compensation , if they are in too small cells .
this decision had decided by the German Constitutional Court in a resolution on Wednesday .
those affected may even hope to raise money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was in a sing@@ ular cell of Berlin from June to November 2009 with some five square metres floor space ; the toilet was not seper@@ ated .
after that , the man , who has now returned to the free foot according to his candidate , was moved into a bigger cell .
his responsibilities are due to the inno@@ c@@ ence due to the incur@@ able conditions against the country of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional judges raised the judgment of the chamber in Berlin and will return the case for re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation .
even if jur@@ idi@@ cal reasons are decisive for the compensation period only a few days of arrest for the compensation , it was given a compensation statement , and was called it .
otherwise it would be entitled to worry about the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber court must now clear the amount of damage .
the constitu@@ encies have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of pris@@ ons in the past .
thus they said only in April of a prisoner of damages , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to the 2011 election , a decision from 2011 also consists of a cell &apos;s multi @-@ cabin crew without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which issued a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ case in November 2009 , also confirmed a decent accommodation .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was housed between 15 and 21 hours daily in a similar cell in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were in the head@@ lines in the last weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always tra@@ pped in 23 hours , and the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising up to itself , because it is said to have already occurred because of the cl@@ amped location .
after the court of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel do not occupy because of young persons for young persons , 19 should be om@@ itted in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we can do this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or has decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are projected according to the forecasts of the Austrian Ministry of Women from this year to Germany , according to the vice @-@ president of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we create it . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to various forecasts , it is needed between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Pest@@ el Institute ) every year - and the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatically , the lack of living space but mainly in paid rental objects : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing falling out of the rental price are incur@@ red , and in order to apply for these special discounts .
for this reason the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the perspective of the pest@@ le Institute : 80 000 social apartments each year would have to arise and therefore the federal government should have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more control items for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not have been systematically asked about their qualification in order to help them start with , critic@@ ized Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the este@@ em in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich th@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ issu@@ hardt it has made a political change : from the Labour Court for Refu@@ ge@@ es for the recognition of work .
while previously a labour market for asylum seek@@ ers was reduced from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the resi@@ den@@ ability to asylum seek@@ ers .
in society , it has also penet@@ rated the view on the labour market - mainly because refugees to access the labour market .
a wide hur@@ dle to access the labour market is missing German .
so far there is no sufficient supply of public and professional language courses .
research also shows that work@@ stations are most frequently medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
this is why the buil@@ ders of networks is from the throne of the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has established that only a few , parents gave their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated that 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the pur@@ sed parents , it is only important once to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ haz@@ ard , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , our list is distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators rose sharp@@ ly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity , by allowing more technical colle@@ ges .
students without German language skills are prepared in the countries .
but they are not always taught by well trained teachers and teachers , but also in Berlin , also of teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate fil@@ thy suit@@ cases from the Berlin school .
the Deutscher Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
generally , none of the federal land seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the interior operator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has given up his position to this position .
for studying refugees , access to the university could be facilit@@ ated .
for refugees with an permit or an appe@@ tizer do not have any achievements after the asylum seek@@ er , when they begin studying .
the latter always has no BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , as they are not falling under the circle of b@@ af@@ able persons .
report@@ edly refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G to be eligible for 15 months from 1 January 2016 .
however , this gap must also be closed , ask Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Affairs .
the students should immediately get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will in future be a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and many religions are an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually include the same rights as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ churches law to a new state @-@ religions .
it would be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who cares professionally for new@@ com@@ ers .
also duties belong to the Rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must be on clear contacts and ready to work together with the state in many areas and some control possibilities .
this also includes the read@@ iness to control unit against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed the anxiety , religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
those who wanted to au@@ dition such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay in Germany here , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the basic law in Arabic .
integration will be a lot more than now a subject of society .
this will also change the majority society , the winding of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more urgent .
namely , Germany - as a result of European decisions - a non @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NSU @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities , the rac@@ ist motive are systematically ignored .
the same chances for all : what Mig@@ rant organisations and the stak@@ eholders &apos; groups are calling for a long time and why international agreements have to become reality far in the coming years , if the country will remain peace@@ fully and their new citizens should use their opportunities - for the sake of all .
generally , Germany is able to provide medical insurance to the so far @-@ anticipated refugees , &quot; medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we accomplish this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money into the system must flow .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is required to hand out all strangers directly with registration and typ@@ ing .
achievements could be cancelled later with federal states .
and long term , it is highly question@@ able to find so many people with the limited power catalogue to see the asylum application .
otherwise , the doctors will mainly make the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health schol@@ ar The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven that migrants are worse than their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in physician practices , needs to be taken over and demands .
many refugees , however , already helped with more generally medical stop out@@ patients in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
under refugee children there are much more untreated disabilities , and with yo@@ ungst@@ ers it is about HIV en@@ lighten@@ ment .
but with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors come from their education , but clearly says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to see . &quot; and what about the trouble of trouble is perhaps a relief in sight by the refugees .
the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees , even physi@@ cians .
to practice , however , they would have to re@@ prove their quali@@ fications and then again to ex@@ ag@@ itate tests .
at least half of the refugees in Germany have been ill @-@ ill ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) estimates . most of them suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children , who particularly vulner@@ able , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recently published study of TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee population has trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac , and death anxi@@ ous .
more symptoms are sleep and lack of concentration , strong fl@@ are and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , early treatment was necessary , said Mun@@ z .
however until now only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill people get a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for Psycho@@ therapy , the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; Passion &quot; the Circus Festival takes up the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of intri@@ gu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Festival will start in the arena on a brick and do dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine &quot; living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , Animal teacher and Juni@@ os@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto of the present Man@@ e@@ gen@@ st@@ ination .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to inspiration is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us who pick people away from their day and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; said the 27 year old Juni@@ os@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; a cocktail @-@ cocktail with a world city @-@ fl@@ air , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this fl@@ air .
the cir@@ cus program convinces by talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown will attract the audience with hum@@ our and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also do their craft .
it also wants to hold the Cuban duo with the hero of the silent film .
light@@ ness and flexibility - identify with these words .
your hum@@ orous art in the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
besides the numerous salmon sp@@ ends the ac@@ rob@@ atic of the Circus also comes with finger@@ tips and artic@@ ular .
balance with the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
sn@@ ake men fascin@@ ate and fri@@ gh@@ ten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ izes Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ uses in the attitude of zir@@ cons are just too often the subject with various animal protection organisations .
in addition Stephanie Pro@@ bst takes his position : &quot; we don &apos;t do well with our animals , it is also not good . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying every string .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are called loving , is read off at any desire of the eyes .
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel good , it will also not want to be in the ring .
the upper@@ most command therefore : good for the animals .
especially on your Zeb@@ ra Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ ear pon@@ y dog and a zeb@@ ra@@ dish , the family Pro@@ bst proudly .
the two animals have lived in a tra@@ verse for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the Zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 audience , we will always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 20 am .
the programme starts on Sunday at 11 am and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the vet check is open from 10 a.m. to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe President Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , was down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the falls quickly spread over social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by MPs of the opposition , that they would have been preserved for anonymous being threatened to be threatened by Mr Mu@@ gabe to accompany Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well .
last month they had stretched out him and cut him away during his speech on the state of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition polit@@ ician SMS messages received from their cell phones they were warning about to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; the news comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es .
it war@@ ns the affected Parliament members , that the imm@@ unity ends in the Parliament and once they leave the parliament its parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
the spokes@@ man said that by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , party is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers of politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will create up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard will presumably allow 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and will separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job reduction will result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter of 2014 , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused on the HP today , and we have a wide and set portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better placed than ever before to satisfy changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and will now be limited to the provision of un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill ( Hewlett @-@ Packard Packard ) in order to manufacture electro @-@ plants and the Palo Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ organisation to manage the traffic from traditional computers to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the newest in this area based on the belief that closely focused businesses produce a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates need to stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the ver@@ last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ er
turning to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only in September and if his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario said that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history is his participation in the next summer on the European Championship for sure .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then back to its old momentum during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury not threat@@ ens the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that healed not well .
it is no longer matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true of pure medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger from other injuries though a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd holds 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere for his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 out of Arsen@@ y 157 league games in the past five times .
the spread picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight times of play since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs were to date most vulner@@ able days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the risk of injuries is ongoing during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you return from a violation , you have a sus@@ cep@@ tible period of time , in which you must strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the type he deserves .
Arsenal begins its champion league season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ ette Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea in Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday evening , and Wen@@ ger presents himself one rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not joining in Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players you need to treat a little break @-@ off . &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although they are clear favour@@ ites to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing fields with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten in 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday night and was measured at the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
turning to the fact that Arsenal had drawn the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco with his management , lead the association to his first European championship triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked out with arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand , I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we &apos;re not a dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ ly Fest : the Com@@ edy Show , which grants us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to what the need for men to open , now even more desper@@ ate than ever before , how to prove suicide among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains for three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ meister ( CA@@ LM , Camp@@ a@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) in 2015 , the aim of putting the culture in question , to seek the men from seeking help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school pupils with depres@@ sive symptoms proved that if the suff@@ erer was a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; that double its chances of recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends use the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication via social media , with its emphasis on style about substance , the in@@ direc@@ t@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has the need to appear strong , vital and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , all on costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner g@@ desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health a lot more profound .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently , money can &apos;t really buy happiness .
the beauty in friends was that this focus was on the head .
every character was defined by his work , but by his personality that sh@@ one through the interaction as friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football gu@@ ins present in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to any case , even if they are often back to exploring completely their feelings .
as a employee of the telephone exchange it declared me : ... &quot; my in@@ cess@@ ation role for people who feel de@@ pressed and compl@@ aining , I really showed me how the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long lasting effects mechanisms .
this clearly shows the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective stat@@ el@@ age status about the phone may also assist people looking at eye moments of desp@@ air , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ly Fest with the celebration of the day completely new , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to powder the Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ dies Cav@@ ani to Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to pass G@@ PS@@ G to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain &apos;s Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French masters to the way , but afterwards they passed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ shot in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Don@@ et@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they are not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there wasn &apos;t a classic target of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics seduc@@ ed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced with his home @-@ team and against the association with which he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to create and rela@@ xes problems , even if there are certain things , which we have to perfect design in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ on returned home in one of three changes to Paris @-@ Team , which was held on the weekend a 2 : 2 draw on their own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was thrown out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing pl@@ unger has been referred to as the man who , as he was taken over to the next stage in Europe , and he pointed to why he ran in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit to gain this stage , entered the field with nine national players on the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle .
but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passing far from Kevin Tra@@ ps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up sometimes , with some mis@@ carriage and bad connections , not least by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not least rolled out in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had put him after the re@@ boot .
despite this , he demonstrated a lot more skill when he brought his players into play , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria was turned into a shooting down which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the poles ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . at He@@ ay@@ er he achieved his sixth season , after Ibra@@ him@@ on had refresh@@ ed up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the skill games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European Champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar in summer 2015
only a few years ago , FC Bayern was just shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , which was at the time of FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner of Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger , two time club champion , two time European champion , two time champion , the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi suggested that he was already standing before the end of the year 2008 before the departure of Barcelona .
&quot; it told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid didn &apos;t do anything at that time , &quot; he tells us nothing . &quot;
and this was also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a quote from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ el@@ ig@@ ger wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi changed
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for that is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça did deal with Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P has told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; with that he swe@@ eps me out . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s Season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ avi .
for Bar@@ ca in the quarter of the Champions League , X@@ avi stood over the whole gap on the lawn , switched on the red no@@ de ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the end of the royal triumph at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the film
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the af@@ ro@@ American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said it is not necessary behind the scenes .
during a result of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actors brown , when this meant the necessity of alternative prospects , in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you &apos;re doing it during the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; secured Dam@@ on .
brown responded , with ins@@ ulting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the members of The Mar@@ tian arose .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production @-@ center Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to educ@@ ate people to think about it - who will be whatever the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line which is beaten by her white p@@ ud@@ der .
the producer of Y@@ . White People set himself up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , social media explo@@ ded over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni op@@ pressed his anger over the clip by writing , &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain it to its diversity - is SO KNOW that it doesn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
the Twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ ets and 4,000 souls since its publication .
Dam@@ ons &apos; comments are coming at a time at the precise back@@ grounds in the media at the top of the social debate .
after te@@ ens Michael Brown who killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement of Black lives killed dozens of skilled workers and authorities to disc@@ rimin@@ ate discrimination against color content .
in February the singer Prince made a recording on the motion during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums quietly &quot; &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums have still no meaning .
more recently , leader of the movement Black lives matches one statement , and in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a H@@ ass @-@ group .
&quot; the &quot; Black lives &quot; network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently announced that Dam@@ on was present on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope , is un@@ clear .

professional sport@@ sc@@ ars and help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero got the first ath@@ lete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million by home .
the competition Show , which had just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants who could finish all the steps of his obstacle course .
during the season final , there were two men , cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final .
the last task was climbing the climbing on a 75 feet long climb@@ s in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time that he finished the first ath@@ lete , which finished the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge for three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the tough fight , still under shock on the profit of the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or got to life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money .
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the Chief Executive Produc@@ er K@@ ent We@@ ed sat with The Hollywood rep@@ orter in order to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , even though he first ended the course , does not get some prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , the one gets the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t believe he swe@@ eps across it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received thousands of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac could have felt the role when they had changed the rolls .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season , fil@@ ming the fil@@ ming in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit tiger loops to Minnesota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once you &apos;ve been one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger stands on the last place in the American League Central .
the tiger are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part in Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins already reported a chance for Ascension in a home half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card place .
for Detroit , though only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to gras@@ p on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; Tiger Manager Brad P@@ mus said .
tiger pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held its early offensive support , when Detroit stopped three times in the first two inside , then once again in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside and made it possible for three branches .
it was only his third succ@@ es@@ ful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ se@@ ye any game , and therefore I just want to go into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ minute game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has just cur@@ s@@ ited the impact , &quot; said Aus@@ mus .
he looked good out of the ( brass training ) , looked clearly better from the Bull@@ pen and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in meeting at the end of the seventh month , T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colourful , and Simon brought his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed over the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated Roo@@ kie @-@ Schlag@@ er Miguel S@@ ano , who is the right @-@ handed tri@@ mmer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of trucks and the finishing @-@ run in the second , Ver@@ hagen got the third bas@@ king Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play .
it was the major league for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe spread a double play .
after Detroit added to the bottom of the ninth inside , a Insurance Run was added to the wall of R@@ BI against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ anders , however , S@@ ano out at three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
in Detroit , Detroit benefited the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the handed ring veter@@ an who had been cancelled due to the game of the vulner@@ abilities which had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I had wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt better than I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off batt@@ al@@ ers , H@@ airy returned to the second floor with second bass player Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play the single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third b@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os went with a single on the right side , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the tig@@ ers laid in the second , generated a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to match 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins &apos;s manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he has not worked very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the relie@@ ver h@@ anders A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
for Hu@@ gh@@ es three R@@ uns come with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal San@@ chez was eliminated because of a violation of the puppies .
he was studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ chez shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability of the vulner@@ ability , is scheduled for launch on Wednesday .
at San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is deleted from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four Star@@ ts with the tiger , since he was purchased with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he has been missed on the right on 20 August due to a broken in the right hip .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target field on Wednesday .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for one way .
&quot; I think the most deci@@ de@@ dly thinking about military action options cannot be held without Germany , &quot; he said .
he designed the European states &quot; collective attention . &quot;
four years ago I was glad that the cup of military involvement has passed in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict erup@@ ts in front of our door , &quot; he told in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk .

Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria once again introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister Jo@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , but now no one was sent back to Hungary .
Germany , too , has not returned to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she explained .
according to an agreement , according to Germany , a certain number of refugees from Austria could record a certain amount of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , I have already given up talks between the Director General of Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ aries in Germany .

Germany started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
the EU states have not yet to have a common action in the crisis so far .
the EU interior ministers must take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) for a special attack on the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting .
given the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries with the first intake and distribution of people .
together with some four @-@ hour consultations with the Presi@@ dents of the German chan@@ cell@@ or in Berlin , the Federal Government will call this agreement together with the countries for lack of four hours .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who ro@@ ar protection , they show this too .
but who wasn &apos;t a lead @-@ perspective , can also not remain in Germany .
this view was expressed in the turn .
the Chancellor , the state as a whole , emphas@@ ized a &quot; huge effort of force . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees stuck to the Bal@@ kan@@ track meanwhile .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometers border with Serbia at night on Tuesday .

these include researchers of sight@@ ings of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
accordingly , the moon passes by the ring on its orbit around the ring .
this do@@ cking movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous sky@@ coat , it says in a communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the paper &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for longer it was known that there must be superf@@ lu@@ ous water under the ice cap of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to respect his slender line will rather be broken by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
healthy are the exotic fruit nevertheless : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. mainly contain man@@ gos but lots of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor to beta car@@ otene .

on the purchase , man@@ gos should not be too soft or firm to smell .
the shell @-@ color alone says nothing about it , how ripe the fruit is - so can also taste green man@@ gos very tasty .

on Wednesday and in the night , the F@@ öhn blo@@ ws partly with storm @-@ thickness through the open valleys .
according to F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a prominent cold front that brings strong rain falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther site
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther position .
in the presence of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a previously unknown destination in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill has been baptized in the name of the German Re@@ forms .
at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now commem@@ orated as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is right in the heart of Rome right next to the Colos@@ seum .
the name was requested by the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Lutheran Church in Rome , re@@ minded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the town of the Pop@@ es could often live by centuries as a minority .
with the square it becomes visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) gave birth to a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 , some months in Rome .
he found the city back then , as a fall &apos;s fall @-@ up .
his negative impressions might prove him by histor@@ ians in his later battle against Rome .
Luther continued with his thes@@ es against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del the split of the end@@ ental church .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his entire Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible tex@@ tures .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now been published with magnificent pictures .
in the beginning the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 mot@@ if@@ s .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and fan@@ ciful forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no matter is syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the respective topics adapted , that can quite be quite a bit glo@@ omy .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he met a sub@@ jec@@ tively artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot;
there are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as cross and cross , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood .
as a spont@@ ane@@ ously , he is fascinated by several partners : this also applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has set up on the basis of painting with the respective Bible places .
it has interpreted the Scri@@ ptures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus even today , into current relationships . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
nestled among Martin Luther &apos;s original Bible Studies , they are embedded in a proposition by the artist who form@@ ulated his personal thoughts of the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden lamps .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has twice a deep insight into his soul and emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
the trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family , who heard the most severe Protestant Christian Order .
&quot; since the education came up with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members .
&quot; I have attempted to re@@ comp@@ ense this , perhaps to sl@@ ay me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in faster time to more places : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery today is influenced by an advertisement , and that is noisy .
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have some hidden world@@ ly and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall in the pictures , &quot; let them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost founded on Tuesday in the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Arts : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends with his paintings . &quot;
old have not considered to be fully taken from the Bible , but rather selected for him , including myst@@ ical themes .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; click here to explain the images , the text is explained , &quot; I had created a copy of the Bible .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented at an exhibition for the first time at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction of the construction for BM@@ X
plans were made , company was commissioned to model company hop around a round course : one year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was over again .
they did not endure bar@@ gain in politics and management , especially in the ro@@ omm@@ ates , who did not toler@@ ate the railway .
Thus hill above , new place sought - now with formal planning and motion on building permit .
the permit will be booked in October , the First congregation of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to express its youth and youth affairs .
&quot; I hope that this year something is very visible , &quot; she said .
it should then be without &quot; further memorial @-@ pause &quot; with the work begun at the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees up to 2019 , and the Bundesliga a significant mark on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the acting situation in Germany and sec@@ ures his help in dealing with the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ union . &quot;
&quot; in principle nobody can say that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in every single person to get this topic in the gras@@ p , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the situation in Germany inten@@ sively .
&quot; I joined the Chancellor &apos;s office in the next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State of Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ uz and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
football can and wants to help .
the decisive course has to place politics .
the German football league thus extended its refugee policy &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung we ensured that this programme goes on until 2019 , &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach commented on the outskirts of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
even some German lig@@ ists support this program .
already on this weekend , 36 Pro@@ fi@@ des are compar@@ ing a significant sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the otherwise common sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) that we can help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama continues on any one , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can be a soccer team , no , we have to use our brilli@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly well to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
as for the Euro @-@ qualifying game against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
to realize that all 36 license plates had started their own projects , were magnificent .
it is also great that small and smallest publishers are involved .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; which we spent is going to be in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year and next year , the association will also provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; ren@@ ders have already retri@@ eved all the sum for 2015 , &quot; Call@@ s@@ bach reported .
reports : S &amp; D Bureau lost an eye on accident
the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye through a fall in early July .
in the accident at the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight which he carried into the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed up , was f@@ ainted , then he dra@@ gged out on the road - that &apos;s how he told us this last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &apos;s SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Chairman of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old managers were unemployed at the meeting and &quot; full of labour . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Donn@@ el@@ ag@@ s@@ sler ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software platforms .
&quot; I &apos;m fully equipped for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I understood the full time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
let him go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen to anyone . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stay up again if you like . &quot;

the national player will also play the soccer leader in the football league in the Du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we can &apos;t look back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday .
whether R@@ EU@@ s will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen the Bv@@ Q @-@ coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his ancest@@ ral eleven position at the R@@ EU@@ s position .
thus he announced a shift on the por@@ ridge position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of stem art@@ works Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer instructor praised the World Champion .
however , whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ chel has left to be open .
with high probability he will also deny the second game .
the ongoing statement by Mit@@ sui R@@ EU@@ s , that the final decision for the Bv@@ C in the Europe League will be the goal , with@@ stands mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l : &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to retri@@ eve the title . &quot;
Robotics Car : government wants to lead back to Germany
in Germany , according to the will of the federal government , Germany should be a pioneer in the vehicle technology .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse International Motor Show .
the automated and networked driving will increase road safety and take less stress , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ parts from the G7 states , who at the IAA coming together with representatives from the industry .
the Strateg@@ ic Paper of the Department of Transport emphas@@ izes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a quick access to digital radio stations .
at the time of testing new technology , a test track takes place on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
to allow the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to new developments . &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use about internationally that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
moreover , the Federal Government will also stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the man as driver .
in automated driving the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras which process the environment and process data in a matter of seconds .
following a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
nevertheless , vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected far from 2020 . &quot;
the value added value in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving capabilities on site in Germany estimate the study from the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ traffic sp@@ ol@@ iti@@ ker S@@ ören Bart@@ ol .
but the question of liability for accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans are still looking sk@@ ep@@ tic cars - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA @-@ based survey of the For@@ sa Institute in the order of investig@@ ators DE@@ K@@ RA is coming to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars are going through in the next ten years , 32 percent expect only 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of respon@@ dents were charged by aut@@ on@@ ome cars , 33 per cent until 2025 .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not willing to leave himself completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to reduce control during the whole passage on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic noise could at least 15 percent , while the traffic could reach 45 percent .
good everyone justified the car under no circumstances .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figures @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which look temper@@ ed by video projec@@ tions .
they carry the spectacular creations from the French designer , amongst others with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits for the great star of fashion scene - and with that he was put men into skirts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant out of Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier , it was ble@@ ak , in the meantime , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from the 18th of September to the Kunsth@@ alle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designers has changed its position at a show about his person .
actually he would have been , for : &quot; for me an exhibition was a little bit after death , &quot; he said .
when you die , one comes into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ t .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into that &apos;s barely out@@ dated work of man , which has written fashion history without ever completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artistic work that was powered for a lot of effort : to fr@@ at@@ ise the dolls , for example , a styl@@ ist was engaged .
14 tons of material have mo@@ red the makers to according to the ators of Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot after Munich .
shortly before the launch of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather h@@ osen @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gaul@@ tier said .
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers age Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender fashion re@@ try of the designer .
as a kid ( he was not a good pup@@ il and bad in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and dresses , Gaul@@ tier said .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion itself .
he st@@ ole fashion manus@@ cripts and saw the designs of other designers as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later on I bought it , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they did not get anything but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Sp@@ au@@ ding tip as fashion niche
we used to go about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were produced in great amount for customers , which they processed for example cover and she@@ er curtains .
this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , who is the director of the desp@@ air .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early hours of the pl@@ unge , fashion played a larger role , and was then displac@@ ed by the hom@@ textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt is calling several examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and for regional folk costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that re@@ jects an increasing client potential .
those who are not in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
they already make half of the jobs with us .
desp@@ air Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ens and Sti@@ cker together with nine other corpor@@ ations .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
about 80 percent of the sales were broken in the last 15 years .
private technical stores and wholesale are no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer on this path .
in the Asian region nowadays , the bulk goods are sold much cheaper and sells almost exclusively over chains .
export of export , currently under Russia and the USA .
sufficient reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tried to score especially through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula farmer by embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce ecological and soci@@ ally vi@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
Professor in U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger College of the East @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alizing in embroi@@ dery and sp@@ ikes .
in order to oppos@@ e competition from the Asian region , one must find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
this creates a voltage panel between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies , which must remember most economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design can be varied only slightly to keep a customer base .
some years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ inv@@ ests the historical snow sp@@ ike .
the machine runs on some places small ch@@ icks .
the pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ de@@ master in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ se inspired him : &quot; before I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional di@@ pped tip . &quot;
now it uses the snow@@ ball point for their jewelry .
in an elab@@ orate process , it marks the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of pl@@ unge - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers who have lived their ancestors in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding region and who would like to mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the pl@@ au@@ ens head .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; Film

however , according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; it &apos;s not about a new movie but a sort of sequ@@ el to the first film about 20 years after the first film .

EU wants to double the mer@@ cury limit in prey
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the threshold for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus sei@@ ze a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the Consumer Organisation , F@@ ood@@ watch , is responsible for the EU &apos;s Consumer Policy : &quot; risks and side effects of lack of industrial and environmental policy were passed with full force of weaker and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is estimated to increase the limit values of the nerve for large fish at the end of the food chain like shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , &quot; equivalent to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury , per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large rob@@ ber@@ fishes , however , are so strong with mer@@ cury that are not sold in the basis of the still valid limit values about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
in return for this sl@@ ush the EU wants to er@@ adi@@ c@@ ate the threshold values at other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ ns are usually so low stressed that they already have to hold the suggested maximum values today .
the ab@@ dic@@ ation in g@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de det@@ ailing which helps alone the economy , &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
Mercury is a heavy metal alloy , which is rich in food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the federal government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; already small amounts of damage could cause damage to the nervous system .
the Federal Environment Ministry expresses its homepage in terms of current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population could not be expected .
Mercury is mainly transported by coal burning into the environment .
according to a written agreement by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the German coal fired power station Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in Germany last year , em@@ itted by two thirds of the total volume generated in Germany .
the concentrations of mer@@ cury in fishing in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube can be &quot; permanent and nation@@ wide &quot; when the &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; was quoted from the paper in March .
last year , a lot of mer@@ cury in fish already counted among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ SF@@ F .
