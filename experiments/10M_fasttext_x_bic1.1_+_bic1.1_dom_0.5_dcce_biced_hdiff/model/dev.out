it was also remarkable for personal reasons .

UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an Ki @-@ Moon says , his answer to Russia &apos;s military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of conflict , and more weapons will only get violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN boss calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to prevent and integral negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday , that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the edge of the Ministers of the General Assembly , in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ ts that the insur@@ ers in the Council and the Syrian people , and the regional powers &quot; this situation is in@@ soluble . &quot;

8 conversion values , show that Donald Tr@@ ump seriously is seriously .
some have tried to treat him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges at the bottom , it has not working ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in two @-@ digit area , and some begin to ask for the chances of the nom@@ ination of real estate ads .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
none claims that tr@@ ump probably win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts bet@@ ting that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was submitted to the increasing Herman , which is not only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice .
but outer side groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ es Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps and begin to leave their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current conversion values that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump his candidate was born in mid @-@ June , showed a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University that just saw two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ s the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul .
until mid July there were 40 percent .
in early August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ s have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; happy &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 say , they would be , &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm like Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would be .
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is critic@@ ised for his bomb and besie@@ ged statements , that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is the right temperature for a President , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered to think the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a tor@@ ch , but according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent that he doesn &apos;t have the personality to run effective office , and almost six of 10 ounces say that his temperature is not the White House pas@@ se , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters get to the idea .
when they set their schol@@ ars , rep@@ ubli@@ can hold tr@@ ump tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CNN / OR@@ C from the last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time , when four of the end of July you put money to Je@@ b Bush .
full disclos@@ ure : GO@@ P voters had not in the past not the clear crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination would only be 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters will see tr@@ umps campaign as a plau@@ sible .
even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans collect a different candidates , Tr@@ ump strikes almost every one .
some experts indicate that the broken field is likely to join Tr@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates diff@@ us .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University of September shows that in a hypo@@ thesis head @-@ on @-@ head race between tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the multi @-@ lasting support .
in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Walker Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eurs with 19 points in an independent head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a cr@@ ush majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a bit more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have awarded their voices .
of course , a lot of course can be done to change that and no one can really say , never the opinion .
46 percent said that they are open to the door to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the strongest competition at the moment of other outside side , the Neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ urg Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have formed their opinion , are twice as often for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign were called &quot; rape &quot; from Mexico &quot; rape &quot; was the Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ s in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ ular pressure of Tr@@ ump crucial H@@ isp@@ ano Americans will hold the Republi@@ can party from the Republi@@ can party and the new oriented efforts will be damaged .
but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
as long as the immigration remains in the ramp , the Donald Tr@@ ump will also do .
fru@@ stration on the government has climbed up to new maximum conditions .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters , especially by their outer lateral status .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political outer side as someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington .
a survey of the Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ s shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ can be fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive accommodation in Germany
here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residence - overlooking the North se@@ ew@@ att .
in the road , a square meter is a square meter at the average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects are limited according to objects , it means it in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which special layers is a square meter on most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top rooms , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ er@@ ical prices in sh@@ wind@@ y heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meters , well noticed .
but good who can afford it ...

they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shiny .
Piraeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal groups , among them against nam@@ ing clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next sacrifice .
they went brave , with their obvious efforts , but often to work .
the attacks were often led by play on Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , who was rarely crossed against the former Braun@@ er Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had left more happiness than his flan@@ k from the right half field in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , as the Olympic ak@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown the head ball of Poland ( 26 ) .
then be sent by direct , the Tor@@ am Roberto with the knees ( 3@@ 5th ) .
even though the Bavaria came to domin@@ ating the game of Bavaria , Piraeus could put Piraeus .
but the Manuel New was found on Tor@@ at@@ ter Manuel New .
so about when he had a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of New Zealand Gu@@ ardi@@ ola , a quadru@@ erk@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat outside .
the World Cup hero was given only after the final training of green light , the sport stood Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to do something else , that is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the an@@ ta@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything is clear by El@@ f@@ meters .
before the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ all .
after a smaller group of fixed Bavaria @-@ fans obviously the followers of hosts Piraeus , with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces of security forces and went with impact on the Munich trailer .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who rough , has a higher risk , teeth to lose teeth
those who smoke , that is not only the lungs , but also the teeth - it lays a long @-@ term study near .
the good news : this is the risk quickly .
smoking have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
that goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking , the risk to lose their teeth , to lose up the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ Fa@@ che .
scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes for denti@@ sts be c@@ aries and inflammation of dental flesh , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Fra@@ gest@@ ion of the Prime Minister
since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns is expected at the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour Chairman Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should be his debut at the Fra@@ gest@@ ion of the Prime Minister , and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to take the first of his six pre @-@ given questions shortly after lunch , with its performance from the media probably and the Labour Party from the vicinity .
he called &quot; less Theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because she comes to his appointment for the member of the Sch@@ att@@ itudes and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the Sin@@ gens of the National District , at the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the centre of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not to sing the National Park , has attention attention .
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &quot; he had stood &quot; in respec@@ t@@ ful silence , &quot; and he had recognized the &quot; Hel@@ icop@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the air of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour chairman , &quot; regardless of his faith , &quot; regardless of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top team , and they called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six st@@ el of the parliamentary party was originally supported as leader .
the Political correspondence of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within the Labour &quot; st@@ ack@@ ers &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns on position to the European Union and the limit .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference to remove Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limit .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work and R@@ ent Minister that the party &quot; is very clear &quot; that they may only be able to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ .000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour president , David Cameron , since he has lived in the last decade over the D@@ isp@@ atch box in Parliament .
the Labour Chairman , who has promised another politicians , says that he had given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the quest@@ ionn@@ aires of the Prime Minister is under@@ lined , and that it is made with contra@@ sts , and that it is made possible to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic Minister is represented by him - for example , when Mr. Cameron takes place abroad .
he also brought the idea to talk to the talk , and that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he was John Ber@@ sts , the spokes@@ man of the sub@@ house , and I have given the problem .
when he was born in 2005 , Mr Cameron , that he was removed from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre , which is often associated with the quest@@ ionn@@ aires of the Prime Minister . but some years later , he found it in it .
since it was first sent to TV in 1990 , the quest@@ ionn@@ aires has been sent to the Prime Minister as an important bar@@ ometer of the decision and his leadership in the sub@@ house and its position under his parliamentary place , although critics have been thought to become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require a significant reforms .

inspired by the &quot; potato &quot; potato instead , &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat was put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .

only so much : &quot; it tastes better , &quot; he finds .

Met@@ cash starts soil campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect IG@@ A @-@ branches before a Al@@ di @-@ up in South Australia and Western Australia .
food@@ stu@@ ffs Met@@ cash has started a soil campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia to defend a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of the next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IG@@ A by Ma@@ instream marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , which sell in IG@@ A stores and Lad@@ ders , which sell tickets for the South Australian soccer liga to faithful customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash further details of its defense strategy will be published on 29 September , when the Grand Prix of food , alcohol and devices will lead its annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia is nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs IG@@ A @-@ Lad@@ en@@ ings and higher winning mar@@ gins as Met@@ cas@@ hs IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia have a much more powerful market share as in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries will take away and all existing ac@@ ulate , but mainly self @-@ permanent sales sales will take away .
according to this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley , that IG@@ A @-@ retailers can lose 360 $ million per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ until the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the acceptance that Al@@ di is opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market .
the loss of loss and grocery store and in the amounts of met@@ cas@@ ens high fixation base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market share in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently led survey of Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A purchases .
Morgan Stanley takes part in the market and grocery store around 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4,@@ 1 percent in the year 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will reduce the market share of 14 percent to 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business eat in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week contact .
IG@@ As market share has risen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and made from Met@@ cas@@ ks and food trading , which has increased by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in equal pressure on sales and mar@@ gen .
however , more than 150 million $ , in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ ks at hundreds of products each week and IG@@ A @-@ retailers in the improvement of their shops to improve fresh foods and a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ hs main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price is custom@@ iz@@ ations and shop @-@ San@@ ier@@ programs to Elan are and hopes to return the Grand Prix in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis court Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise as criticism for its behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; Kol@@ lateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis court Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , which is becoming more than &quot; Special KS &quot; is called by the not@@ orious conflict with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison soon had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ ration , and Harrison , called Harrison : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to beat , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last recently seen a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ ates a potential US @-@ open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup half final against Britain .
&quot; one thing that I was quite er@@ ei@@ ves , the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was a little in the battle , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
he was broken , when he lost a bat in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket out of Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but in the US Open , he really loved himself in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think that he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around , he has a great family around himself , and I believe that he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very rei@@ fer 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the form of the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged after his own contra@@ sts .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take an important decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but to return the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is focused on the competition , and not all the contro@@ vers@@ aries around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick very quickly made the Ascension , but we will try to support him in the sight of the public , but we will try to consider him the consequences of his trade . some time outside of the ramp , but it is best for reasonable , and it is best for the crew and it is the best for him .

election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ differently in national survey
the former U.S. Federal Minister Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to continue a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie wins her opposite the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is on second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not been announced if he receives the Presi@@ dency of the presidential elections , the support of 15 percent of the democratic voters .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , the most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is standing , which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ ics support are in their choice as those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey has lost Clinton at a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while sigh@@ ted some profits .
Clinton holds a great lead in women and mixture , but these pre@@ dat@@ ors have reduced .
their support in men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is back here with 5 points .
Clin@@ ics benefit at democratic voters under 50 years under 50 years , and they are now on the same height .
Clinton has still has a great lead to the older voters .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit lead to the Liber@@ als , but S@@ different has now a 5 @-@ point lead to this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the elections , that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if they would be nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some pre @-@ keep and further 15 percent , they would only support them because she is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ ics are current support of all of you are thrilled .
the views are stronger with those who currently not support Clinton - just about one quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters about their nick@@ an@@ di@@ di@@ data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ ics support in an open question , why they want to know that she is the most common experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clin@@ ics support , their connection is mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and voters are also cited .
since the vice @-@ president is a potential for the presidential office in the orph@@ ans , would like to see 57 percent of democratic voters in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
when democratic voters will be asked for the party , who would be their second choice , is Bi@@ den at the top .
by Clin@@ ics , more than half that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far from S@@ different .
decides Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ cr@@ ates , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics increases lead to 30 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters will see Clinton as a candidate in with the best chances to win the choice ; however , this number of 78 per cent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is a second on this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ bar@@ sten &quot; is increased .
nevertheless , in the question , what is important for a candidate , the Democratic voters call questions about the voters .
similar to the last month , there is no single demo@@ cr@@ iti@@ oning candidate or potential candidate for this voters of the elections as in@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results at some important characteristics at voters of their party .
we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and confi@@ dential and trusted with strong guide .
with the three Candi@@ date , Bi@@ den cuts the best from hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is hon@@ estly and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ different ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic voters will see Clinton , S@@ different and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ different .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t will continue using a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term time as the Foreign Minister , most of the elections were satisfied with its declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans now is un@@ happy with its explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y has no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deteri@@ orated .
there are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 that say that their views are worse by Clinton .
although Clinton from the voters of their party as honest and confi@@ dential , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than in May .
62 per cent of the election do not hold them for a honest and confi@@ dential person .
at the same time 55 per cent of the election , Tr@@ ump is also not honest and not trusted .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will receive good notes at guidance .
from the six tested candidates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush at the best of hon@@ esty .
a majority looks rather than honest , but as at Car@@ son many no opinion of him .
the error ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters are 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moved to the next survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatic to stop
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters support many tr@@ ump in large number . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey that was conducted before Fox News debate in the last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sch@@ oss at the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey showed that Car@@ son at demo@@ graphic groups are well @-@ held and Tr@@ ump under rep@@ ubli@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Kas@@ ich , has fallen by Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who has fallen by 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the error mar@@ ge at the sample sample of 3@@ 76 persons by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was performed in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , the last week has been published , shows that Car@@ son rises in the pol@@ ls - he is estimated at 19 % support with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the youngest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly before Car@@ son .
with a look at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found a few side effects for the former neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gen , even after Car@@ son decided to ask faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during an campaigns in I@@ owa .

five members of the Brotherhood with death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student while a student competition in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ cies will be submitted to five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ si @-@ Bru@@ si attacks on Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an entry in September 2013 was brutal and delayed his transport into the hospital , which has contributed to his death .
officials said , he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound backpack full of sand with a 30 @-@ pound backpack full of sand , while he tried to go over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally entered the head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ Brotherhood called not the emergency number 911 to Den@@ g , and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police brought him into a hospital .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ cies ef Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide , and set the good of the Brotherhood in the Brotherhood of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ cies ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning at his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ pressed report Den@@ g were repeated with st@@ ump power injuries to head , hull and upper th@@ igh .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Sch@@ ik@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least a student dies at the Sch@@ ik@@ ans , &quot; Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in a declaration .
Bru@@ der@@ ships and their members must be moved to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe is an indictment for the first five members for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and education of an criminal union .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to be responsible for the participating people , but if there is an organization that has been officially or in@@ officially - this , we will also draw this to account , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has contra@@ cted their access to the city group .
this will happen when the f@@ ed increases the interest
a tick is coming , and the house is going into che@@ ken , R@@ end@@ ites will rise for bonds , and the economy will go into a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will keep it .
especially the story for the economy is only low instructions for the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rates and lasted 86 months .
the aggression of the Federal Reserve of the Federal Reserve is often often , if not always , a factor such as the economy and financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank thus emphas@@ izes that investors should not focus on , when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period which is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end of the market , market share , however , that the whole excitement could possibly be taken over due .
&quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest to normal heights , but still on low level to fear the se@@ is@@ mic shock which seem to be afraid .
however , this does not mean that there is no effect .
here is a historical trends based on historical trends , as some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the pre@@ ference can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l .
as soon as increasing , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that is reflected in monetary policy from 12 to 24 months after the first increase in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study , which is happening in a newer study .
more precise , the market is mostly in the last 35 years ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the route for the past six days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the last six years after a current analysis , the Bob Dol@@ l , chief facility @-@ Str@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will occur later and the return cycle starts to decrease itself .
rec@@ essi@@ ons are a fact of economic life , but c@@ ens@@ ations promote them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not accelerate it before and the recession could accelerate .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to the lowest point of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 Z@@ igh@@ s was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was expected by 3.6 percent , only a few that this is expected and expect for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
in case of such a frag@@ ile economic scenery could be ris@@ ky , and throw the question on , &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market leaders have made up the whole year on a to@@ ast of the f@@ ed , and all eyes were judged on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday .
while many Str@@ ate@@ urs and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could be an increase in this session , there are only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all the Incre@@ ase cycles of 1950 to present in a super cycle with increasing the GDP in a super @-@ cycle with increasing the GDP in the shadow , so quickly after the beginning of the recovery in the shadow , &quot; so the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is far from the longest that has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market is a tick , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares when the strategic course change .
when bonds seem to change the edges of the direction , once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the process cycle the An@@ lei@@ gh fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the Str@@ ate@@ gen from Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead that R@@ end@@ ites will lead between longer and shorter bonds closer to the curve .
highly competitive bonds often bring much better results in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher levels , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analysts in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting , Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some signs that the market has been adapted to the view of more difficult monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates are fl@@ acher , credit card has risen and the Vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all features of the market , when the F@@ ed their strategy has increased its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that make the larger part of their business activity in the USA , benefit from interest rates and local products are attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts are worse , as a rising of dollars will make their products on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality - &quot; shares tend to respond to three months after a initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customer .
companies with strong balance sheet company with a strong balance sheet in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 an average of 5 percentage points exceeded .
companies with high capital R@@ end@@ ites as well as lower Vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also met with lower quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose , he said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollars .
austerity could see profits by higher income , even if experts are different opinion , as quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says the member of Andrew B@@ ingham

he also aims at the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started in the past year , the Br@@ its seem to be under another name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually have only the im@@ itate which is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director reported that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and re@@ jection of the public .

at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to engage in the past , when it did in the past , because the British did less than classical music .

he added , he wish that the company will find a hit from our house &apos;s own stable , &quot; if it &apos;s the next time a entertainment series .

the sports function@@ alities could have been active and invested the sports club for which they had been working in the debt of 1982 until 2011 and has invested some time and money from the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va was invested in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44@@ ,000 euros ) .

&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
he knew not the answer .

if something happened , no one would have to know something of this money , presented the prosec@@ utor in the space .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play monthly due to double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w fell by the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven , a double fra@@ cture of his right B@@ one .
while this left the left outside wines brought him for at least six months from games , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the violation was caused by a refundable attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was built in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field field and needed oxygen before he was brought into hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bass and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United Kingdom , it is very difficult and then it happens .
in the outer cabin he had a oxygen mas@@ ke .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and escape of a El@@ f@@ th escape .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ ration , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ect that the Italian arbit@@ ration had s@@ laugh@@ tered .

it was a very worse attack with both legs .

if a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all very sad .
it is never the intention of our player , a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg , as Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to bear the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see , the ball was in another direction , so that he had touched him as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like it can be so difficult .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry .

surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better knows better ?
it is a thing to learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of children &apos;s care systems , his favorite child @-@ book , decided to call the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was the Prime Minister of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I would like to give my children , because it seems to have a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph describes the action of the book , instead of 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the new characters and details .
&quot; in the midst of the surrounding town of Th@@ y @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone to see a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to see her desire to see a real tree , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss host@@ el and the 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this is not the non @-@ suspected text , the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie will be presented as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is artificial and even the air is to win a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although it seems to be a prag@@ matic Father , it seems unlikely that Cameron does the action of the book so little familiar , like the local environment , as the local environment , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; that is wounded in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely was such a relatively low PR task to an hel@@ pers , which The Lor@@ ax is not read 20 times in a single child .
a Down@@ ing Street Spe@@ ak , said that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons election office .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees , but there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England team , but it &apos;s still difficult
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if one has chosen the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series not on my card .
I would not close an error victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks page is possibly less than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry the sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size to test level , is an option for the attack .
this post @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th is made from the England Test Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is of course for me as his head trainer in Yorkshire , hard to analyse .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ters are focused on results .
there were no question for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this , players said to their own best extin@@ ction .
long ago , one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he went out more lungs for Yorkshire , a further chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor of Bay@@ l@@ iss lob@@ te his attitude , even if he was not so good services , and the surprised me not ; it is especially a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test impact will receive to set his sign , is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine got nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to travel and play .
the only incident that you can rise in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is an impact man that I have high .
he is a X factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw in Yorkshire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which was very met .
he must receive at least the same chances as before him , but this depends on the United Arab Emirates in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , Mo@@ een next to Cook beat out what an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qu@@ icks would receive , and I have nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why an impact man could not beat there , and this left has already shown that he is a devil player from cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een may not be done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team had Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he made three hundred R@@ us immediately and did not go back .
Z@@ ho@@ Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may be able to see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball and think , there is a Pun@@ ching , but there is no great number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who decided their hands and the coach have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew England , England has made a few wise additions at the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master .
he is one of the n@@ ett@@ est candle of the game that will bring a abundance of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he is created for international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and how Mah@@ ela he can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in harmony with the previously appeared .
Col@@ l@@ ys team@@ collective at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used for a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team@@ work does not determine the schedule .
and you have to think that as with players their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not hit light heart .
the Bre@@ xit warehouse ( Bre@@ xit = Aus@@ rose Great Britain from the EU ) could win , when the economy could win up to 2017 in a flame device
David Camer@@ ons un@@ noticed new hand @-@ hand strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour or the TU@@ C , which is broken down because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ acy and said new member states that some member states is so deeply rooted in different crises , as the EU is now and not always from own fault , Great Britain , and not always out of their own guilt , which they are mostly not want to do .
in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it is also not like the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Financial Minister will climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign main cities , make a photo of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European friend who wishes to go outside the Great Britain within the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can be seen that more and more short and more short minister and officials come up to the point that we are no matter whether we remain or go .
in Germany , Germany , Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has left the office before it has been bad for it as it has been bad for it as it is bad for it as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande looks back to his re@@ election or en@@ forcement in 2017 .
he is also a verbal force .
Poland may soon be a national rights government , Spain has a left .

experts critical report by Public Health England via E @-@ cigarettes
claims of a nation@@ alized agency that e @-@ cigarettes less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , founded in Lanc@@ et by using the Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes used .
P@@ he published the &quot; primary report &quot; in the past month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have asked the load of data in@@ quire and asked to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a Editorial in the medical specialist magazine Lanc@@ et last month the &quot; extremely tiny basis , &quot; on the P@@ he founded his most important conclusions .
two further researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Public Health at the London School of hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public is expected that the present is expected that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of the neighbour and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people to develop a model for a multi @-@ specific criteria @-@ decision analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ted products ; the results of the meeting were involved in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO previously received from British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated on the meeting , means of an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he received from the Tab@@ ac@@ companies Philip Morris International , they added to reports before the Tab@@ ac@@ companies Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but includes several known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , which also includes several known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , of which some of them also specify an economic financing in paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the session also the tobacco line of P@@ he participated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , no of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there are no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and well @-@ being in P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J has already been re@@ acts before .
he said : &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life of life dies on his Su@@ cht .
all evidence close to that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study the long term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to the public of the public about what is the proof and what is not , especially when there is much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs two billion £ per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of poll@@ ut@@ ants , which is caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should come to East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said , the BBC should stop programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that will not be sent through other UK transmitter .
it critical to the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programmes that probably can be seen by a smaller audience , which are likely to place during a smaller audience , in hard to place their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ators such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried six years in his time with Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are in order or send that the BBC programs would be shown in order , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the circular charge , what I do or long term for a good idea , you should not make its production at least on programs that do not make any other or in order .
please send the Voice in a first class window because they want to achieve a wide range of wide support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is naturally non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why an reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs , which could also be financed without sub@@ ventions .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , used both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I &apos;m going to see how it should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to work for the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments to the most popular shows of the BBC , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 should go to BB@@ C4 , but they can argue their tasks , and they can argue , &quot; now , of course , we have created all these ob@@ serving programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see .
to the radio fee , Johnson said : &quot; I need to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value .
of course , remember all that one gets for 150 £ per year here , but for people who is for 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether it is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called the BBC their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to inform and talk . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio and Canada , it should change this in &quot; inform , clari@@ fy and talk . &quot;
for the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only one hand@@ ful in television will be shown and will be able to make everything available online .
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ den will change the direction in the moment , in which they will be broken with sound .
scientists have bred worms with gen@@ ious nerve systems that can be controlled by sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ den change the direction in the moment , in which they have to have a high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard .
the impul@@ ses work through the switch from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the worms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
on Sal@@ k Institute , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure may replace the depths of a day , the electric impul@@ ses in the brain of people to treatment of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
we are usually not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani was fixed that they did so when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles .
the bladder , he found out that the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms .
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves work on structures , the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ channels are called and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves will enable the opening of this I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ channels and activate the cells where they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ gen@@ etic the worms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ channels carry out .
when he had ultrasound to the changing creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ scop@@ es and transferred into the worms , where they switch the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ es , a separate tool that allows scientists to turn neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and turn off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages to this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , you can pass low frequency ultrasound tissue fat and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with Gen@@ therapy and therapeutic virus it is possible to make human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal to make certain neurolog@@ ical treatments for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin production cells , added to muscle cells .

eight golden rules for life in student homes
before eleven years ago I moved to a student at Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but now I remember the an@@ gled smile on Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but now I remember the an@@ gled smile of those who I have led - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints over others .
most of what I learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the suit in student &apos;s student is enough of easy @-@ up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ immer@@ ing : people tell you if you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you are &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love , because in Ernst , guys , it is only a He@@ fe@@ extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe out through .
and help others to do the same - do you ask questions and show interest .
the conversation and helps you to find people who like in contrast to those who would not speak if you would not speak , even if your eyelashes would be in fire .
leave people .
the rooms of people can transform themselves in beverages , film @-@ night events and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people spread themselves and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
here : do not think about the Uni with a relationship with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a Refu@@ gi@@ um , but many student houses form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture , which can lead friendly and soci@@ ally for life friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I will go to you that our friendship will go back , so that I have to get the energy for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

homemade le@@ ys offer is a good way to close friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to talk , and will end your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly miss cl@@ ump@@ y from flour , sugar and fat that people feel sleeping , if you go .
food to steal , is a common crime in student homes .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea ?
check that with the dairy owners .
the chances are good that they say to operate themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if any of your things make your things , and you have my compassion - but try to go to be balanced as my ro@@ omm@@ ate , who added their milk , and added to be thief .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , the people of sleep or from work .
it is not only therefore to be a decent man , but that you belong in the true sense of the prover@@ b , which are sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something out , drum &amp; bass somewhat le@@ iser , because there was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test .
they re@@ acted on it with another music .
when she finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours to sleep in two hours before they had her own music pl@@ ung@@ ed her door , and went to her dre@@ aming examination .
would it not be romantic , if your future sp@@ ouse would be random randomly in the same student home ?
in the vice versa , it would not be dis@@ appo@@ inting when you want to see a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ art@@ ner@@ gies , and they will see and let them see every day , and perhaps you will see all the common friends yet ?
of course , the heart of his own ways - but if a hot co @-@ lives definitely does not work your future sp@@ art@@ ner@@ in , try at least , try to talk a little failure .
in the exciting moment , in which you can notice his keys in his not included room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ bing , as it seems .

share a valuable and am@@ eless lesson on safety - but don &apos;t get any one of the room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
complete their door , and put their keys into a glass of water , which you then put their owners in the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ers do not have their owners at the ceiling no more than twice .
Rei@@ h@@ enh@@ ancements for refugees , all@@ or@@ ating , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ er
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds a lot of money for people who have not have a lot of money .
so for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother &apos;s mother and the barley . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build and well @-@ build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview
thousands of refugees will return on the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly cheaper living room can be created : he builds in a project for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will go on the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the most common accommodation in containers or gym has no sustainability .
for people remain at a large part here .
in the next decades , we need enough living space in the next decades .
a very ban@@ ales , dre@@ ig@@ esch@@ os@@ cope house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a row house needs at least one place .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different when you get the people in residence .
each of the six houses , which are built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge room .
it may be that many refugees will say , it is back peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt after the respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters per house is based on 184 000 euros , without plot .
this is over@@ look .
the building takes six months .
this is reasonable .
have the building regulations their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : construction legally established my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worth special construction and the positions .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities are missing in the cities .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the address re@@ acts on your house @-@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there was which they have thrown me , luxury built for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but don &apos;t forget the competitors to pay for paid apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true : we had a building boom in Germany but built in the last five years , but there were luxury apartments who can hardly afford a more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the mother &apos;s mother or the barley .
I show how to build even more convenient and well @-@ build today .
that &apos;s why it goes .

&quot; we always had in the rear head that the garbage ers would fit well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ev@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was as far as I was simply called it . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate in As@@ endorf to operate its own practice .

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls also close to our southern border , &quot; said the Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Colum@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border will remain in parallel .
after how it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum entry , this is also &quot; of course . &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the foreground .
but clearly , &quot; that it is clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people must know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less mig@@ rant currents , also not about the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia er@@ ted &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously told , also Slovenia wool to leave refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under circumstances also the cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this was so the inner Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors be &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external limit of the Schengen area .
like the Minist@@ ries , Slovenia wants to go to its limits for refugees , but not a abri@@ an .
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system does not work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
like the Croatian Government , the first refugees had already tried to go into the night hours to Tuesday , in Eastern Europe at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id over to travel to the registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the near maize fields .
according to local media since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has been constantly growing police vehicles with new refugees .
it is predominantly around Sy@@ rer and Afghanistan , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , the Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ on@@ ically @-@ Serbian border , which had been brought to the Hungarian border to the Hungarian border , the Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
however , the government in Belgrade , however , that it may be wise to beat certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , there is a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border of S@@ id , in the course of the day , more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the grounds were the whole night from around 500 kilometres away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria continues to travel to Germany .
in fact , it could now be used by observ@@ ations in Turkey from the previous Balkans route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Serbia to a bit further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options to limit control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ izes that his country for the case of a strong state of refugees have prepared appropriate plans for possible extin@@ ction .
details called he not , but he proved that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive options to the limit control . &quot;
you lead str@@ ingent controls through to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
in 2007 , Slovenia belongs to the country since 2007 , the EU partners represent a good witness , which affects the standard of the border .
on Serbian side there are about 300 refugees in the Hungarian border .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had the previous night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to continue completely locked .
if the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stefan@@ ovic tried to calm early early early early morning at Hor@@ gos : he keep the debates about alternative rou@@ ts of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed , for the past .
it would not be about very high refugee numbers .
you can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers rates migrants - dangerous - Alternative rou@@ gh@@ ten
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute the refugees , on which alternative routes are characterized by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not un@@ dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police was known that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

not everyone on the boards publicly tell , but it is under@@ stand@@ able to make it a very personal matter .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , business outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter of the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ gigs on a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his Bod@@ transport service .
the company said that she plans to take about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for vacation .
at this time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year to earn 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower views occurs in spite of the price increases , the average of 4.@@ 9 percent and on 4 January and on 4 January , and in spite of the higher condition of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November 4 .
the company said that it is still waiting that the earnings compared to the previous year due to cost savings , higher revenue and growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; solid funds brings more than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holidays employment were announced a day later than the ri@@ val UPS that plans , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has increased a decline in the past few years , which brought sales in its unit Express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the Express unit generated higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0.15 $ .
on Tuesday , they took 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June .
on the most expected meeting in the years of the Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table sitting in order to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade of the Leit@@ z@@ ins .
dro@@ pping over them at an end of the en@@ lighten@@ ed seat , a wall of the United States is located in the end of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ mail order from the Congress : maximum of the US employment and prices are stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that it gives an un@@ locked third mand@@ at : financial stability .
and this third Mand@@ ate could be used in a decision that is to be closely linked to it , whether the US economy is ready to be ready for the un@@ preced@@ ented interest rates by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , could have the recent Tur@@ bul@@ ls in the global financial markets , these Vol@@ at@@ il@@ ity could increase in the global financial markets for the federal government and be only around one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing which they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Head of economics at Mak@@ ler@@ ia Sti@@ cks Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase interest rate , the increased un@@ certainty around the global market is enough to wait for the global market . &quot;
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus about what the F@@ ed will do what is un@@ authorized to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently question@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have said a tick of this week .
however , the financial markets are waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an , which is only 30 % chance to increase an increase .
this indicates a decline of the stock market , if the F@@ ed the set is increased , it is that the shr@@ ate@@ eth the blow down by having promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average value around 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed politics set the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Head of Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed the sentences would lift up to this point , &quot; he said .
if they do it , &quot; it would have to make it very far to calm the financial markets , so that they are not in panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an ignition of the financial markets would make the financial markets because they will act the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act .
even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase in a good way to increase the sentence of 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow waste conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in the early summer that she would be necessary in spite of the complaints of Liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to expect an increase of Satan .
although the creation of jobs in August was slow to improve the improvement in the labour market in this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels , which sees the f@@ ed as whole .
pay@@ roll have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation was constantly growing under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative that is the main reason of the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Head of Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ .
but the financial markets at the end of the last month , after China had increased its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell in May to more than 16 % under its highest level , as investors feared that a slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would be the global growth of the Chinese economy .
the market has a bit relaxing in this month , whereby the Dow is now about 10 % under the H@@ och of May .
for the F@@ ed representative influence the market turbul@@ ence , the complex calculation , when you increase the interest rate .
&quot; if the events did not have occurred on financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , she said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US notebook .
now he says that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about the effects on the US economy and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is one of the main lie in the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision .
but in the end effect , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .
the blo@@ b note of the former Colum@@ ni@@ ers Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that F@@ ed its mon@@ et@@ ric expansion &quot; could be turned around the globe around the globe .
in a world , in the markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly expected to monitor the F@@ ed representative , but also with other central banks and experts advise you to receive a better understanding for global economy .
&quot; more art as science &quot; , Zach@@ ary lob@@ ster , Head of global strategy for the business management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey lacquered , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed a story of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements , which is not associated with the economic foundations data . &quot;
lacquered , the leading member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de is responsible for an in@@ scription , z@@ iti@@ ed decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their conduc@@ tors around 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a limited impact on growth in the USA . &quot; he said lacquered .
a year later , the F@@ ed representative of these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis as the Mark@@ tz@@ us@@ al 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England .
the youngest turbine do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act contains still the double mand@@ ate and mentioned not the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe that they should take time .

Brazil &apos;s pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy such as important nutrition during the still time . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted by the presentation of in@@ healthy food .
parent &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies all need to build a powerful immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers grow to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 calories per day .
however , the new research results that a higher cal@@ orie is not the only di@@ abe@@ tic adaptation , the mothers should be able .
a current study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them before the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the Council of Bern@@ berg approved the construction entry for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ acher for solar system .
the plant@@ ations for the long time gym is step forward to step forward : in the recent municipal session , the construction of construction was blessed without great discussions .
previously , the Gre@@ ens had to have a decision on a construction &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; the liberation &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid Beb@@ au@@ ung@@ plan .
at the &quot; exception , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , a &quot; saddle &quot; with non @-@ mit@@ er first and roof was built . &quot;
in the background of planning , the relevant use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; thus we get a wonderful place of South @-@ ach together , &quot; declared mayor Josef St@@ ain@@ berger in the session .
during the liberation &quot; liberation &quot; went to turn the roof of energetic reasons - different from energetic reasons - unlike ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the Beb@@ au@@ ung@@ ing plan for the roof is no longer &quot; exceptions , whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Joint Parliamentary Assembly is usually associated with Liberation contracts .
however , at the gym , however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a pre@@ ze@@ al fall , &quot; so St@@ ou@@ berger .
the gym of the sports centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bern@@ berg .
at costs around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
access will be expected from the school and Bre@@ eding sports promotion .

refugees need accommodations : study warned in front of the apartment
the location on the German apartment market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees are looking for a affordable lead .
pressure on the apartment market is growing .
the social housing is in front of a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German apartment market has long ago .
with the upcoming refugees and unemployed from the EU will always get more people on a market that is now over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with income weak citizens around the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for paid apartments , have to be built up to 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
this result is a study in the order of the associations &quot; Social housing . &quot;
compared to comparison : in this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished .
therefore 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are not obliged to live after the first three months of their stay , as asylum seek@@ ers in a first day accommodation .
many will then go on the apartment market and series in the long serp@@ ents in front of the rental apartments .
according to the Statist@@ ical Federal Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers to rent .
however , the negative development of the apartment market is not only one of the increasing refugee numbers .
the study also makes considerable deteri@@ oration in the construction policy of the last years .
Germany is a apartment deficit ahead , which is bigger from year to year .
currently missing in the Ball@@ room areas already around 77@@ 0,000 living units , be@@ ekeeping Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professional activities are therefore in large cities in WG rooms .
young adults remained in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has risen again in the past few years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing &quot; is a re@@ boot .
for this , new inc@@ enti@@ ves should return to the social housing .
thus it could be exposed to the gr@@ um@@ wer@@ ing tax , and the basic tax will be exposed to their dwellings .
according to the alliance attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options are needed .
the funding programme for refugee information of the State Bank ( W comes with cities and communities already now .
a good week after the start was on Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the available are available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be stopped .
refugees have free schol@@ ar : Croatia and Slovenia do a corridor
according to Hungary , practically no more , since then more refugees choose the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces the journey over Slovenia to north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Slovenian inner Minister , and when it is necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports of Croatian television channel RTL .
Hungary had rounded off his border for refugees .
new laws that came into force on the same day , the regular asylum procedure in Hungary is virtually excessive .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; you can travel , and we prepare ourselves on this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
however , people who wanted to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken the first refugees on the border of Ser@@ bi@@ ens to the EU neighboring country in Croatia .
most of the media reports according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with bus as well as Tax@@ es in the Serbian border of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot on the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian Serb border , the refugees will not go to the border .
the border of other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90s .
min@@ ef@@ ields should now quickly create a secure passage .
after Hungary , after the closing of the border , the border is hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday , the police rose 3@@ 66 .
shortly before Tor@@ ge on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws levels of over@@ flow and damage to the border of the border .
in the South Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed were therefore 35 criminal procedures .
the condem@@ nation rose up to five years and the farewell from the country .
according to the opening ceremony , one took part in the new on the border &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ons &quot; in a total of 94 asylum applications , almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applic@@ ant , 13 families with young children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there would be 40 refugees there .
however , no one has received no more view to receive asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third party . &quot;
the exp@@ elled asylum seek@@ ers should be stopped at the top .
before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke started working on workers .
they gathered the mos@@ ll , who left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road .
plywood were dismant@@ led and was rebuilt in the border of the border .
nobody wanted to go out to the goal of this Umb@@ ria .
Austria reach the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country has increased its limit controlled .
but to the 20,000 migrants in the country , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the German authorities in the morning .
a small groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
Mayor drove out &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday and suddenly ten people with rice off@@ ended at the entrance of the Zel@@ ts , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ al mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to do with the train to Passau .
because Germany on Sunday , however , because of the refugee flow of the railway traffic with Austria was surprising , it was right for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so the Stad@@ ler , who immediately met his help with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Na@@ he Passau .
before , we spent the un@@ hoped guests only once , with J@@ ause and beverages .
we told you , we bring them with the car to Passau .
&quot; that was of course , &quot; the city centre in O@@ Ö@@ N @-@ conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this has been very pleased to us , so the Stad@@ ler .
at the Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE in W@@ els from a ICE in a regional direction to Passau , in order to try it after the short term , the railway traffic has been set to Germany , but still on the border to try .
but the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein on Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a day before the European Union , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more Z@@ ig@@ thousands to us , is a logical result of an apparent holy policy :
instead of structures in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures , our Chancellor is highly officially and publicly responsible for the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ icky of the National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ ys this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
even the ge@@ aring will find that the &quot; gel@@ ed Land , &quot; which is invited to welcome and welcome , nothing more than another refugee camp .
it will become a great challenge , given to the persistent refugee and the end of winter , with us human conditions for protection .
and there will be a bigger - peace , safety and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ ing quartz
Konrad has to do all his hands with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is a usual that his word has been weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first quarter of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received in the handle .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported by his first success .
the accommodation of 20,000 refugees came to Austria on Monday to Austria , be without great host , he said Konrad and lob@@ te the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ performance . &quot;
the Interior Ministry said by a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad with a need of 8@@ 5,000 quartz in the he@@ ur@@ ian year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 properties have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the covenant .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but there is no f@@ ass without ground , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already led talks with the country &apos;s country .
these could be secured him , even for the coming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it runs well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied how the church will help .
great expectations sets the asylum coordin@@ ator also in the ORF action &quot; hel@@ pers as we . &quot;
on the platform you can easily offer private individuals .
in addition , one hopes to find hotels , which are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in emergency times it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ous must keep a certain height of hand@@ tu@@ ch@@ holder or size of the upper part .
for a long time , &quot; Not@@ ices &quot; apply . &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry of the accommodation , he was successful with his experience .
I am a older Lord , which man is not without any further into the face .
beliefs be his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er does not cause the Republic of the Republic , as they declared itself .
they want to increase their employees on three to four .
the own quot@@ ation was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted a container at the end of the country as an office .
but there is no problems with permission .
Linz calls a better performance
first no opening urban sports and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees planning the city of Linz .
this is currently not necessary , since you can use the people without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but for the emergency , other locations should be tested on their divers .
criticism of the city center at the distribution of refugees within the federal states .
other districts have to afford their contribution here .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders are not rounded &quot;
in a longer phone calls with the Bavarian Minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , the State Secretary of Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the further prec@@ ursor in the refugee question .
See@@ hofer has insured me that the German borders are not rounded .
the journey of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the respective limit controlled .
special components with refugees to Germany will not be no more .
however , the protective search would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
from the other EU Member States called P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question .
that now , Austria also leads to his borders again , is a logical consequence of the Germans .
the next Run@@ tastic is a question of time
the General Assembly of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the Trial Chamber of IT @-@ Group S &amp; T rose , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is supposed to be rented for young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in the IT , the smart heads of our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ boss Hannes Netherlands .
he could imagine to invest in start @-@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard and later also to ac@@ qui@@ res .
already from the beginning of the beginning , S &amp; T will cooperate with the new neighbors - which is a lot of precip@@ itation : &quot; the next Run@@ tastic is only a question of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country Ober@@ österreich and the covenant ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .

larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop has been in operation .
previously , several weeks was rebuilt .
&quot; I have long over@@ lays whether I should open a shop , &quot; says wide .
the decision for the decision was among other things that also the Fur@@ la producer that are home in Bologna , from the idea of a own site that were sold to only their hand@@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your fashion interest has been wide from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
most of me , when something is developed and I can show new trends at performance prices .
why some woman can answer a beautiful hand@@ bag in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , can also answer the knowledge of the last security .
maybe it is that a nice bag of each Out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came out of a place where the inhabitants of An@@ ders are called .
this property combines man@@ cher also with the milli@@ ard@@ ant , the US president wants .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for maintenance .
whether he was revealed to foreign enemy , journalists , or science in the international crisis policy - the applicants for the US Presi@@ dency is strong on the election campaign .
and cuts well .
this will also be registered in the pf@@ z@@ ic K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate of the real estate .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is many in the win@@ ch village on the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants place is over -@@ zig corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers be about his goal , most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that are somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter species also not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native of K@@ all@@ Town has turned a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ inkl@@ es , among which Tr@@ ump also has the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for fittings , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it there to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ant the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; was a bit of a large mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random name , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius of the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too high German : the attacks , says it .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the attacks .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather began and opened a restaurant for gold in the USA .
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate concepts were the first basic conditions in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of traction : your wish to return to the homeland in the Bavarian State , to whom the Pfalz belonged to the time .
he didn &apos;t have Tr@@ ump , because it was once without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic history and folk songs , Roland Paul , to the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal extin@@ ction . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ning statements of the neighbour .
it was repeated due to Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border wall to remove illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the Polish , it is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a few Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the Win@@ zer in retirement looks rather dist@@ orted , &quot; he is always so far out . &quot;
do he believes that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never met K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sions in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ram mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , that a replica of the Heinz has ended something for the Church &apos;s church , which was generally good .
&quot; I cannot introduce myself from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they are better when he didn &apos;t have the choice if he didn &apos;t know such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
if those who had the time of his grand@@ parents in the USA , as he had been , &quot; he would never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting topics as him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah stage .
and as President ?
&quot; my President is it not , &quot; says it .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;

the last three vote : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may possibly be clear who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor , was finally covered in the largest secret .
and no one of the three left remaining girl will certainly not give you whether it is the one that has received the last Rose .
but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on day before they may be acci@@ dentally given a note that will be the victory .
Sam Wood holds his lips until the final on Thursday .
all three women have left in ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense for humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; we could have their answers to the game who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki @-@ called both fast - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and SA@@ MS energies , I felt that it was pretty compatible , and I thought it in the entire course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on the earth with both feet on Earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that it would be well suited to Sam Wood as a couple .
from her view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week you made it clear that Wood &quot; can be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw it with my friends and the family , that this obviously was not only a game - I am not subject to him , &quot; said it . &quot;
and when she was asked to choose the Wood , if not it , because she was r@@ ying .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; said she .
I love the left girl alike - it &apos;s an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in the USA - and there were many other teams that sent to its impressive training day at the end of the last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach could have seen Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , as he lost a Ger@@ sh@@ by @-@ League conver@@ ching on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula showed his true face in the reverse cabin after the game .
instead of his Roo@@ bs before the rest of the teams by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne also encouraged by Spezi@@ alt@@ e@@ ams Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who was to forget to forget his pat@@ ern@@ ess , and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne was restored at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minnesota .
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian track for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the game field , and told later the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine any longer start in his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; this was a thing that comes to the next game , and it &apos;s just about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne ver@@ ted the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

the Free voters call for the high refugee numbers of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party - and Fra@@ ct@@ ance Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger was not according to the beginning of the FW crisis in a major crisis in front of a serious crisis . &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the colonies , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get inter@@ ventions in the Bavarian image system . &quot;
the country fra@@ ction of the Free voters from Friday to Friday in the underground Commun@@ e Commun@@ e .
actually , quite other main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is dominated by the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum is over@@ laid down the clause . &quot; he said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave it during the Yugoslavia wars in the ninth years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free voters as fast as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also asked more personnel for the administrative dishes that are responsible for asylum , &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .

Google launches Ver@@ double @-@ donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double @-@ double @-@ donations campaign to help thousands of refugees who have increased thousands of refugees to escape the European nations , as they flee from the war .
Google has a unusual personal approach at the announcement of the donations of donations on his blog .
instead of a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old , over her personal experience .
&quot; at our journey , many dark railway stations and bus trips , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them .
I had lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe has grown to many people like my family desper@@ ate to help .
donations will go to four non @-@ profit organizations , the help for refugees and migrants at disposal : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for refugees .
Google said that the first global collected donations can be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / h @-@ based on 11 million $ doubled .
Europe is confronted with his worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people in this year .

for light , weight di@@ abe@@ tics can be helpful .
the advantages of weight surgery for easy to last people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say , whether easy to get an important people with diabetes after the weight surgery longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the steri@@ lization data require a long time to show something to show something , said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a Editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A .
weight loss operations or Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the mag@@ ician .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to record food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been carried out in humans , the disease ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is important , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered fat .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers made from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two kinds of Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ ypass and gast@@ ric education - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes .
the average BMI under which this operation fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI remained with those that non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments received about 29 .
among those who grew up to an surgical procedure , with 36 % of diabetes disease completely and at 28 % .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with the diabetes , it was completely only about two percent in comparison with only two percent .
in addition , the results were with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors .
researchers have also reflected the patients of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of the time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is held at the best under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you are reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced the death in five years , as the leader of Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team will also be added to the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached greater return to the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) , and have a complete over@@ flow of diabetes ( 4@@ 6,9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survival part of the surgery after five years , there are references from a study of heavy people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was with obes@@ e @-@ operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was soothing for people with a BMI under 35 , which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think that we will wait for long , until we bring people to take this seriously . &quot;
I think as soon as they have taken these genetic changes to have their body with fat and diabetes , is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not take all the refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders called to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the refugee camps at the beginning of his ten days in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , the ethics studies .
he asked that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity before the interests of individual nations or even continents should be asked .
he also stressed the reaction of the West European countries on the refugee crisis , but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in the crisis of the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; in order to take several thousand refugees , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for those Muslim countries can be created . &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented on the terrorist attack according to the terrorist attack from 11 September and presented that the violent reaction of the USA moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 11 September I went to President Bush in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to the solution of this problem is in violence .
&quot; I know , his mot@@ if@@ s were good , but he put violence , and that has un@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four years of intake from Hän@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ers by children in the last 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ con@@ tro@@ ll@@ ery in the United States report about nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which are strong alcoholic towel , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues from Hand@@ des@@ inf@@ ant for children under 12 years , the Gi@@ ft@@ con@@ tro@@ ll@@ ery reports , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are always more common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the emergency &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children can drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some it do to im@@ print their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ant can drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have report@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mouth water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be loaded by attractive jets of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attraction ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berries , vine and orange , which are very promising for children .
slopes are included somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sy@@ ll@@ ery can be pois@@ oned for alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ call centre in the hospital of Kansas , the Fox Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not have a swal@@ ck whis@@ ky , but people let this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children are coming , then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a se@@ wage @-@ year girl , which had taken four sy@@ zer from after straw@@ berry du@@ de@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was taken into a notation for treatment .
it was 179 , twice higher than the threshold which is regarded as the threshold that is considered by an adult law , Dr. Chris , ey , a emergency doctor , which she moved to the G@@ winn@@ ings Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go to the situation when she came in the emergency .
doctors talked about night in a separate children &apos;s sick house on the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol , and the head had done .
&quot; that was very anxi@@ ous , &quot; Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ar &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could be fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended , soft free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant to use or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside of the child .
on alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ant were linked to death cases .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the gor@@ ges of Hän@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous , which had a toxic , not declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities decided that the product meth@@ anol was contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was used as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged during the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period of May to July during the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole period around 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million .
Scottish unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the offices for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell to 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell on 7@@ 4.0 per cent - a number over the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest numbers and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year that Scotland has taken the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements to the Scottish labour market with an increase of employment and a decline of unemployment .
bet@@ r@@ unk@@ y distur@@ bing the process
as the security , the situation was not satisfactory , the employees called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could take in awareness .
a respir@@ ation test resulted in a 16 @-@ year old 0.@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the Hercules was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ year old had 2,@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le and stayed at the awareness .
why I will be an executive board in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spectators gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p will be ex@@ alted by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked .
when the day closer , I started to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I thought , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may be seen in the USA , and often there are more applicants than seats at the USA , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery is held to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media places of 12 to five .
who is selected , it will observe emotional .
I cannot do this .
I will sit in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship with telephone and a half @-@ hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh often if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to draw a notebook and a pin to draw what I see .
I have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma signed me on Twitter , my in@@ part@@ itions .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants to receive access .
I used myself with her .
they spatial that she could have had better form@@ ulate , &quot; but it is still wrong that it is wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I told and wrote .
he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants that an international rep@@ orter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a replica of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Podcasts which I did .
I don &apos;t want to go here again on all details .
I cannot say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions according to the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to be an end of fact .
but I think that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I think it is not enough evidence that there is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will die him .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other rep@@ orter to contact you .
what you will get from me , what it is called a man to die an un@@ necessary death .

Con@@ sci@@ Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not very excited to make its Uni@@ form n@@ ass , therefore he turned a reliable tactics - &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do fun things to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ ings .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to finish him and dro@@ ves to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tries to install a sp@@ ion in his st@@ ables and threatened to end the race immediately .
he aims at the ste@@ wards and the Integration department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday , led .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he himself found himself under difficult conditions , when it went to the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ sample at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had returned to 18 months because of the Sp@@ ion@@ age incident , and didn &apos;t want to see that there is &quot; I see as high @-@ hand grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say nothing to say , and I have long to eat , but sometimes they are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes to once . &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know that it is extensive .
sometimes you re@@ acts , and you must live with the consequences , and I have to live what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to go out , and I would like to think my owner , that I am trying to try my best for them .
if they start to think , I do not do this , then I should not be more trainer .
I have to think what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy the bomb had to leave the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integration department had tried to arrange his stable .
&quot; before the eighte@@ en months Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will be asked to deliver information about what I do in my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com .
they believe that I am a beta .
if this is the case , they should surely be able to deal with her n@@ oses , because they have chosen me to kill me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of its time and are still alive today .
should I bring me to the view that it is personally ?
has the RV@@ L turned out and makes people responsible outside of trainers what is in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take me my license , and I have no doubt that I say what I say , she is now thinking about it .
but I arrived at the point where it is no matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will practice the pressure on them , and to meet them to meet a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the trainers have been built with the long @-@ term cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching , he said that he could throw his license about the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the uncertain m@@ ness , &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay were applied to the horse .
&quot; it is against the rules of the racing sports .
I have to take the full responsibility for this , he said .
&quot; one of my employee has suffered mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been the whole day yesterday , so what was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a tri@@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ fication dis@@ qualified for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules , do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ mer proposes to fight against ri@@ vals due to ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ mer has a criticism of his player as &quot; Agenda S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney RO@@ O@@ ST@@ ERS Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ ration of the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ ers &quot; with his team during the high Storm @-@ Sie@@ gs in Sydney in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett had a barely ver@@ ty @-@ victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queens@@ land is not &quot; too good &quot; in the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ a@@ waited the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team , and said that they can only be concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ y added that the criticism of two leading coach to his team is confident that they were worried about the Storm team .
&quot; I &apos;ve always heard it again - I didn &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson over Ring@@ ers said to us when they have 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ y on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing to our def@@ en@@ sive system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ dy to a real focus , and that has provided for us the trend .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he has obviously a great team to train . it is probably not to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it &apos;s already funny as this is always up to this season .
Bell@@ ong has been attacked by the idea of the &quot; exciting football &quot; attacked and his ment@@ or remember that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he was compared to our Saturday evening with our debut on Friday evening and how exciting your game was , &quot; said Bell@@ ly .
I remember that in 2010 St George became a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play , if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like this .
I build confidence , because they say these things , because they have a bit worried about us to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t have thought about us when it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ y also proved that the game Storm against RO@@ O@@ ST@@ ERS was a higher result as the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not yet viewed , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not have any points anything ?
for me it is the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet in one phase still .
the Storm team is free of this weekend , since they have won the right to receive North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . the ticket sales starts from next service .

a man who might have a life sentence threat@@ ens to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were s@@ laugh@@ tered according to Queens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .

the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the flu@@ ent of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
at the Criminal Court he took the police over his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and boots had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; according to the reading of the two people , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial load , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan .
but that alone is not enough to keep him from it , not to appear .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , among the conditions that he gives his Australian and his Serbian pass , at the police daily , and at an output of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square cells are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial Te@@ gel , who was placed in a small cell in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human rights , prisoners have set up to financial compensation when they are housed in small cells .

this was a ex @-@ prisoner with his Constitutional will be successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the Just@@ iz@@ able Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meter surface ; the toilet was not separated .
after that man was the man who has now been moved on free foot , in a larger cell .
its officers , due to the un@@ preced@@ ented conditions against the country in Berlin .
but the Constitutional Court took the verdict of the Chamber of the Chamber of Berlin in Berlin and rejected the case for the renewed test .
they see the human rights of man .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if the legal reasons for compensation reasons only a few days of prison days for compensation , be the same name , was called it .

the chamber court has to be clari@@ fy the height of schol@@ ar .
the Constitutional Court have been strengthened in the past , often the rights of criminal prisoners were strengthened .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
refugees from refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Ministry in this year after the statement by Vice @-@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has been demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge . &quot; I say again and again : we can create this , and we create this . &quot;
what comes to Germany , the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the pest@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years long .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living room but especially at paid rental objects : annually 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments from the rental cost , and around these especially favorable apartments are also apply to refugees .
the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is this from the view of the pest@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social apartments each year , and the covenant would have to invest a promotion of 6.4 billion per year .
scientists and Federal Minister , scientists and Federal Minister , that there is also more control parts for investments in the housing construction .
according to estimates of the Institute for Labour market and vocational research , the long @-@ term 55 percent of ge@@ aring can be made in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany could not be asked for their qualification to help them at the entry , critic@@ ized Claudia Walter , project man@@ ag@@ er for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , however , is crucial if they find in Germany work .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says mig@@ rant for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany it has given a political turn to a political turn : from the labour offered for refugees to recognition of work .
while it was used for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ light , the asylum seek@@ ers are limited to a residential resort .
in society - also because of the specialist in the company , the visibility has set the visibility that refugees should be able to be able to be able to access the labour market .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient offer to general and professional language courses .
studies show that jobs are most commonly used by personal contacts .
this is why the construction of networks is therefore to view from Thr@@ än@@ hardt to work integration .
the Berlin school management has found that only a few , parents will give her children into the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ onite parents , it is only very important to hold the family , says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate .
to convince the family , however , to convince the benefits of the K@@ ita in different languages .
if the need to rise to refugees through the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - approximately , by using more professional schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared without German knowledge on the lessons .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by apprenti@@ ces , which only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ ing of the Berlin school management .
the German student works that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or committed the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank handle ( CDU ) has now abandoned its attitude .
studying refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
for refugees with a residence or Dul@@ ce do not get any services after asylum seek@@ ers , if they start studying .
the latter is basically no BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G because they don &apos;t fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ers .
Ged@@ ul@@ led refugees had to have lived four years in Germany to be eligible to be BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G to be shortened to 15 months from January 1 , 2016 .
however , these financial statements must be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the German student .
students should get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G immediately .
Islam will play a most important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion important part of their identity .
the state should have the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to the foundation of an Islamic charity , which cares professionally around the curiosity .
the rights also belong to the right hand .
so the representative of Islam must be clear to clear contact with the state in many areas and have certain control options .
this also belongs to the will@@ ingness to go against religious foundations .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , who could be carried out on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be worn after Germany .
those who wanted to wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately her right to stay in Germany , &quot; he said , &quot; he said in Bay@@ ric Broadcasting .
he struck to translate the Basic Law on arab@@ ic .
integration will be much more than today a theme of all society .
the majority society will also change the majority of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany has a result of European decisions - as a result of European decisions - since a cr@@ ust decade have a anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General of equality law .
but it is very slow how the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed , in the police and authorities the rapid motive systematic .
the same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the interest groups of Germany have a long challenge and why international agreement must remain in the next few years , if the country will remain peace@@ fully and their new citizens shall be able to use their new citizens - to the well @-@ le of all .
in general , Germany can be able to supply the expected refugees to supply the most expected refugees Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; he said the daily mirror .
however , you can flow additional money into the system .
to avoid Eng@@ p@@ sports , it calls Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all attacks on the registration health insurance .
services could be charged later with the federal states .
and long @-@ term , it is highly frag@@ ile , so many people with the limited power catalog , which see the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , doctors make the doctors to create the language .
so far , the Berlin health scientific The@@ a Bor@@ de has been detected , migrants are worse than other patients as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical care have to be taken interpretation , calls for them .
in many refugees , many refugees would have also been working with more common medical address in the emergency industry .
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee camps , there are considerably more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people go to HIV .
with the partially other path@@ ways , German doctors have been clear from their training , but the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite be@@ ard or tuber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and what the sleeves is concerned , be even lens in sight .
the Syrians had a highly developed image system , some refugees may even be doctors .
to practice , however , they would have to assign their qualification and sc@@ ars out again .
at least half of the coming refugees in Germany has been sick for the estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ an therapist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ic sick : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic power disorder or under depression .
the refugee camp , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recently published study of the TU Munich , that every fifth Syrian refugee camps happened in Germany .
those who is used to a post @-@ trau@@ matic power disorder , among other things to Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ h@@ en and death .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentrations disorders , strong sciss@@ ors and emotional divers .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , be an early treatment , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psychological disease refugees receive an Psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ic disease asylum seek@@ ers have a request for a Psycho@@ therapy , but the processing usually lasts several months .
in addition , they would not be trained in social workers or doctors that are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this will often lead to mis@@ erable , says Mun@@ z .

Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts to the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will share this year later and the computer and printer business of its faster growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in a declaration .
&quot; this re@@ structured measures will allow a competitive cost , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , which is to lead the unit according to the separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of shops , which support companies in the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better placed than ever before , to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on the provision , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such a statement of the company .
it is a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , in order to produce electro @-@ plants and their Palo Alto Garage one has called the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ structure to manage the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .

FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ work are standing in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if its rehabilitation is to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas again before Christmas .
this optimum scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere certainly does not miss at least the next four games for England and in the next summer of its history , his participation in the next summer of the European Championship is certainly un@@ fortunate .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le , and then had finished again to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury not threatened the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bones who healed not well .
this is no bigger matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his buttons or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the corresponding danger of other injuries , always if a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ comfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime In@@ j@@ uries Ltd are listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut before six years ago .
he also played in just 65 from Arsen@@ as 157 Lig@@ asp@@ asp@@ ing in the last five times .
the wider image for Arsenal is that they were in six months of eight times since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League clubs , most of the most vulner@@ able days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the risk rate during the last season is expected .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from a violation of injury , you have to strengthen a time in which you have to strengthen your body and martial arts , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it , and he shall go a career from the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ . on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the teams .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of re@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and players who need to treat a small dist@@ al break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although arsen@@ al are clear favor@@ ites , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the game areas with the largest bay effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is un@@ beaten after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; campaign in the last season was launched .
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , where the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,2 was measured .
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never been working with arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other side I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not iner@@ tia .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy show , which is serious and serious lessons over the ner@@ ves
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in regard to the need for men to open , now even more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , as self @-@ term rates of young men at a 15 @-@ year @-@ H@@ och .
in 2013 it was the most important death cause in men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women .
in the band , the problem announced , the Camp@@ a@@ ign against Living Mis@@ er@@ ous ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a di@@ p@@ ful life ) 2015 as the year of man , with the aim to search the culture in question , to search the men of them , if they need them .
friendship is the heart of fight for this challenge .
a current study at more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms set up that if the body had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of comra@@ des .
for those who are not de@@ press@@ ants , half a circle of spiritual friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course , one must only have friends to work for a friendship .
in the age of more than social media , with its focus on substance about substance is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , life and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ulating values - our internal longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game @-@ inventor and milli@@ ard@@ ant recently declared , money can &apos;t really buy luck .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , the interaction of the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent hu@@ gs to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men came out of the knowledge that men came to any case , even if they are often back to explore their feelings .
as a staff of the telephone , it explained me : ... &quot; my list@@ eners for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ slip , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us , are often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense if I try to provide long @-@ term impair@@ ment .
they presented quite clearly the small moments of male women .
so much my objective external lateral status of the phone can also help people in eye look like a long @-@ term support , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit to this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely new setting , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello .

with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k in the group A requires a strong start against the Swedish master , as it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the fourth quarter in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Bras@@ him@@ ics . he was later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his own career in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or backwards in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents and relaxed , even if there are certain things , which we have to be perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good pre@@ sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it , that we did not have a or two further gates . &quot;
in his violation of three changes in Paris team returned to his violation of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold on their own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was found in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
in the last month of Manchester United States , the PS@@ G was taken over the next step in Europe when he ran into the last month of Manchester United States , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he went to Johan Wil@@ and over beautiful in the long corner of the multilingual network .
if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off came to reach this level , at the field with nine national play on the field , and had a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ legal dj@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tra@@ tips P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they went little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself was sometimes based on , with some mis@@ ery and bad evenings , not least less than five attempts alone in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill , when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass by Z@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria was placed in a torque , which was taken by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute .
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Swiss ay@@ er generated his six@@ ty season , after pol@@ him@@ ovic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that finished all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back to the game , and only an excellent input of Wil@@ and from a short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result of E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized at the end of the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we played only in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level .
the quali@@ fier are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Rome now has a Martin Luther square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of the city of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday , a previously known place in the Park on the Opp@@ io hill on the name of the German reform@@ ators .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now called &quot; German the@@ ologist of the Reformation .
the park is in the middle of the old Rome next to the Colos@@ seum .
the name was published by the Labour community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remembered that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Ponti@@ f@@ ste than centuries often could live in the bor@@ dered its faith .
the place will be visible in symbolic manner that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held in Rome at the end of 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he found the city then as a result of sin .
his negative impressions would be given him to view from histor@@ ians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther was then led with his th@@ es against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del , the split of the ab@@ om@@ ination church .
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main plants that painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible tex@@ tures .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures .
at the beginning , the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt , who has been form@@ ulated in 150 mot@@ if@@ s his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and f@@ antas@@ ies has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is not equal with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the respective topics can be adapted , it can be quite dark .
in his Bible project , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked for a subjective artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these cycles are cycles such as cross @-@ g , pl@@ ages , commandments , or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
in this way , he was fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther publisher with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who set itself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible .
he was interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible and translated to the Today , in current interaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ale mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded in between the original Bible , by Martin Luther and each one set of the artist who form@@ ulated his personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry band has golden lungs .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is equal to a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately raised for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that heard the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order .
&quot; when the education happened to the pipe &quot; , Ot@@ mar old was re@@ minded .
&quot; I tried to work to work in order to carry me again with the Lord Father . &quot;
his second concern be , the art in fast lively time to help more job : &quot; the perception of image is characterized by Advert@@ ise , and that is loud .
Sym@@ bo@@ lik is fed .
artists have a different desire and wound things to show things .
images always have something secret and are not decorative .

DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga is a clear sign .
the football respon@@ ds to the present location in Germany and the policy of politics his help with the increasing problems .
&quot; I think the largest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there is no one in principle , that &apos;s nothing to do , I have nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; this must be able to get this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang kidney s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to inten@@ tions the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancellor and meet the State Minister Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the soccer can help and save wool .
but the decisive wheat must make the policy .
the German football covenant therefore has its refugee sin@@ ative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we asked that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; explained kidney s@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .

&quot; the refugee drama goes every one , nobody may see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football federal government , no , we have to use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who already have so incredibly yellow to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .

robot cars : government wants to use Pre@@ re@@ iter@@ ation for Germany
Germany is supposed to be the Federal Government of the Federal Government on the change of the car technical .
on Wednesday , the Federal wireless paper decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from traffic Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt am the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
the automated and networked driving will increase the traffic safety and provide less st@@ aus , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the topic of the G7 states that come together with representatives from the G7 , also with representatives of industry .
the strategy of the traffic paper emphas@@ izes the importance of the mobile broad@@ band exhaust and a huge conversion on digital list@@ ener .
the new technique is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
with the driver &quot; no additional liability ris@@ ons will be released , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , Germany will ensure that the maximum speed for self @-@ speed cars will be raised from 10 to 130 hours .
in addition , the Federal Government wants to use a change of the Vienna Convention , which only sees people as a driver .
when automated driving takes over the car , the car , the driver is more and more to passenger .
the technology is based on sensors and cameras , the environment and the data can be used in sector .
after one of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 is possible to be technically possible .
nevertheless , all vehicles are expected to be expected to expect from 2020 to 2020 . &quot;

&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic sp@@ ol@@ iti@@ ker S@@ aints Bart@@ ol .
the question of liability for accidents and safety of the personal data of the drivers are clearly clari@@ fied .
even more than French or Americans still see the German self @-@ car cars .

in France , 21 percent of those asked to 2025 with aut@@ on@@ om cars , in the US 33 percent .
we are not ready to leave the drivers in Germany still not ready to leave to an independent vehicle .
after a collection of digital bit@@ glau@@ coma , only seven percent agree to give control during the whole trip to all roads .
on the highway , it could imagine 15 percent in the flu@@ ent traffic , in the St@@ au 45 percent .
good everybody would leave the car under no circumstances .

actually he had been , for me , for me a exhibition was a little after death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had already made before the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it go to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly one of the work of the man , the fashion history has written without ever completed a training .

jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ needle
earlier , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around pl@@ ump , meters to make .
the best substances and tips created in great amount for customers that they worked for example to ceilings and gar@@ d@@ ine .
this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains the managing director of the Mo@@ des .
instead , the mode is very important .
in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ dien@@ tip , fashion played a larger role , then the home industry has been re@@ formed by the home tex@@ tual industry and is now re@@ discovered as N@@ ic .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , with accessories like pockets and regional traction .
at all bil@@ de the so @-@ called Vintage Fashion , which re@@ jects itself to the past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ ets , an increasing contra@@ ction .
who is served in the textile sector in Germany , no more on the market .
with us they already make half of all orders .
mo@@ ck@@ les Pl@@ auen is a member of nine further companies in the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and Sti@@ cker@@ ters .
only they may bear the protected label .
around 80 percent of sales were broken in the last 15 years .
private trade and the wholesale prices are almost no longer .
our products can hardly achieve our customers in this way .
the mass will be made much cheaper in Asian space and almost exclusively for chains .
in addition , the export of export , currently according to Russia and the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association tries to be explained by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; for this year we will perform a quality of quality , that we produce ecological and soci@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt is supple@@ mented : &quot; this refers to the used materials . &quot;
diplom@@ ats in U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snow @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts and is specialized on styles and tips .
to find the competition from the Asian room , one must find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and those who have to think especially economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design often become just slightly varies to keep a customer .
some years ago , textile design in Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historical snow@@ eb@@ all@@ tip new .
mix the machine at some places small cows .
the Pl@@ au@@ dien@@ ces in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ se was inspired by this : &quot; before I couldn &apos;t start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now they uses the snow @-@ tip for their jewelry .
in an elab@@ orate procedure , they represent the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors have lived in Pl@@ aying and surroundings .
so I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ strian tip .
