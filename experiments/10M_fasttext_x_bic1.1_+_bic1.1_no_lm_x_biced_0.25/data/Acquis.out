( 1 ) The effic@@ acy of the reag@@ ents to blood @-@ group determination of most specif@@ ies will be expressed as Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ st@@ ites , which is observed in a series of dil@@ ute with a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ ten@@ tion .
the T@@ iter gives the dil@@ ution of the test in the last mix within a series , when using a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination .
the effic@@ acy of the reag@@ ents to blood group determination are present ( present an anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and ink@@ om@@ pl@@ ettes anti @-@ D ) , based on the basis of tit@@ ration of unknown reag@@ ents in international units ( See Bulletin WHO OMS , 10 , 937 , 941 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
it brings you back to a volume of 1 ml , containing the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B s@@ ors according to the definition of 256 International units per ml .
the preparation are free of charge of the International Labor@@ atorium for biological standards of World Health Organisation , Stat@@ ens Serum , Copenhagen , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of compar@@ ative tit@@ ration of the International Standard ser@@ um ( S ) and an &quot; Un@@ known &quot; Anti @-@ A @-@ Re@@ agent ( U ) and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the manufacturer recommended conditions , so the necessary properties will remain at least one year long .
the failure of a Re@@ agent in flu@@ ori@@ ger form is at most a year after the last satis@@ factory effects .
based on the label is assigned to the label for dry respon@@ si@@ es , according to results of durability tests ; it is possible by the state authorities of government agencies .
dry respon@@ si@@ es are kept in a atmosphere of iner@@ alized gas or in a vacuum cleaner , which has dried up in the glass bottles where it is closed , and so that no moisture can be sw@@ allowed .
a dry re@@ acting may lose a maximum of 0,5 b.@@ g. of its weight , if it is not tested by more drying over phosph@@ or@@ pen@@ to@@ xy@@ d in a pressure of no more than 0.02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacter@@ ial growth , the economic authority may determine the re@@ agent ( or related to the dry re@@ acts ) a Ant@@ is@@ ep@@ tics , and / or anti@@ biot@@ ics are still provided with the added subst@@ rate to specif@@ icity specif@@ icity and effec@@ tiveness .
sera human origin of blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ ids , or re@@ dissolved ser@@ um .
the reag@@ ents , equal to whether in flu@@ ids form or after rest@@ art , must transparent and must not contain se@@ di@@ ments or visible particles .
for the international exchange of particular reag@@ ents to blood group order should not be artificial , at least as long as not until the international Convention on a single system has come .
reag@@ ents to blood group determination are based on such as such as testing of tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to conduct tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity to be found in a container must be so great that the contents , in this protocol , may be used in this protocol , can be used in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has over all production levels and controls of the reag@@ ents to blood @-@ determination of written records .
re@@ hear@@ s@@ als of all reported re@@ reag@@ ents are so long from the laboratory to store up until with some prob@@ ability to be assumed that Char@@ ge is no longer used .
the blood group determin@@ ants used samples can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective tools for ampli@@ fication of effic@@ acy and preserv@@ ation of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agent is divided into three groups after the origin of their real estate .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin is included , or that animal or plant re@@ agent does not contain any substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black printed label in English and French language to att@@ ach the following information : first name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , with dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid necessary liquid ,
furthermore , this label or label is located on the cardboard box , where the containers are included in which the containers are included : 1 . complete name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the quantity or , for dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid necessary liquid ,
each show is to add a certificate of article 4 of the agreement to this protocol .

anti @-@ R@@ h hem@@ ros@@ ens@@ era every specif@@ icity can be one of two types , which is distingu@@ ished by the requirements of which an ag@@ glut@@ ination is hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells .
with other , which are called &quot; ink@@ om@@ pl@@ ett &quot; , a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved with pre @-@ hand @-@ specific colon@@ ids such as b@@ ov@@ alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of special methods .
some &quot; ink@@ om@@ pl@@ ets &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating on object are also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are cur@@ dled in their own ser@@ um or plasma .
the following requirements to the effec@@ tiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly alter if the International standard pre@@ par@@ ate is available ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is produced from the blood of one or several people , which are immune to the An@@ tigen D of R@@ h @-@ Systems .
it respon@@ ds to human red blood cells which contain the anti@@ gen D , but not with human red blood cells which does not contain the anti@@ gen D .
&quot; complete &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a T@@ iter of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
