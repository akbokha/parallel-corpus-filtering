injection solution is used for rapid control of st@@ opping un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral inter@@ ference , if the oral intake of medication is not possible .
in both cases the solution can be applied for inser@@ tion or melting range of patients in patients who prepar@@ es the frag@@ ments of tablets .
in patients receiving other medicines at the same time , the dose should be derived from Ab@@ il@@ ify .

Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol works mainly as &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less extent than the ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to enable the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine by Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar dis@@ order to norm@@ alize the activity of brain or norm@@ alize , resulting from psych@@ otic or man@@ eu@@ otic symptoms and their rest@@ ing is avo@@ ided .
the effic@@ acy of Ab@@ il@@ ify , preventing the symptoms of symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year .
the effec@@ tiveness of injection solution was compared with 805 patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar dis@@ orders that suffered from two hours to placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Ab@@ il@@ ify was more than twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the effic@@ acy of abor@@ ate and placebo to prevent rest@@ ing up to 160 patients , with which the man@@ ian symptoms had been stabil@@ ized with waste oil .
the effic@@ acy of abor@@ ate injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar dis@@ order that suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ onic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar dis@@ order or number of patients who were examined on treatment , examined .
the company also resulted in studies to exam@@ ine how the body the melting tabl@@ etten and the solution for inser@@ tion ( decre@@ ases ) .
in the two studies with injection solution , patients who received dos@@ es in dos@@ es of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,75 mg or 15 mg received significantly more stronger reduction of symptoms and patients who received placebo .
in four of the five short @-@ term studies in four of the five short @-@ term studies of inter@@ pol@@ ishing symptoms were more effective than placebo .
abor@@ ate pre@@ domin@@ ate more than 74 weeks of more effective than placebo during previously treated patients and when it was administ@@ ered to an existing treatment .
cut @-@ out injection ections in 10 or 15 @-@ mg dos@@ es also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms and were ali@@ ke like Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common ad@@ verse events of abor@@ ate ( observed at 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ am@@ id@@ ale inter@@ dis@@ orders ( constant flow ) , sp@@ inal hyper@@ ten@@ tion ( increased saving production ) , sp@@ inal hyper@@ ten@@ tion ( increased saving production ) , fatigue and ex@@ cre@@ tion , ru@@ pe@@ ac@@ ity , In@@ som@@ nie ( sleep dis@@ rup@@ tions ) and Ang@@ ular states .
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ators ( CH@@ MP ) has reached the conclusion that the advantages of abor@@ ating sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and of medium @-@ severe episodes at the treatment of Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and with the prevention of a new man@@ ic epis@@ ode in patients , the mainly man@@ o@@ ic episodes and with those episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol said , compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee also came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in the fast control of injection practices and behavi@@ oral inter@@ ference in patients with chlor@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , or patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the inter@@ course of abor@@ ating abor@@ ate in the entire European Union .
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is for treatment of regular up to severe episodes of the Bipolar I@@ - dis@@ order and for the prevention of a new man@@ ian epis@@ ode to patients who had the greater part of man@@ ages and their man@@ o@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day during an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
the effec@@ tiveness of dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effec@@ tiveness of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bipolar I@@ - dis@@ order in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with respect to the bigger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial frequency dose should be considered to be considered for clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction consists of combination therapy , the Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ or dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icide behaviour is to mental dis@@ orders and aff@@ ective dis@@ orders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after altern@@ ating an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epidem@@ i@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar dis@@ order no increased su@@ icide risk of su@@ icide in comparison to other non @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ c@@ raz@@ ol should be applied to patients with known cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease ( cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease , conditions , cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ tic and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials that had a year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol .
if using a ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y treated patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ia , should be taken into consider@@ ation to reduce the dose or treatment .
if a patient signs and symptoms developed to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manif@@ estation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
as a result , Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol was supposed to be applied to patients with cr@@ amp in the an@@ am@@ nese or case that are applied with cr@@ amp in connection to be applied with cau@@ tion .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had treated patients who were treated with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , a increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ wanted du@@ v@@ ascular events were treated with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ ose or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic effects , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there is no exact risk provisions for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related events in patients with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic effects of patients receiving direct calls .

a weight increase is generally expressed in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bid@@ ding , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , where weight increases as a secondary effect , and could lead to severe contam@@ ination and could lead to severe comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol on the central nerv@@ ous system , cau@@ tion is commanded , if Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol is supported in combination with alcohol or other central drug effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist of Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , an gast@@ ric acid block@@ er , reduces the re@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant than clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D6 inhibit@@ or ( Chinese ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ in and par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects and therefore should be done similar dos@@ es .
at CY@@ P2@@ D6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ ism , the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol results in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D6 .
if you have shared the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors using ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefit of potenti@@ ally benefits for the patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should be similar effects , and therefore they should be done similar dos@@ es .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be raised before the start of the companion .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D6 together with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , can be administ@@ ered with a regular increase in the Ari@@ c@@ raz@@ ol@@ - concentration .
in clinical trials , dos@@ es of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ c@@ raz@@ ol per day no significant effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of the subst@@ rate of CY@@ P2@@ D6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 meth@@ ox@@ ym@@ orph@@ an ) , 2C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patient should be avo@@ ided to notify your doctor if she conceived , or a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol .
due to the un@@ satis@@ fying data protection for security at humans and due to the re@@ productive studies at the animal , this medication may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the possible benefits is just@@ ified the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be used to use haz@@ ard@@ ous machines , including power vehicles , to use , until they are certain that Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol has no influence on them .
the following events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the down@@ side effects is defined after the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks entered with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , a total lower incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ing and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7,3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % were obtained under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % were treated with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
Man@@ ic episodes on Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order - in a controlled trial of 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS rose to 26,@@ 6 % in patients , under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo was treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol and placebo in which potenti@@ ally significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , showed no medical significant differences .
elev@@ ations of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asym@@ pt@@ om@@ inations were observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol treated patients , compared to 2.0 % of placebo @-@ treated patients .

in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or re@@ vers@@ al ac@@ ute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated dos@@ es of up to 1260 mg and without deaths .
though there is no information about the effic@@ acy of an hem@@ odi@@ alys@@ is in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol ; however , it is in@@ prob@@ able that her@@ ed@@ itary analysis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , since Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol has a high plas@@ map@@ le binding .
it is believed that the effic@@ acy of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect is used .
Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recept@@ or and an excellent aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , to alpha @-@ 1 ad@@ ren@@ to and to the Hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled trial , 52 of the proportion of Respon@@ si@@ bilities , who contributed to the study medication , both similar to the study medication ( Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measuring sk@@ alen , defined as secondary students , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ ine , Dep@@ res@@ sive transfer rates , showed significant improvement as in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia was significantly higher reduction in response rate , representing 34 % in Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol Group and 57 % at placebo .
in a Ol@@ on@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , mult@@ in@@ ational dual @-@ blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia was over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included in significantly fewer patients with significantly fewer patients with significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of about 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dose over 3 weeks with a man@@ or or mixed epis@@ ode of the Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order showed Ari@@ c@@ raz@@ ol to placebo over a placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study more than 3 weeks with fixed dosage in patients with a man@@ or or mixed epis@@ ode of the Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order showed Ari@@ c@@ raz@@ ol to placebo any superior effec@@ tiveness .
in two pl@@ ace@@ ents and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ or or mixed epis@@ ode of a Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order , Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol showed a compar@@ atively superior effec@@ tiveness in week 3 and a reduction effects , which was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol also proved to a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of Man@@ ia such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with a man@@ or or mixed epis@@ ode of a Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order , with or without psych@@ otic features , the conc@@ ept@@ ing therapy with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol has revealed a superior effec@@ tiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .

the effic@@ acy of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a study study at 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters were before a anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in some gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treated patients receiving treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients with conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el are included .
considered only the patient who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between the disease and survival of disease and survival between the medication .
in contrast , in patients who received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ es more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also be used to be used in patients , st@@ oves , or before the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ic figures in the blood .
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ators ( CH@@ MP ) established that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane contained in patients with which the first treatment cannot be more efficient than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el using other medicines to decrease side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Ab@@ ra@@ xis Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited a approval for the transport of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients , with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ rac@@ et@@ y@@ cl@@ in therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ is &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y during Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
at sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y grade 3 the treatment should be interrup@@ ted , until a improvement of degree 1 or 2 is achieved , and at all subsequent cycles must be reduced .
there are currently no stri@@ pping data for the recommendation of dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in patients with mild to negative imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with imp@@ aired cardi@@ ac function and there are currently no real data for the recommendation of dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ compliance data on the effec@@ tiveness and effec@@ tiveness .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic form@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which might be considerably other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allerg@@ ic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients , no ren@@ ew treatment cycles should be adjusted to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the t@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ du@@ cks has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with serious liver function ( bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / ALT &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
during a unique with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in connection , kar@@ di@@ otox@@ icity was not detected , kar@@ di@@ ale incid@@ ents in the indi@@ genous patients were un@@ usually un@@ usually , especially in patients with former anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in treatment or in the lap of cardi@@ ac disease or lung disease .
in case of patients suffering from Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ et@@ ika and constant funds .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane should not be practi@@ ced in pregnant women or women in vain , not to be applied , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is not possible .
women in high @-@ age age should be able to apply a reliable distribution method for up to 1 month after the treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
Male patients who are treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , will be challeng@@ ed while taking up to six months after the treatment no child bear witness .
Male patient should be used before treatment over a sper@@ ity preserv@@ ation , since the therapy with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane can cause any side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and sw@@ ing@@ arm ( common ) , which can operate on the traffic and ability to serve machines .
following the following are the most frequently and most important incid@@ ents are listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the piv@@ ot@@ al clinical Phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most remarkable important risk of tox@@ icity ( with 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly rever@@ si@@ bly and dos@@ es ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients and was serious ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the ad@@ verse events are listed in conjunction with the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy at every dose and indication in studies ( N = 789 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .

since these events were reported on volun@@ tary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible , and there was no more serious connection with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli drug which promot@@ es the storage of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli and stabil@@ ized the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ or@@ isation .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ge network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ ot@@ hic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells con@@ medi@@ ated in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies revealed that the presence of Alb@@ lit@@ ax@@ el supports the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells by the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ rec@@ ep@@ tic is used and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein P@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is treated by data of 106 patients in two influ@@ enced studies and 454 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparison study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer is treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 used as an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with prevention of allerg@@ ic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in form of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a affected general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al met@@ ast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ ible cells .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy alone , 27 % had only one ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy alone , 40 % due to met@@ ast@@ feeding and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ asia and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to pro@@ gression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who received the &gt; First @-@ Line therapy , are shown below .
ne@@ ur@@ otox@@ icity of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy a periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y Grad 3 was evaluated .
the natural development of periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y on bas@@ eline due to accum@@ ul@@ ative tox@@ icity of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment course has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ingredients ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 167@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 A intra@@ ven@@ ous gift from Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took up the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration on multi@@ ph@@ ous manner .
the middle distribution volume was 632 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ular distribution and / or soft connection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced soli@@ ds , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic characteristics of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of sol@@ vent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human liver mic@@ ros@@ ome and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily associated with 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of met@@ abol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
in the age of more than 75 years , only few data are available , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic analysis .

• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the medication ( technical information ) , lab@@ elling and packing included . • With unique image of the correct use of the product , cooling systems for transport through the patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed of biological medic@@ inal is similar to the European Union ( EU ) and the same active ingre@@ dient ( also called &quot; reference ar@@ z@@ bow &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood glucose values in which , in connection with blood trans@@ f@@ usion comp@@ lications , if surgery is not possible to expect a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be di@@ ver@@ ified under the supervision of a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which is indicated for the medicine .
in patients with cardi@@ oid problems and patients who want to take a blood ble@@ eding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a V@@ ene .
injection can also be done by the patient or its car@@ cass@@ er@@ son , if they have a reasonable manual .
in patients with chronic cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency or patients who received chemotherapy should always be observed in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per year with adult or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the iron values of all patients are control before treatment to ensure that no ir@@ rig@@ ging resistance should be administ@@ ered during the treatment during the treatment .
in patients receiving a chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , a an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel , or thereby the body does not suff@@ ice to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in .

it is produced by a cell which has been brought into a gene ( DNA ) , which she is used for the formation of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed when injection was compared to a v@@ ene in a study of a main study with 479 patients , compared to one of cardi@@ oid problems , compared to the reference rate of reference .
all of the study participating patients was at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected before they were converted either on Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to E@@ pre@@ x / er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es between the beginning of the study and the general period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study , in which the effects of influ@@ ential Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were investigated by 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who were caused by a cardi@@ oid problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds of patients were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed as in case of those patients who continue to continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase of blood pressure , the occasionally to symptoms of an enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy ( ep@@ n@@ probl@@ eme ) like su@@ dden , steep and mig@@ rant he@@ ada@@ ches and conf@@ usion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed can not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended for treatment of cardi@@ oid problems , since further studies are necessary to ensure that there is no allerg@@ ic reactions .
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ators ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that , in accordance with the regulations of the European Union to demonstrate that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and effects profile like E@@ pre@@ x / er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed is created , will provide information on security personnel in all member states , including information about safety of medicines .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the Medi@@ ce pharmac@@ euticals Division P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , approved for the domestic transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .

in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administ@@ ered dose in the ur@@ ine , while the rest is primarily bound to bone tissue .
the total clearing Clear@@ ance is independent of 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , bre@@ ed or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ s@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearing from cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems met@@ abol@@ ised substances is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abol@@ ised , because they are a weak or even direct or / or ir@@ reversible , raw dependent inhibit@@ or of P@@ 450@@ -

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public reve@@ als the present document is a summary of the European Public Research Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained by the committee for Human@@ ar@@ z@@ ler ( CH@@ MP ) to get through recommendations regarding the application of medication .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ sized patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abet@@ ic medicine ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with other di@@ abet@@ ic medicine ( dual therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ exposed patients ) , which can not be adjusted in met@@ form@@ ations in the highest toler@@ able dosage .
in combination with an sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ine or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ity , or ins@@ ulin can be ret@@ ained , except in patients with hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ates or the ins@@ ulin can be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin is better @-@ weigh@@ ted and the blood sugar level gets better , reducing the type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the effic@@ acy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy was investigated ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ine , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ lier@@ tes hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how good blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lo@@ wering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which indicates that the blood glucose levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ine in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values around 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift from placebo to a decrease of 0.35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was investigated in 289 patients , in addition to ins@@ ulin , a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who received placebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were tend@@ encies , inf@@ ections of the upper air@@ ways ( cold cuts ) , weight loss and hy@@ po@@ aest@@ hes@@ ia ( di@@ min@@ ished sensitivity compared to fri@@ ction ) .
account of Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients , possibly more sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or di@@ abet@@ ic c@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ osis ( high ket@@ ones - acid levels - blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos is used in a mon@@ otherapy ( with the all@@ few use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , which is not displayed .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the European Commission to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until white , round , curved and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with ulin @-@ ins@@ ular patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar with ins@@ ulin had in@@ adequate or in@@ compati@@ bles ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years are no data available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ous cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease ) , the doctor may start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight increasing or eyel@@ ids be observed , especially those with reduced kar@@ di@@ aler reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight increasing and eyel@@ ids be observed when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardi@@ ov@@ ascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , and pre @-@ advanced ordinary activities were carried out .
in this study , an increase of reports of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency , however , showed up to an increase of mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased resolution liver cells ( ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of standard range ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used .
if the ALT @-@ Spiegel are increased to 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of normal range , the liver cells are so soon as soon as possible .
if a patient have developed symptoms , which refer to a hep@@ atic d@@ ys@@ function , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ ex@@ emp@@ ti@@ bility , fatigue , app@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ ents .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the procedure will be di@@ ver@@ ified by clinical trials .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight increase , which can touch of fat deposits and is connected in some cases with fluid head .
as a result of a group mod@@ el@@ ution under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a less reduction in mean hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ oph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ine and in@@ sul@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ b@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased In@@ sul@@ in@@ sens@@ ation in patients who received Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral dual or triple @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ es dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the launch of the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ din@@ di@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , an inc@@ ing or a loss of di@@ abet@@ ic mac@@ ular de@@ ems with a loss of visual acu@@ ity reports .
it is un@@ clear whether it is between taking place of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ular o@@ eu@@ dem@@ ons , however , should be aware of a mac@@ ular declaration of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ olog@@ ic agreement should be considered to be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events with regard to bone breaks out of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
the calculated Group @-@ correction was 1.9 fre@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient years with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fre@@ igh@@ ters for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ active study , a study of cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fre@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient years ) who treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 cargo cultures per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
the patient should be aware of the ability to be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient could wish or that occurs , the treatment is ab@@ using ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for research effects have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmac@@ odynam@@ ics from Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .

if the har@@ bor mirror is still more than 6 m@@ g. per year , the dose may be increased to 120 mg each day .
during the first treatment course , we are still occur during the first treatment courses ; therefore we recommend patients at least during the first six months in treatment with Aden@@ u@@ ric yet another drug for the prevention of gyp@@ si@@ es .
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had a tran@@ splant@@ ation , since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effec@@ tiveness of three different Aden@@ u@@ ric dos@@ es ( once daily 80 , 120 , and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( an additional medicine ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medic@@ inal product to the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ ous ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ es of Aden@@ u@@ ric ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 762 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with cardi@@ oid problems only received 100 mg per day .
the main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients whose har@@ ns@@ acid mirror was under 6 mg / dl in the blood of the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients receiving Aden@@ u@@ ric in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) who attended once daily 120 mg of patients who once had a har@@ p@@ ic mirror in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients conducted by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no one of the 134 patients with placebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Aden@@ u@@ ric ( observed in 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea and abnormal liver levels .
especially in patients with heart symptoms in pre@@ historic history , possibly a increased risk of ad@@ verse events that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ators ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that Aden@@ u@@ ric was more effective in the lo@@ wering of the har@@ ns@@ acid mirror , but also a higher risk of ad@@ verse events in connection with the heart and blood vessels .

the lo@@ wering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ acid mirror at &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed at the doctor visit in week 2 , lasting over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with cardi@@ oid restri@@ ction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effic@@ acy of 40 patients with cardi@@ oid restri@@ ction ( d. H ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary effic@@ acy point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients reached .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ acid concentrations in subjects , un@@ counted of its kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with serious cardi@@ ac inter@@ ference ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and FAC@@ T study together ) had a ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
in two years , data from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent ste@@ aring of ser@@ um vit@@ rified is revealed to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mol / l ) in the months 16 @-@ 24 patients ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed any treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) .
this was associated with a reduction of gyp@@ sum size , which results in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the pl@@ ough@@ s up to the month 24 .
enhanced TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used to treat ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are bre@@ ast@@ y ) for women after men@@ op@@ ause , which consists of a risk of low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before meals , drink or need of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ ant ) .
in order to avoid a fri@@ ction of the feeding tube , the patient may take place until after the first food intake of the day , the ear@@ liest after 30 minutes after taking the tablet shall not go .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 already separated from each other in medicines referred to in the European Union , the company presented data before , which come from previous studies and published literature .
the company also resulted in a study with 35 men and 682 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis , to increase the effec@@ tiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in terms of the increase of vitamin D @-@ axis .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with a lower vitamin D mirror was treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those that took only Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also laid data on data that in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE included al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose exactly the dose , which is required for the change of a bone loss .
the most common ad@@ verse events ( observed in 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ che , pain of movement ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ion appar@@ atus such as dom@@ inal pain , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( blo@@ ws ) , cre@@ di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( blo@@ od@@ stu@@ ff@@ ed ) , sin@@ cer@@ es ab@@ d@@ omen ( blo@@ od@@ stu@@ ff@@ ed belly ) as well as Sau@@ res up@@ swing .
in patients with et@@ wa@@ al sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied .
it is not used as dis@@ orders of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low levels of calcium mirror ) or patients who can &apos;t be able to sit in at least 30 minutes .
Janu@@ ar@@ y@@ 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a approval for the domestic transport of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
cap@@ s@@ ular , white until broken white tablets , marked with the tear of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or use of medicines ( including Ant@@ az@@ ida , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) for the day .
the following references are to follow to reduce the risk of mal@@ oph@@ ag@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is supposed to be c@@ ased in the mouth only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not be broken into the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patient should not be taken before taking the first food intake at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ ept@@ isches Ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical procedure , excluding p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ ics , only under particular invent@@ ories ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ oph@@ ag@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a and mal@@ oph@@ ag@@ ale conqu@@ ering , rarely followed by mal@@ oph@@ ag@@ alen cor@@ k@@ tures were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( some were these heav@@ enly and necessary hospital ) .
the doctor should therefore be careful attention to all the signs and symptoms that are pointed out on possible mal@@ oph@@ ag@@ al reactions such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in the sli@@ der or retro@@ f@@ ular pain or a new or wor@@ m@@ ive he@@ art@@ burn ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of the risk of severe ad@@ verse events seems to be increased in patients that should not take the medicine and / or after the appearance of symptoms which take on a mal@@ oph@@ ag@@ ale Ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing can be applied to the patient and will be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
during large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after the market ) Mag@@ en- and Du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some heav@@ iness and comp@@ lications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available , the indic@@ ations of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who di@@ min@@ ished a k@@ ie@@ ved surgical procedure that reduces the risk of ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ ar of the j@@ aw .
clinical assessment by treatments is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefits @-@ risk assessment .
patients have to be demonstrated that when taking part of a dose AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE the tablet should be taken at the next morning , after they have noticed their re@@ conc@@ eption .
you should not take two tablets at the same day , but the intake of one tablet per week as planned planned for the planned day of the week .
other diseases associated with the mineral changes ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated before the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale drugs can be affected by al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if it be taken at the same time .
therefore , those patients have to wait for at least 30 minutes before deduc@@ ting other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together in clinical trials with a variety of ordinary medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is intended only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not able to use women during pregnancy .
animal study with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at do not have a h@@ int on direct damage in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ rose from the Kie@@ fers was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ atas ; most reports are from cancer patients , however , was also reported in ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ ep@@ tics .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um concentration of the ser@@ um calcium is up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mol / l ) and the ser@@ um - phosph@@ ate up to 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mol / l ) in both treatment groups with similar incidence .

Res@@ or@@ ption Be@@ ing at a intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was increased from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at women 0.@@ 64 % for dos@@ es between 5 and 70 mg after a closer fast@@ ing and two hours before recording of a standardi@@ zed break@@ fast@@ s .
the bio@@ availability decreased to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate one or half an hour before a standardi@@ zed breakfast was taken .
in ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ est@@ u@@ est@@ u@@ dia , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drinking the day .
in healthy subjects brought the gift from oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) to no clin@@ ically significant change in or@@ bit@@ ration ( increase in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is divided by intra@@ ven@@ ous gift from 1 mg / kg tempor@@ arily distributed in sof@@ tened beings , but then spread quickly in the bones or out of the ur@@ ine .
dis@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was found within 72 hours with the ur@@ ine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the threads .
according to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and system@@ ic clearing has exceeded 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at will not be di@@ vor@@ ced via the aci@@ dic or basic transport system of kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that it influ@@ enced by other medicines through this transport systems .

the effec@@ tiveness of the effic@@ acy was the number of patients suffering from tran@@ spl@@ ants after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , how often a re@@ medi@@ al tran@@ spl@@ ant or a re@@ recording of di@@ alys@@ is needed ) .
in addition , more recent studies were carried out in 119 patients with kidney tran@@ splant@@ ation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant and analys@@ ed such as Adv@@ ant@@ raf compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors who tru@@ sted with immun@@ oph@@ onic therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ants , ought to use this medicine or changes in the imm@@ unity therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ant ab@@ normal@@ ities or increased incidence of ad@@ verse events , including lower or over@@ l@@ ors .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and corresponding to the daily dosage ; provisions of form@@ ulation or reg@@ imes should only be made under the eng@@ aging of the medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a result of an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic approach monitoring and corresponding dos@@ es must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic ex@@ position of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will remain .
the Adv@@ ant@@ raf dosage should be based on clinical assessment of abstr@@ acts and toler@@ ability in individual and to blood levels ( see below . )
after the completion of Pro@@ gra@@ f at Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley should be controlled before the delivery and over two weeks after completion .
in day 4 , the system@@ ic ex@@ position was measured as a tal@@ ent mirror , with both form@@ ul@@ ative and both form@@ ul@@ ators as well as in le@@ ber@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant patients .
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels are recommended during the first two weeks after Tran@@ splant@@ ation under Adv@@ ant@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , a adap@@ ting of Adv@@ antage Dos@@ is@@ sch@@ em@@ as may take several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached .

duration of the application for reduction of tran@@ spl@@ ants must be det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated ; the immun@@ o@@ deficiency must not be noted , thus a maximum duration of the therapy is not specified .
dose recommendations - kidney tran@@ splant@@ ation proph@@ yl@@ axis of tran@@ spl@@ ant therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose custom@@ iz@@ ations can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us change in the course of stabil@@ isation in patients after Tran@@ splant@@ ation .
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ splant@@ ation proph@@ yl@@ axis of Tran@@ splant@@ ation therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
Dos@@ age Recomm@@ end@@ ation - Con@@ version of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf must be converted from a daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf , this conversion rate has a daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ splant@@ ation After a change@@ over of other immun@@ o@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ ant@@ raf once daily must start treatment with kidney disease and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant initi@@ als for proph@@ yl@@ axis of tran@@ spl@@ ants .
cardi@@ ac tran@@ spl@@ ants in adult patients who will be converted to Adv@@ ag@@ raf is an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day a day .
other tran@@ spl@@ ants are probably no clinical experience with Adv@@ antage for lung cancer , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ m@@ tran@@ spl@@ ants patients in an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with int@@ est@@ inal initi@@ atives in an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in specific patient groups patients with limited liver function , ir@@ rig@@ ation of blood cells in the an@@ gest@@ ive range can be necessary in patients with serious liver function .
patients with in@@ numer@@ able kidney function , the kidney function cannot be exercis@@ ed on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose custom@@ ization is not required .
however , due to the Nep@@ al@@ otox@@ ic Pot@@ enti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , a careful monitoring of the cardi@@ oid ( including a regular determination of ser@@ ad@@ or@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ spiegel , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ ar@@ ance and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .

recommendations to the view mirror in the whole blood of the whole blood should be based on clinical assessment of abstr@@ act and toler@@ ability in individual relief from whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley view mirror .
it is recommended common inspec@@ tions of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley view during the first two weeks after Tran@@ splant@@ ation , followed by peri@@ odi@@ cal controls during the maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ view mirror of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be used to change from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , changes of immune therapy , or equivalent of subst@@ rates that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) .
because Adv@@ ant@@ raf is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjust@@ ments of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies concl@@ ude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the dam is not exceed the blood of the blood 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the talks of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us occur in the whole blood in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ants in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for canc@@ el and warm @-@ spl@@ ant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac ab@@ normal@@ ities were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to severe ad@@ verse events , including Tran@@ splant@@ ation or other side effects , which can occur in the epis@@ ode of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and corresponding to the daily dosage ; provisions of form@@ ulation or reg@@ imes should only be performed under the eng@@ aging of the medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ splant@@ ation , which were proved to other immun@@ o@@ res@@ si@@ va as treatment of therapy , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ained form@@ ulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
the proph@@ yl@@ axis of tran@@ spl@@ ants with adult tran@@ spl@@ ants and tran@@ spl@@ ants have no clinical data for the ret@@ ained form@@ ulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
due to possible exchange @-@ effects , which lead to the tac@@ kling cell levels in blood and a atten@@ u@@ ation of clinical effect of tac@@ kling cells ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant healing during a treatment with Adv@@ antage ( see section 4.5 ) .

simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines that are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the met@@ abol@@ ism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is recommended that the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ cul@@ um levels is recommended to change the CY@@ P@@ 3A met@@ abol@@ ism , to monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A met@@ abol@@ ism , to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

if the expected factor VIII &apos;s plasma activities does not be achieved or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary , if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ or values , it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weigh@@ ted .
the appointment rate should be addressed after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication during treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .

based on the first release of the data , CH@@ MP has continued its benefits if the CH@@ MP has continued to be positive as a positive result , but otherwise stated that safety profile dis@@ monit@@ ored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the basis of the AD@@ VA@@ TE , which makes a sub@@ mitt@@ ing PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months , decided that the author@@ isation holder will be applied for another 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited was officially approved by the Committee on Human@@ ar@@ z@@ ler ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company will take its application for the domestic transport of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue , the other structures in the body connects and supports rest ) .
this is a kind of virus , the gen@@ et@@ ically transformed that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ ovirus , &quot; that was so modified , that there is no copies of himself and can &apos;t solve inf@@ ections with human beings .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein which is made from the not def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , is normally cor@@ rupt the recovery of cor@@ rupt DNA and to kill the cells , if the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , while the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not really properly , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share .
the company laid data from a study with a patient before , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ water , in the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP respon@@ ses to the company &apos;s respon@@ ses to the answers , were still un@@ explained some questions un@@ explained .
based on testing the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP submitted a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP section , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ours was advantages for the patient .
the committee also had concerns relating to the processing of medication in the body , the administration of administration and safety of medicines .
in addition , the company did not work enough that adv@@ ise it in reliable way , and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come into contact with the patient , harm@@ ful .
the company provided the CH@@ MP of which in knowledge if the withdraw@@ al consequences for patients who currently has to participate in clinical trials , or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; the active effect of active index means that the tablets are so cle@@ ared , that one of the most effective ingredients are immediately released , and the other slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is applied for the treatment of symptoms of se@@ asonal @-@ allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis ( tu@@ b@@ ular inflamm@@ ation of n@@ ollen ) in patients with nose @-@ skin irrit@@ ation ( cor@@ rupt nose ) .
for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents from 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ ina@@ ze twice daily to be a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the treatment duration should be as short as possible and fin@@ ishes , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose jew@@ els ( ver@@ ge nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of medication should be neg@@ lec@@ ted on the development of the nose .
the main current dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the Heus@@ chn@@ u@@ pf@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome which were reported by the patient before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
while the study carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a di@@ ary and evaluated using a standard scale , as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
for cont@@ empl@@ ation of all Heus@@ chn@@ u@@ pf@@ ym@@ pt@@ oms apart from the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported that Aer@@ ina@@ ze participated , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in patients who received the pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nose was viewed , the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in patients receiving the Des@@ k@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Aer@@ ina@@ ze ( wat@@ ched with 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) , th@@ um@@ ber , psych@@ ot@@ itis ( appet@@ ite ) , const@@ ip@@ ation , he@@ ada@@ che , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nie ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep dis@@ orders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze may be sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against Des@@ k@@ at@@ adin , pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for the treatment of aller@@ gi@@ es ) are not used .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze may also be applied in patients who suffer from a engag@@ angle glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular disease , hyper@@ th@@ y@@ re@@ ose ( over@@ function of th@@ y@@ ro@@ id arthritis ) , or already had a bri@@ gh@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a brain ble@@ eding ) or have a risk of inc@@ iner@@ tia .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval for the transport of Aer@@ ina@@ ze on the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is immer@@ sed in the bugs ( i.e. without them to break or to@@ wing ) .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should be used due to the absence of data on the effec@@ tiveness and effec@@ tiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) are not used in children under 12 years .
the application of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after waste of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since the term application of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine can take off at the time .
after the decline in the grinding of the mu@@ c@@ ate in the upper re@@ spir@@ atory , the treatment should be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin than Mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ ina@@ ze pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine contains the medicine also con@@ fer@@ ous in patients who treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or will be treated within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combination with pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ u@@ rid , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , Di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Ep@@ hedr@@ ine , Oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , N@@ aph@@ az@@ olin ... ) .
the safety and effic@@ acy of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective , and the data will not submit to the recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and effic@@ acy of Aer@@ ina@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , not checked , to transfer the recommendations to the dosage .
the patients must notify me that the treatment is treated with hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ rom@@ kar@@ le or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ic symptoms ( such as he@@ ada@@ ches or an ampli@@ fication of he@@ ada@@ ches ) .
in the treatment of the following patients group : • Pati@@ ents under Digit@@ alis • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension , patients with hyper@@ tension , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder cancer or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ ese .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of mat@@ ological tests , since Anti@@ hist@@ amines , otherwise positive reactions to indicators for skin reaction and reduce their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ k@@ at@@ adin , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administ@@ ered , however , no clin@@ ically important currency effects or changes of Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation was observed .
in case of the psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic tests , no significant differences were detected between Des@@ k@@ ate and placebo in placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ k@@ ate adin alone or alcohol was taken .
this enzyme responsible for the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ k@@ at@@ adin was not identified , so that interaction with other drugs cannot be excluded .
Des@@ k@@ at@@ adin shirt in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a subst@@ rate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
the imp@@ lies of the use of Aer@@ ina@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ anci@@ es but no increasing the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the incidence of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies of animals are not always applied to humans and transferred to humans of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine , Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , the patients should be clar@@ ified that it may occur in very rare cases to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS de@@ pression ( Se@@ coding , Ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ min@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , cardi@@ ov@@ ascular Coll@@ ap@@ se ) and a Z@@ NS @-@ stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a Z@@ NS @-@ stim@@ ulation is especially likely to be most likely , as well as A@@ tro@@ pin typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ piece , pup@@ il z@@ arre and dil@@ at@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ therm@@ ia and gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of inflamm@@ atory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stic cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as inhibit@@ ing expression of the expression of the ad@@ mir@@ ation of P @-@ p@@ ect@@ in on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
at a single dose study with adults showed Des@@ k@@ at@@ adin 5 mg , no influence on standard measurement variables of the aviation power including the rein@@ for@@ cing sub@@ j@@ ective bats or the tasks that are connected with the flies .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg , no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo was determined .
the or@@ ale application of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause more symp@@ ath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ ar@@ kar@@ ous or Manif@@ est@@ ations of a Z@@ NS @-@ exc@@ itation .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients in the age between 12 and 78 years with se@@ asonal @-@ allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis , whereby 414 patients received Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist effec@@ tiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets , determined using the total value for symp@@ tom ( except Nas@@ en@@ mu@@ en@@ skin ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effec@@ tiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the weak@@ ening effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effec@@ tiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic methods .
as part of a single dose @-@ study of Pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Aer@@ ina@@ ze is Des@@ k@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ ina@@ ze in healthy volunteers with 14 days the flow of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
in the context of an pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ sic study , which was performed with the form@@ ulation of a healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects Des@@ k@@ ate adin bad conf@@ used .
a components of Inter@@ action study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine in the all@@ couple of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine was equivalent to exposure of a Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies for safety har@@ ass@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in re@@ trac@@ ting gift , for gen@@ otox@@ icity and re@@ productive aggreg@@ ate the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ k@@ ate , however no special danger will be recogni@@ z@@ able for the human beings .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents with allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies at se@@ asonal allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who had also examined ast@@ h@@ ma ) .
the effic@@ acy was measured by changing the change of symptoms ( Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , number and size of squares , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleeping and performance in days ) and after six months of therapy .
further studies were submitted to transfer the sy@@ rup , the solution to take the sy@@ rup , the solution for entering and the use of the same manner as tablets and use of children un@@ think@@ able .
in allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies have taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symp@@ tom ( symptoms of symp@@ tom ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ ti@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms after six months of therapy with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo was treated with placebo and 33 % compared to placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who possibly have been sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against Des@@ k@@ ate adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval for the inter@@ course of A@@ eri@@ us to the European Union .

there are limited experience from clinical trials to the effec@@ tiveness of Des@@ k@@ at@@ adin in adol@@ esc@@ ents aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms of less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be obtained according to the previous illness and can be termin@@ ated after the course of the symptoms and their re@@ occur .
persist@@ ent allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to the patient during everyday life time .
clin@@ ically important inter@@ actions were not found in the clinical studies with Des@@ k@@ ate adin tablets not found , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administ@@ ered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in an clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study at the equivalent taking of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the most efficient effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see section 5.1 ) .

clinical studies in various indic@@ ations , including allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opat@@ hic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more ad@@ verse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us to patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events were reported to placebo over the common side effects , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) and he@@ ada@@ che ( 0.8 % ) and he@@ ada@@ che ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with the 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common secondary he@@ ada@@ che has been treated with 5.9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( ninth clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically important effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of inflamm@@ atory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stic cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as inhibit@@ ing expression of the expression of the ad@@ mir@@ ation of P @-@ p@@ ect@@ in on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. is officially approved by the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company will bring his application for the domestic transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used by adults and older people for protection against influ@@ enza , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that may cause a trunk of influ@@ enza which may cause a future p@@ andem@@ ic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ andem@@ ic breaks out , when a new trunk of flu virus is di@@ pped , which can be slightly increased from man , because the people still have no immune system ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the vacc@@ ine contained in the vacc@@ ine contained in the vacc@@ ine .
this makes the immune system later in the position , with a contact with a flu virus like an influ@@ ential anti@@ bodies .
afterwards , the reed valve of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the mem@@ bran@@ es , which det@@ ects the human body as physical foreign ) , clean@@ ed and as an component of the vacc@@ ine is used .
some of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thereby , the scope of clinical data base for the evalu@@ ating safety of the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre@@ p@@ andem@@ ic vacc@@ ines .
should you need to participate in clinical examination and further information about your treatment , please contact your treatments doctor .
if you want more information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are caused by the immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t kill the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase can be taken as a solution for a solution , but it can &apos;t be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir because the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be assigned , if the doctor has checked , which has taken an an@@ tivir@@ al drug in the patient previously , and the prob@@ ability has judged that the virus is talking to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and other an@@ tivir@@ al medication .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase after body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces HIV @-@ quantity in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medication in blood and keep them on a low level .
Aids is not too he@@ al , however , the creation of the immune system , and hence the development of AIDS linked inf@@ ections and dis@@ orders .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicine , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , in two main studies with 736 HIV @-@ infected adults who were previously treated with prot@@ ease of liqu@@ ids .
that with low dose of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir reinforced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had previously taken the earlier prot@@ ease of protein .
the main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV in blood ( vir@@ al load ) or the change in vir@@ al load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease earlier , after 48 weeks , more patients had a vir@@ al load below 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ av@@ ir .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ al load , but with the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease earlier than just a few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated previously treated with Prot@@ ected fi@@ brill@@ ation , using R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir enhanced medicines A@@ generate the vir@@ al load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir to a stronger waste of the vir@@ al load after four weeks in patients who continued to further previous prot@@ ease earlier :
the most common ad@@ verse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ che , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( blo@@ ws ) , Flat@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and cat@@ tery ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used to be used in patients , Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal compound for the treatment of de@@ pression ) or drugs , which are the same as A@@ gener@@ ase and are in high concentrations in blood @-@ harm@@ ful .
like with other medicines against HIV exists , the risk of a Lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an ost@@ e@@ onic disease ( symptoms of an infection that caused by changing the immune system ) .
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ators ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir but the committee held that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in patients who had previously not demonstrated proteins .
A@@ gener@@ ase was supposed to be admitted under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission approved the Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited a approval for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication for treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for this , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules of Pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ir can be administ@@ ered with low dos@@ es of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir should be taking into consider@@ ation of the individual vir@@ al resistance and treatment of the patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the Bi@@ over@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as a solution for entry is 14 % lower than of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir than capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for entry to a milli@@ grams of a milli@@ gram basis is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir twice daily together with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fication of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( Boo@@ adding ) , must be applied higher dos@@ es to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics , effic@@ acy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low dos@@ es of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir or other protein types were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data on the integr@@ ity and effec@@ tiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic data , the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with a serious liver function on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with serious liver function .
simultaneous use in patients with mild or similar liver function is done with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver function , it is imp@@ acted ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines to have a small therapeutic width and also subst@@ rate of cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
veget@@ al preparations , the cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to risk of reducing plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effects of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir during taking of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to healing the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic inf@@ ections or other comp@@ lications of a HIV infection .
the present @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prev@@ ents the risk of a transfer of HIV on other by sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with low dos@@ es of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication used ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have a increased risk of serious liver ab@@ normal@@ ities with potenti@@ ally f@@ atal course .
for the case of an con@@ current an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C please read the care information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ limited liver function , including a chronic active ingre@@ dient , an increased frequency of liver functional problems under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monit@@ ored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glucose sy@@ o@@ ids , it is not recommended that the possible benefits of treatment system@@ ic corne@@ al cor@@ ruption including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the in@@ ni@@ otic function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the explo@@ itation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is dependent on A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the increased risk of My@@ opat@@ hi@@ es including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen is not recommended .
4 For some drugs , which may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International standardi@@ zed ratio ) , methods to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of the plasma level of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abol@@ ish inter@@ actions with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , the effic@@ acy of hormon@@ al cont@@ radi@@ os can be changed , however , the information can &apos;t be sufficient to estimate the type of interaction .
if Meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , the patient should therefore be monit@@ ored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome , especially in addition to low dos@@ es of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ag@@ yl value of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for example , this vari@@ ation form of children under an age of four years was used and should be used with cau@@ tion in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set up to 5 , if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allerg@@ ic symptoms , or the v@@ eil are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an existing type of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases associated to whose therapy were necessary to be associated with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drugs - dependent factors such as a longer and@@ au@@ ern@@ de anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated to associated met@@ abolic dis@@ orders .
in st@@ em@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ ease fi@@ brill@@ ation , reports on an increase of ble@@ eding including spont@@ aneous k@@ ut@@ ans Ha@@ em@@ ome and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ def@@ ect , in order to develop an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory or resi@@ du@@ al opport@@ un@@ istic inf@@ ections , which leads to severe clinical trials , or det@@ eri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a Multi@@ fact@@ orial offices are accepted ( including use of Kor@@ tik@@ ov@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , serious immun@@ o@@ ids , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , were reported in particular patient with advanced HIV @-@ condition and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 subst@@ rate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs , which have a small therapeutic width and also subst@@ rate of cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D6 subst@@ rates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir may not be used together with medicines , which are mainly connected to CY@@ P2@@ D6 and are linked to the increased plasma level with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ ig@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C caused by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
in an attempt to balance the plasma level of other protein @-@ inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir we have been observed very often un@@ wanted effects of the liver .
&apos;S W@@ ORT ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir can be re@@ hydr@@ ated by simultaneous use of vegetable preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking of Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir@@ is mirror , and if possible , vir@@ al load to ver@@ ify the vir@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dose custom@@ ization for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ av@@ ir is given along with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see also E@@ fav@@ or@@ ence below ) .
508 % increases for C@@ max contrast by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
in clinical trials , dos@@ es of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir has been used twice daily and r@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg twice daily , giving the effec@@ tiveness and in@@ fertil@@ ity of this treatment sch@@ em@@ at@@ ase .
52 % increase if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in plasma , which have been achieved in combination with am@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended that this combination is not known , because the effec@@ tiveness and in@@ firm@@ ity of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study for use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended , however , due to the ant@@ az@@ ides component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase lies at least one hour ( see Ant@@ az@@ ida below ) .
therefore at the gift of E@@ igh@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose custom@@ ization is required .
the treatment with E@@ fav@@ or@@ ence in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ av@@ ir is not recommended , because the ex@@ position of both proteins was serious .
the effect of Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing data can be avo@@ ided that Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ ine may possibly be reduced by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
if this drug should be used simultaneously , cau@@ tion is commanded , since Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level could be less effective .
when this product is used together , cau@@ tion is commanded ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be performed , since an exact forecast of the combination of am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma concentration of 193 % and thus a rise of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in connected side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is needed to increase the dosage of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , however , the plasma level could be increased in the case of the current administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir , with 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase of C@@ max K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily in comparison to 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
other medicines will be listed below , including subst@@ rates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to exchange impact .
patients should therefore be associated with toxic reactions to be monit@@ ored with these drugs , if they are applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids can &apos;t be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can be dis@@ orders .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ vul@@ ner@@ va which are known as enz@@ ym@@ ents ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir can lead to a reduction of plasma welding .
the ser@@ um concentration of calcium deposits such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , n@@ if@@ ig@@ pin , n@@ if@@ ig@@ pin , n@@ if@@ ig@@ pin , n@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase may increase Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ations with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , tend@@ encies and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the end@@ ogen@@ ous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % relative interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is not recommended that it is not recommended that the possible benefits of treatment system@@ ic corne@@ al cor@@ ds ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ de@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which is dependent on the plasma monitoring strongly of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect plasma welding at the same appointment of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma concentration of this H@@ MG Co@@ a Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opathy , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , is not recommended to use the combined application of this medicine with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
it is a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentration to stabil@@ ization of mir@@ rors , since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be applied together with oral oblig@@ atory Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using the same application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ ent Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s cau@@ tion .
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ ent Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors refer to a possible increase in plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to take 3 to 4 feet .
if Meth@@ ad@@ on is administ@@ ered with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , the patient should therefore be monit@@ ored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome , especially in addition to low dos@@ es of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
due to its low reliability of historic info , no recommendation can be given no recommendation , such as Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir dose is to adjust if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
at the same gift from War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies , together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zed ratio ) because of the ability of a atten@@ u@@ ation or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir on hormon@@ al contrast agent is not required , therefore also alternative methods for recei@@ vers is recommended .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ ypt@@ il@@ in ) is recommended at the same time equivalent of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this product may only be used as a result of possible eff@@ lu@@ ct@@ ance of possible users for the mother in comparison to the fet@@ us .
in the milk pure rats , Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir @-@ related fabri@@ cs were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir has exceeded people into breast milk .
a re@@ productive study on imp@@ aired rats that was administ@@ ered by the dis@@ arm@@ ament in the uter@@ us until the end of the St@@ ill Time Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight in post@@ age .
the further development of the post@@ age of fertil@@ ity and reproduction was not imp@@ acted by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir to the mat@@ ernity .
the integr@@ ity of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication .
most of the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment associated with ad@@ verse events were ligh@@ tly pr@@ ono@@ unced , came up early and resulted in the treatment break@@ through .
with many of these events , whether they are not clar@@ ified whether they are used in connection with treatment of A@@ gener@@ ase or another same time to HIV @-@ treatment , whether they are a result of the disease .
most of the above side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease fi@@ brill@@ ation not previously treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the test@@ ament as in connection with the study medication , and with more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as under the treatment of laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with HIV disease ( Lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and f@@ atal fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ine of bre@@ asts and dor@@ sal fat collection ( st@@ ub@@ b@@ acken ) .

in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ def@@ ect , the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can be inflamm@@ atory reaction to asym@@ pt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic inf@@ ections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily together with low dos@@ si@@ bl@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , were comparable to all aspects of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ - and CP@@ K values that were treated with low dos@@ ed r@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , very often occurred .

the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in ak@@ ut and chronic infected cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M with ak@@ ut infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic inf@@ ested cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication during people still is not defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients with the approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir dos@@ es - like with other R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir dos@@ es - the described mut@@ ations are observed only rarely observed .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ Alg@@ orith@@ m is defined as the result of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ a / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a st@@ acked ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir and a reduced prob@@ ability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
concl@@ usions on the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ u@@ ster can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to check the current intervention systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ ili@@ otyp@@ ical testing methods , analysis of clinical val@@ i@@ ju@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are applied .
firms , diagnostic resistance tests , have clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically @-@ phenom@@ enal @-@ off@@ s ( crossover points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four has reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , the genetic sample creates a certain cross @-@ resistant to R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ av@@ ir , Nel@@ fin@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ av@@ ir remains in general .
there are currently data to the cru@@ cial resistance between Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and other protein liqu@@ ids for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on the twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al resistance ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Tip@@ ran@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Tip@@ ran@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Tip@@ ran@@ av@@ ir ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
in vice vers@@ a , Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir holds his activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing insulation ; the recei@@ pt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in Isol@@ ate .

the effec@@ tiveness of the effic@@ acy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg twice daily , together with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ an ( N@@ RTI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with an PI , mainly with low @-@ dose r@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir &quot; received pre@@ st@@ ost@@ ert . &quot;
one hundred and six@@ ty @-@ six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RTI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis set the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , at a non @-@ sub @-@ level threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the effec@@ tiveness of the effic@@ acy of un@@ bo@@ xed A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV inf@@ ections at the age of 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was measured in dos@@ es of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir simultaneously ; the majority of the patients treated with PI treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Bas@@ ed on these data should be optim@@ ised with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected value of &quot; non @-@ test@@ oster@@ one &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) amounts until the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , for C@@ max contrast to 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir 12 hours after the dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous dietary intake is influ@@ enced the extent and the rate of re@@ dem@@ ption .
the apparent di@@ visible volume of about 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can close to a large distribution volume , and an un@@ covered penetration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir of the blood circulation to the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of total concentration in plasma , with the quantity of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which remains the active share , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir constantly remain constant , the percentage of percentage of free active ingredients during the dos@@ ing intervals in the Ste@@ ady state above the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ ited or a subst@@ rate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indicate if they are given to be given with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ex@@ position as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is one of the solution 14 % less bio@@ de@@ classified as of the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ meter basis .
the ren@@ al clearing of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is also neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble , therefore the effect of a cardi@@ ac disease is likely to be low to elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
this treatment sch@@ em@@ ata lead to Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir @-@ plas@@ mas@@ ks comparable to healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir twice a day without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
in long @-@ term studies for pul@@ pit and rats contributed to male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ ome at dos@@ es , who talked to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8- fold ( Rat ) of exposure of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , they said .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emer@@ gence of hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ omas was still not clar@@ ified and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for men is un@@ clear .
from the present ex@@ position data on people , both of clinical trials and from therapeutic use , however , little tips for the assum@@ ption of clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ otox@@ icity tests , the bacter@@ ial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ l@@ ymph@@ oma testing , micro@@ core test to rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation test to human periph@@ eral l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes was administ@@ ered to al@@ au@@ av@@ ir or mut@@ ual .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monit@@ ored in clinical development by AST , ALT and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , in clinical trials , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients were observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase was still observed after the end of treatment .
studies for tox@@ icity in young , who treated at an age of 4 days were treated both at the control and with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir @-@ treated animals .
in a system@@ ic plasma position , significantly higher ( rats ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected ex@@ position of therapeutic dosage in humans were observed , however , a number of less changes including th@@ ym@@ us@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and smaller sk@@ el@@ eton changes were observed , which indicates a del@@ ayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fication of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( Boo@@ adding ) , must be applied higher dos@@ es to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use in patients with weak or light liver function sub@@ merg@@ ed with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver function , it is imp@@ acted ( see section 4.3 ) .

A@@ gener@@ ase should be set up to 27 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allerg@@ ic symptoms , or the v@@ eil are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
a increased risk for li@@ p@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drugs - dependent factors such as a longer and@@ au@@ ern@@ de anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated to associated met@@ abolic dis@@ orders .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ ig@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C caused by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
508 % increases for C@@ max contrast by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in plasma , which have been achieved in combination with am@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended that this combination is not known , because the effec@@ tiveness and in@@ firm@@ ity of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fav@@ or@@ ence in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ av@@ ir is not recommended , because the ex@@ position of both proteins was serious .
when this product is used together , cau@@ tion is commanded ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be performed , since an exact forecast of the combination of am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is needed to increase the dosage of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data are available .

the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir to 22 % respectively .

in case of an over@@ dose , the patient was observed on the signs of an in@@ tox@@ ication ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary , necessary support measures .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in ak@@ ut and chronic infected cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ ute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic inf@@ ested cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,50 µg / ml ) .
in vice vers@@ a , Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir holds his activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing insulation ; the recei@@ pt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in Isol@@ ate .
based on these data , the therapy project should be considered to be considered to be expected to achieve the expected value of &quot; non @-@ test@@ oster@@ one &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .

A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication for treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefits of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir &quot; bo@@ ost@@ ed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for entry was not yet treated with PI @-@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients .
the Bi@@ over@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as a solution for entry is 14 % lower than of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir than capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for entry to a milli@@ grams of a milli@@ gram basis is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .

in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. an permission for the domestic transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combined form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combined DNA technology under the use of CH@@ O @-@ mamm@@ als cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s is for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with as@@ sured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to handle the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manif@@ est@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ ations should be done by a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other diseases of met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h if the patient can contri@@ butes this to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and effic@@ acy of al@@ dur@@ ations in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended .
safety and effic@@ acy of al@@ dur@@ ations in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency was not determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended .
patients can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions to develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any in connection , while inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also be monit@@ ored for these patients , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s should be made only in a reasonable clinical environment , where rest@@ ing equipment for medical emerg@@ encies are now available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase form , usually within 3 months from treatment .
patients , anti@@ bodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , must be treated when appl@@ ying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience concerning the treatment of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , must be careful due to theoretical increased risk reaction after inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of the inf@@ usion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tik@@ a ) to minim@@ ize the potential feed @-@ related reactions .
in case of light or medium inf@@ usion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be reduced and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on half of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped , until the symptoms have brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be desired .
the inf@@ usion can be entered with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate , which occurred in the reaction .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ ps and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate , which occurred in the previous reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Pro@@ ca@@ in , because a potential risk of inter@@ ference with intra@@ ocular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experiments run not on direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there were no data based on n@@ atives that were exported to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase across the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to pres@@ cri@@ bed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s .
the ad@@ verse events in clinical trials were random@@ ized mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with 5 years of treatment ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted medicines @-@ inter@@ actions in connection with al@@ dur@@ ations that were observed during the phase 3 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently used in the following table following the following frequency : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with serious M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ cond@@ itional participation of the upper re@@ spir@@ atory tract and l@@ ungs in the pre@@ historic times , another reactions were up , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , re@@ spir@@ atory bow@@ ls and fac@@ ial ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted fertil@@ is@@ ations in connection with al@@ dur@@ ations that were recorded during a ph@@ ant@@ 2 study with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5 years , with mostly severe conf@@ essed and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most cases , it came to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , most of the patients under@@ gone up to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version ( mean after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
by the end of the phase 3 study ( or until prec@@ eding out from the study ) were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) Ass@@ ay intern@@ ally detected anti@@ bodies , including three patients who never had to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version .
patients with def@@ aul@@ ted to a low @-@ old mirror showed a robust reduction of the G@@ ag @-@ Mir@@ acle in Har@@ n , while patients with high anti@@ bodies of anti @-@ anti@@ bodies had a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed mar@@ gin@@ ally to small neutr@@ alis@@ ing inhibit@@ or activity in vit@@ ro , which does not affect clinical effic@@ acy and / or decre@@ asing of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies of anti@@ bodies are not in connection with the incidence of imm@@ ense drug @-@ inter@@ actions , even if the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted pharmaceutical @-@ inter@@ actions are typically ed with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies .
the reasons for En@@ z@@ ymer@@ ic therapy is in one for the hydro@@ lys@@ is of accum@@ ulated subst@@ itute , and reducing an additional accum@@ ulation of enz@@ ym@@ es .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is taken from the circulation and of cells into the L@@ ys@@ os@@ omen , at the most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
safety and effic@@ acy of al@@ dur@@ ations were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study recru@@ ited the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phenom@@ ena and only one patient showed the severe phenom@@ enon .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ c@@ ated exports volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes to stand and 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for the effec@@ tiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and absolute sal@@ ute in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ ations treated patients compared to the placebo group , impro@@ ving the lung function and the capability that is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , impro@@ ving an improvement and / or rec@@ ession of this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s group and a group of 182 weeks in the placebo @-@ group , as follows the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not statist@@ ically significant and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased significantly propor@@ tional to body size .
from 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ alie treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study is a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease of the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inine ) was determined that remained constant at the end of the course .
regarding the h@@ eter@@ ogen@@ eous disease manif@@ estation between the patient , the clinical significant changes related to 5 patients ( 58 % ) , was generally consistent with 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase @-@ 2 study carried out in mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s were investigated by 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy version form and 4 with the middle @-@ running form ) .
in four patients , the dosage for increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) was found after the Z @-@ score for this age @-@ running form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle @-@ run form , probably limited to the older patients with severe contam@@ ination only limited or even any progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a Phase 4 study investig@@ ations , investig@@ ating pharmac@@ odynam@@ ic effects of various al@@ dur@@ um mir@@ acle in har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test were carried out .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ sch@@ ema with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be found in patients who are trouble with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not detected that the long @-@ term clinical effic@@ acy of these two dos@@ ing sch@@ em@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evalu@@ ate any new information that are available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the medication will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile for patients aged under 5 years was similar to el@@ derly and less affected patients .
based on the conventional studies of safety , tox@@ icity in unique gift , tox@@ icity in recur@@ sively gift , tox@@ icity in re@@ trac@@ ting gift and reproduction , these pre@@ clinical data will be recogni@@ z@@ able for the human clinical data .

the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every new information , which will be available annually , and if necessary , the packing fee will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , this is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , if the dil@@ ution under controlled and val@@ idi@@ zed as@@ ep@@ tic conditions were used .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s @-@ Inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technology ) • J@@ e to body weight of the individual patients first to determine the number of water bottles .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with Cis@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) if the cancer is not re@@ se@@ ated &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant alone ) and mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant alone can be easily removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) is probably slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ cell &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who were previously untreated in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously applied other chem@@ other@@ ap@@ ies when used as a few therapy .
to reduce any side effects , patients should receive a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered with Cis@@ plat@@ in , in addition , a &quot; Anti@@ em@@ et@@ ikum &quot; should be given an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ et@@ ikum &quot; ( drugs against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liqu@@ ids ( to avoid liquid man@@ gel ) .
in patients whose blood is changed or certain other side effects , the treatment should be raised , set or the dosage should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed demanded the formation of DNA and RNA and prev@@ ents the cells .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form is easier access to cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the medication and a longer effects in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease .
in treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 571 patients were treated with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el effects ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 725 patients who received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in were treated at an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months at the all@@ few appoint@@ ments of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , average survival was with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7,9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies however , patients who does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells , with the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta provides longer survival times than with the comparison of comparison .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. an permission for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each serving bottle must be dis@@ sol@@ ves with 4,2 ml 0,9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ cks is taken from the de@@ pl@@ ating bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ in indicated to first @-@ line therapy of patients with loc@@ ally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma except for sur@@ pris@@ ingly con@@ ep@@ ith@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic breast cancer except in @-@ law @-@ gender quot@@ ep@@ ith@@ eli@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( K@@ OF ) is administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² K@@ OF as an inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes from the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion in the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma according to pre @-@ adjusted chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF administ@@ ered intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
reduction of skin and sever@@ ity actions must be given on day before and on day of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ gift as well as the day after treatment an Kor@@ tik@@ ov@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 dos@@ es fo@@ lic acid , and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose , as well as after each third beam .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , should be created before each gift a complete blood image , including a differenti@@ ation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a t@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes census .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ an@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( ALT or SG@@ PT ) should be up to 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a Dos@@ age test will be taking place at the beginning of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood level or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the forec@@ asting therapy cycles .
following the recovery , the patient must be applied to the tables in tables 1 , 2 and 3 to apply for ALI@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
if patients were non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grade 3 ( excl . ne@@ ur@@ otox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrup@@ ted by ALI@@ TA , until the patient received the value before the treatment
treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dos@@ es induc@@ t@@ ance a ha@@ em@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity in grade 3 or 4 , or instant tox@@ icity at degrees 3 or 4 ne@@ ur@@ otox@@ icity .
clinical trials no note that in patients suffering from 65 years or higher compared to patients at age 65 , an elev@@ ated secondary risk assessment .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ compliance data to the un@@ think@@ able and effic@@ acy .
in clinical trials were not necessary in clinical trials with a cancer drug Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dose custom@@ iz@@ ations required for all patients recommended dos@@ es .
data analysis in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver ab@@ normal@@ ities of &gt; the 1,5 @-@ fold out of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ asis ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ asis ) were not especially studied in studies .
patients must be monit@@ ored with regard to bone @-@ mark@@ ers and may not be administ@@ ered to patients before whose absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ic value has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the t@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tes value again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ic numbers , t@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ths and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they observed in the previous treatment cycles , observed ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and reduction of degree 3 / 4 of ha@@ em@@ ic and ni@@ chth@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity such as Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , fe@@ br@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was be@@ aten when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treated patients must be examined , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ es@@ lac@@ tic treatment for reducing @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency ( cancer cells ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and decrease of therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients suffering from treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ age is intended to avoid taking of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ eri@@ or ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients who occurred in these events , corresponding risk factors for ren@@ aming of ren@@ al events , including Deh@@ ydr@@ at@@ ation , of the hyper@@ tension , or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid collection in the trans@@ form of trans@@ form , a drainage of the result before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be done .
5 severe cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ ine attack , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ous events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this substance was usually given in combination with another cy@@ t@@ otox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated vit@@ di@@ ments ( except y@@ el@@ y@@ f@@ ie@@ ves , this imp@@ lication is not recommended ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible break@@ down of re@@ productive capacity should be noted , men should be pointed out before treatment - G@@ inn should be noted , advice regarding the sper@@ m preserv@@ ation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high dos@@ es of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ic@@ ic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g / day ) .
therefore , cau@@ tion is commanded , if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high dos@@ es of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- ty@@ l@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid can be applied in high dosage .

since there is no data regarding the interaction potential , like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application must be reduced for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re- .
the large INTRA @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ ag@@ ul@@ ative and ant@@ astic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zed ratio ) , when the decision was hit to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co .
there are no data for use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in sw@@ ang@@ ers , but how to an@@ de@@ - Anti@@ met@@ abol@@ ites are expected to become severe birth def@@ ects in pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necess@@ ity is challeng@@ ing and after a careful subst@@ itute for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shafts made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment start , advice regarding the sper@@ m preserv@@ ation .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in the breast milk over@@ comes and un@@ wanted effects at the st@@ ill@@ ary inf@@ ants cannot be excluded .

Alo@@ xi is used by chem@@ other@@ ap@@ ies , which are strong de@@ sol@@ u@@ ble for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like Cis@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as with Chem@@ other@@ ap@@ ies , the tri@@ gger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effic@@ acy of Alo@@ xi may be increased by an additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as Anti@@ em@@ et@@ ikum ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended , because the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the substance f@@ ills of an chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the int@@ est@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults , the chem@@ other@@ ap@@ ies received severe or moderate effect for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , the strong performance sol@@ u@@ ble for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of those patients treated with Alo@@ xi , treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy alone ( 132 of 223 ) , treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
by Chem@@ other@@ ap@@ ies , the moderate de@@ emer of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients who treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy alone ( 153 of 185 ) , treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the total of the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed as prevention of ac@@ ute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ etics and prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moderate em@@ eto@@ ing chemotherapy due to cancer cancer .
the effic@@ acy of Alo@@ xi on prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is induc@@ ed by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron may extend the thick@@ est passage , patients should be monit@@ ored with an am@@ nest@@ y or@@ ip@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ ac@@ ute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
like with other 5@@ H@@ T3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , the cau@@ tion of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medication used to extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients , with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or to achieve an extension .
except in connection with another chem@@ other@@ ap@@ eu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi in days after chemotherapy was not used to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical trials , the resistance of the five analys@@ ed chem@@ other@@ ap@@ eu@@ tics cannot ( Cis@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D6 inhibit@@ ors .

experiences about the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ anci@@ es are not applied , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is required by the doctor &apos;s doctor as necessary .
in clinical trials , the most common ad@@ verse events were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 633 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in the context , he@@ ada@@ che ( 9 % ) and or@@ char@@ ity ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions on the appoint@@ ments ( burning , har@@ dening , compl@@ aints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar numbers of un@@ wanted events were similar to the other dos@@ ages ; there were no dose @-@ effective relation@@ ships .
there were no di@@ alys@@ is studies , however , due to the large distribution volume , however , is probably not effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind study showed a total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 Cis@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 intra@@ ven@@ ous ( half @-@ time 7,3 hours ) received intra@@ ven@@ ously per day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .

results of the studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ ing chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ otype are sum@@ mar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indic@@ ating chemotherapy induc@@ ed nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( CIN@@ V ) were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of the clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block at the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and rep@@ orter of I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ als and extend the duration of the shareholders .
aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers performed the assessment of EC@@ G effects from i.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single d@@ ots of 0.25 , 0,75 and 2.25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption To intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of plasma concentration in an initial elim@@ ination of the body with an average termin@@ ale of about 40 hours .
the average plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tionally dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg .
according to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 dos@@ es , there were 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic sim@@ ulations , that , at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached overall ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) that was comparable to 0.75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max after the one @-@ off value of 0.75 mg was higher .
about 40 % are elim@@ inated by kid@@ neys and elim@@ inated about another 50 % in two primary met@@ abol@@ ites , which have in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on 5@@ H@@ T3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies to met@@ abol@@ ism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D6 and , in lower measurements , the I@@ so@@ ym@@ enz@@ ym@@ CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved .
elim@@ ination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the ur@@ ine re@@ located , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified active ingre@@ dient ; approx . 40 % of the given dosage .
following a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ projection at Ges@@ unden was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing at 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver ab@@ normal@@ ities , the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination up@@ ward and the average system@@ ic ex@@ position with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases reducing the dose which is not just@@ ified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which will be considered sufficient for clinical use of therapeutic exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 of pre@@ clinical trials took not@@ ices that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can be block@@ ed in very high concentrations of I@@ onic channels , which can take part in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ os@@ ization .
high dos@@ es of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose said in about the 30s of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily for two years , led to a combined frequency of liver tum@@ ors , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , out@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ours with rats , but not for mice .
the under@@ lying mechan@@ isms are not completely known , but due to the used dos@@ es and da Alo@@ xi in human application , the relev@@ ance of these results as low as human being weigh@@ ted .

in June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ it@@ ators ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C was recommended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C by the Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that the Alp@@ he@@ on is a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same ar@@ z@@ ne@@ y@@ ich , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference ar@@ z@@ bow &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long persist@@ ed ) hep@@ atitis C ( one of an virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic analysis the liver det@@ eri@@ ous damage is in addition , the values of liver cells Al@@ an@@ in@@ - amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( ALT ) are increased by the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene was put into a gene ( DNA ) , which is aimed at the formation of the active material .
the manufacturer of al@@ he@@ on laid data before reaching the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and pur@@ ity of medication , effects , safety and effic@@ acy at hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effic@@ acy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the effec@@ tiveness of reference to 455 patients .
in the study , the study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment courses and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no sign of the virus ) .

the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C based on the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to clinical study .
after setting the treatment with al@@ pine flame ret@@ ained the disease in more patients than with the reference ar@@ z@@ bow ; moreover the Alp@@ he@@ on had more ad@@ verse events .
apart from the study , the drug pro@@ hib@@ ited a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibody - special proteins - against pharmac@@ euticals ) , not sufficient to evalu@@ ate the medicine .

it works by blocking the bacter@@ ial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the effec@@ tiveness of the effic@@ acy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was bott@@ led after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients conducted by Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of inf@@ eri@@ ous Hau@@ tw@@ ald showed al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ alex@@ in similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together , they said about 90 % of patients contributed to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go has been identified during the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ essen ( time filled with cement fabric ) or inf@@ ections that caused by M@@ RS@@ A , not effective enough .
the most common secondary effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) is a fri@@ ction at the order point .
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ators ( CH@@ MP ) has reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go to the short @-@ surface treatment of the following common skin infection , compared to the risks : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , ben@@ ds or stit@@ ched w@@ ounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the European Union .
patients who have no improvement occurred within two to three days , should still be investigated again and a altern@@ atives in subject ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ ateral or heavy @-@ local dec@@ im@@ ation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ bul@@ in Sal@@ be , the treatment should be carefully analys@@ ed and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is to be used to treat inf@@ ections , where M@@ RS@@ A is known as a re@@ spiration or probably ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary w@@ ounds , the effic@@ acy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ anian in patients with inf@@ ections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RS@@ A ) were un@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is considered to be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or det@@ eri@@ oration of inf@@ ecti@@ ous place .
the effect of the simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to its low plasma concentrations , that reaches human skin or infected high @-@ quality w@@ ounds in vi@@ vo , the clinical ob@@ vious in@@ hibition is not expected in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After @-@ time or@@ derly treatment of 2 times a day , 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the average Sav@@ i@@ am@@ ash of AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased to a healthy skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic ex@@ position of top@@ ical application in patients are not required , if the top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ ri@@ um is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have demonstrated a reproduction to oral , and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the f@@ ö@@ t@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacter@@ ial therapy is clear and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ash of the gift of a system@@ ic anti@@ biot@@ ics .
in the decision whether the st@@ oves continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go will continue / ended , is between the benefits of the nurs@@ ing and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials to 2150 patients with super@@ ficial skin inf@@ ections , the Al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most common reported in@@ spir@@ atory effect was reported by the appointment of approximately 1 % of the patients .
active Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( former Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of the bacter@@ ial protein synth@@ esis by interaction at a specific binding station of the 50@@ S sub@@ scale of the bacter@@ ial ri@@ bos@@ oms which diff@@ ers from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting substances .
data indicates that the eng@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ eng@@ agement and the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring centre .
through binding on this bin@@ oc@@ ul@@ ums P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine des pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ eng@@ agement of inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
should be on the reason of the local prev@@ alen@@ ce of resistance the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some inf@@ ections show , should be ad@@ vised by experts .
there were no differences in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ bul@@ in versus S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EUS , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were .
in case of a non @-@ speaking treatment in S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EUS , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ one @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ cid@@ in ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was put 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ bul@@ in Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ cl@@ usion to in@@ tac@@ te and put on we@@ ap@@ ron skin for up to 7 days .
out of 516 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ bul@@ in Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of sec@@ und@@ ane infected w@@ ounds , individual plasma welding were won .
the sample ceremony took place on the days 3 or 4 in adult patients , before the median of media and with the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording at the people of top@@ ical use of 1 % Sal@@ be on 200 cm2 be@@ ating skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ bul@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases associated with the liver aff@@ ecting the liver between a and 15 years ) that are not imm@@ unity for these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two dos@@ es of existing vacc@@ ination , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason why Ambi@@ rix may be used , if the immun@@ isation is a lower risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is ensu@@ red that the vacc@@ ines can be led to the end of two dos@@ es .
if a collection of hep@@ atitis A or B is required , Ambi@@ rix , or other hep@@ atitis A@@ - or B vacc@@ ine can be given .
vacc@@ ines require by using the immune system ( the natural def@@ ende of the body ) , &quot; as it can be against a disease .
after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system recognize the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as a &quot; foreign &quot; and creates anti@@ bodies in contrast .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix Adults and the vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same disease , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given an existing vacc@@ ination program .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Adults identical ingredients contain some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a cover for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indic@@ ator for the effic@@ acy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed one month after the last injection of anti @-@ protective anti @-@ con@@ feder@@ ations .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effic@@ acy of vacc@@ ine is compared to a six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for developing anti@@ bodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of ambient temperature of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine dos@@ es ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , appet@@ izer , pain in the injection point , carrying , activity ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may cause severe sensitive to active ( allerg@@ ic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
August 2002 shared the European Commission to the Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a approval for the domestic transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standard ti@@ met@@ able plan for the prim@@ ers with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose on the date and the second dose is administ@@ ered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collection of hep@@ atitis A is required for hep@@ atitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ ine vacc@@ ines or using a combination sim@@ ulations .
the Anti @-@ Hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ Ag ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ Ag ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ bodies are in the same size such as after vacc@@ ine with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ine vacc@@ ines .
it is still not secured whether immune compet@@ ent people who require a hep@@ atitis A@@ - vacc@@ ines as well as protection , because they are not protected by the immune mem@@ orial by the immune memory .
3 How to all injection sim@@ ulations should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vacc@@ ine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hep@@ atitis B is necessary , the Stand@@ ar@@ dim@@ pf@@ sch@@ ema is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combined hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gen .
for hem@@ odi@@ alys@@ is patient and persons with dis@@ orders of the immune system , there is no stri@@ ped out of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ anti@@ bodies , so that in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ine is necessary .
since a non @-@ thin injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration , could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ rec@@ y , these inj@@ ectors should be avo@@ ided .
however , at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ia or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation can be inj@@ ected , however , it can be inj@@ ected as possible in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular organisms type b @-@ vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ aster vacc@@ ine was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ o@@ res@@ si@@ ver therapy , or in patients with immun@@ def@@ ects , no sufficient immune response has to be achieved .
in a clinical study , which was carried out with 3 vacc@@ ine of these form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , ro@@ enter@@ itis , he@@ ada@@ che and fever , comparable to the incidence that was observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ ate and preserv@@ ative @-@ based vacc@@ ine form@@ ulation was observed .
in clinical trials , 2029 were administ@@ ered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix with the 3 @-@ cans combinations was compared .
only excep@@ tions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ters at a daily basis for vacc@@ ination , but not based on a calculations .
pain has been observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 50,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 39,@@ 1 % in the subjects after the gift of a 3 @-@ dos@@ es @-@ combinations .
according to the complete vacc@@ ine cycle , 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects who had been administ@@ ered by pain , over 6@@ 3.8 % for subjects who were vacc@@ inated with a 3 @-@ dose combinations .
however , the frequency of mat@@ eness was comparable high ( i.e. the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 39,@@ 6 % of subjects , the Ambi@@ rix , compared with 36,@@ 2 % for subjects who received 3 @-@ dos@@ es @-@ combinations possible ) .
the prev@@ alen@@ ce of pr@@ ono@@ unced pain and mat@@ ters was low and comparable to administration of combination with the 3 @-@ t@@ ine vacc@@ ine was observed .

in clinical trials that were conducted at vacc@@ ination at the age of 1 and including 15 years , the Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sions@@ rates were carried out after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 ab@@ bre@@ ed dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sions@@ rates for Anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose , and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 ab@@ bre@@ ed dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .

in the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y rates were significant ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose which was significantly higher than Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , in a clinical comparison study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the termination of the full vacc@@ ination ( i.e. , in month 7 ) were achieved , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ t@@ ine vacc@@ ines with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ t@@ ine vacc@@ ines with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combined hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gen .
for people who were at the time of prim@@ ers between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ines .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg of combined hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .

you can feel very ti@@ red , have a dark ur@@ ine , a b@@ ital face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow sear@@ ches ) and other symptoms that may be needed a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix does not protect any infection with hep@@ atitis C or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ine series has been completed with 2 dos@@ es .
if you are infected with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , if you are infected with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus ( though you can &apos;t feel un@@ likely or ill . feel un@@ likely to feel un@@ likely or sick ) .
a protection against other inf@@ ections that cause liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those of hep@@ atitis C or Hepatitis B infection cannot be used .
• If you have an allerg@@ ic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any component of this vacc@@ ine is shown including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allerg@@ ic reaction can cause an allerg@@ ic skin irrit@@ ation , re@@ spir@@ atory or bru@@ ising of fac@@ ial or tongue . • If you have occurred an allerg@@ ic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you have a serious infection with fever .
if you want to have an protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual administration on the second vacc@@ ination ) .
in a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor may ab@@ sent you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis A@@ - / hep@@ atitis B vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of an re@@ combined Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vacc@@ ine is treated with the reduced content to the first dose , and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ine before loading of the V@@ acc@@ ine series .
at least Ambi@@ rix of people suffer from heavy blood dis@@ orders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s physical bri@@ gade / or if you are under@@ taken / or your child moves to a hem@@ odi@@ alys@@ is .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people can &apos;t be sufficient to see that a blood test is necessary to see how strongly recommend the reaction to the vacc@@ ination .
21 If you take your doctor , if you have taken another drug / income ( including those who have without dis@@ cre@@ tion ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or imm@@ or@@ lo@@ bul@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) , or if you have been given or this in close future is planned .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient , and the person is not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
if another vacc@@ ine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as different li@@ mb@@ s .
if Ambi@@ rix said to the same time or shortly before or after injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ l@@ ines , it is probably that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine is still sufficient .
normally Ambi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women not administ@@ ered , except it is urg@@ ent necessary that they are vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have an allerg@@ ic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , you speak with your doctor and make a new appointment as soon as possible .

in patients who suffer from an early manif@@ est at Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an argument of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ APS tablets may not be administ@@ ered to patients with dis@@ orders , since there is a risk for the emer@@ gence of eco @-@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets cannot come into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ APS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MON@@ APS should be in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency , as well as with sodium carbonate and anti @-@ formation clinical trials are used only with cau@@ tion .
since met@@ abol@@ ism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is performed on the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ APS should be used with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ denser ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ k@@ ut@@ an heritage of Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate to young rats ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ur@@ onal pro@@ lifer@@ ation and increased loss of ne@@ ur@@ ons .
it also found a del@@ ayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ ebr@@ al syn@@ ap@@ sen and a reduced number of function@@ ing nerv@@ es in the brain and thereby a dis@@ ability of brain growth .
it could not be found if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is di@@ vor@@ ced in the mother &apos;s milk , and out of this reason , the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS during the nurs@@ ing time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ APS &apos; occurred in 56 % of patients at least one un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ wanted events that they were not treated with AM@@ MON@@ APS in connection .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a higher tox@@ ic@@ ic reaction to the AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ e@@ ech@@ ari@@ ous , periph@@ eral hyp@@ op@@ to@@ pen@@ ia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ pan@@ ic .
a case of an over@@ dose came to an average dose of 10 g ( 1370 mg / kg ) with a significant single dose of 10 g ( 1370 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go to the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which at an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of dos@@ es up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limitation of ne@@ ur@@ otox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate is a met@@ abol@@ ically active connection , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine to Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is di@@ vor@@ ced by the kid@@ neys .
br@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric@@ ally seen Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with Urea comparable ( both connections include 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to differenti@@ ation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ orders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram protein but@@ y@@ rate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen are produced .
it is importance that the diagnosis was an early stage and treatment is immediately begun to improve survival and clinical result .
the pro@@ gn@@ osis of the ear@@ liest form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ b@@ orns was nearly always inf@@ ist , and the disease led itself with treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ alys@@ is and essential amino acids or with their stick@@ y @-@ free Analog@@ a within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ alys@@ is , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ate k@@ ost and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids was possible to increase survival in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) to increase orders to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients the survival rate was diagnosed with many intel@@ lec@@ tual dis@@ abilities or other neurolog@@ ic defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manif@@ est form of the disease ( including female patient with h@@ eter@@ o@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ ce , and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ reduction diet was treated , the survival rate is 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients , a further det@@ eri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ic inj@@ ections occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate to Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney @-@ glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and his met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were evaluated according to a single dose of 5 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in n@@ ud@@ ly healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis for single use as well as repeated gases of oral dos@@ es of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and his met@@ abol@@ ites was also analys@@ ed with intra@@ ven@@ ous gift from sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a single dose of 5 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of Phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lic@@ ences or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opat@@ hi@@ es , after different dos@@ es , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) there is no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day ) were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three individuals ) , the mean Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate concentration in the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
the drug is used within 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine across the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cleus tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tox@@ icity and non @-@ toxic dos@@ es ( investig@@ ations 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MON@@ APS gran@@ ules may be taken either by oral ( inf@@ ants and children who can &apos;t kill tablets , or patients with sl@@ ot@@ ape ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde given .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ b@@ orns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of over 20 kg as well as her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( particularly bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal area .
in patients who suffer from an early manif@@ est at Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ APS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram So@@ dium phen@@ ylene rate , equal to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
if you were sub@@ jected to the birth of Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit by Phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate ) , there came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of brain cells .
a higher tox@@ ic@@ ic reaction to the AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ e@@ ech@@ ari@@ ous , periph@@ eral hyp@@ op@@ to@@ pen@@ ia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ pan@@ ic .

on the basis of investig@@ ations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ orders of the ur@@ inary cycle , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further det@@ eri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ic inj@@ ections occur .
after a single dose of 5 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of Phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the last product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
for this approach , the small measuring spoon 0,95 g , the average measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring sco@@ ops 8.6 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient received the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MON@@ APS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es , so that they can dep@@ end the stick@@ y of waste products which is not elim@@ inated after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you need to cons@@ ult the physician , that you can affect AM@@ MON@@ APS , since So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MON@@ APS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ euticals if you have taken other medicines or recently , if it is not pres@@ cription drugs .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; ac@@ ute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ synchron@@ ous &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( heart attack ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ ree ( heart failure ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value of electro@@ cardi@@ ac or E@@ KG ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to det@@ ect blood cl@@ ots in patients who used a PCI , a higher dose , and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contri@@ bute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack on blood flow to the heart and increase the effic@@ acy of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS part in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox for all@@ some gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for the prevention of blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with hep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ anti@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
while the PCI was often a stim@@ ulus ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent one closure , and they received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ auses , such as br@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS @-@ An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from G@@ PI - the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attack , or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ went a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except at heavy ble@@ eding , with which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used to be used in patients who are possibly more sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other brain or one of the other components .
it may not be applied in patients who had a blood dis@@ infection , as well as people with a strong hyper@@ tension , or severe cardi@@ oid problems or heart attack .
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ators ( CH@@ MP ) has reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox &apos;s treatment in the treatment of ACS and a PCI is an in@@ comparable subst@@ itute for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the corpor@@ ation Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the transport of an@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ synchron@@ ous ( inst@@ ated Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) for an emergency aid or if an early intervention is fore@@ seen .
the recommended initi@@ als of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ability of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by a inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
if in the patient in another epis@@ ode one PCI is carried out , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the inf@@ usion for the duration of surgery on 1.75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , Inf@@ us@@ ion@@ sd@@ osis was reduced from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a Bol@@ us@@ ation of 0.5 mg / kg , followed by a inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consisting of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one is immediately followed by intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and effic@@ acy of an all@@ few Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) should be reduced to below 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ al of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be done .
in order to reduce the exp@@ ense of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted drugs in front of the application should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ al dose may be administ@@ ered intra@@ ven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided , the 1.75 mg / kg Inf@@ us@@ ion@@ sd@@ osis is given correctly .
in patients with middle severe cardi@@ oid restri@@ ction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which should be sub@@ jected to a PCI board ( either with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in versus ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is achieved and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ eum .
in patients with moderate kidney compensation , which led to the approval of II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the treatment of the B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose custom@@ ization at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney compensation ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ alys@@ is charges ( see Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be di@@ ver@@ ted for 30 minutes after the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated hep@@ arin or 8 hours after termination of the sub@@ mer@@ sible gift of low @-@ molecular Hep@@ arin .
• Non @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingre@@ dient , or other components or against brain activity . • severe ac@@ cred@@ itation hyper@@ tension and sub@@ ac@@ ute bacter@@ ial end@@ oc@@ ard@@ itis . • severe kidney compensation ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ alys@@ is charges .
patients are carefully inspec@@ ted with symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding , especially if B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in combination with another anti @-@ anti@@ ag@@ ulation is administ@@ ered ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI @-@ patients under@@ went underground stations in most cases of ar@@ ter@@ ial punc@@ ture methods , patients who occur at a per@@ k@@ ut@@ ants Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment is prin@@ cip@@ ally everywhere .
in patients who use War@@ far@@ in and treated with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should be considered to ensure a monitoring of IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) to ensure that the value returned to treatment with the treatment with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in .
starting from the knowledge about the active mechanism of anti @-@ anti@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tik@@ a or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that the active ingredients will increase .
at the combination of B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with t@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ te fi@@ brill@@ ation or anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ as@@ ep@@ ar@@ ters are regularly to control regularly .

severe ble@@ eding were defined after the AC@@ UI@@ TY and Tim@@ i measure for severe ble@@ eding as defined in Table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ eding were significantly less frequently than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and B@@ ival@@ id@@ ru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
a AC@@ UI@@ TY severe ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , hem@@ at@@ oma with diameter ≥ 5 g / dl without ob@@ vious blood circulation , imp@@ air@@ ing of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ spiegel &apos;s of ≥ 3 g / dl , with known blood of blood , re@@ operation due to a ble@@ eding , application of blood products for trans@@ f@@ usion .

the following data on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who under@@ went a PCI .
both in the B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in the hep@@ arin @-@ treated groups came to women as well as in patients more than 65 years of age to un@@ wanted events as with male or younger patients .

An@@ gi@@ ox contains B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , one direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ inhibit@@ or , which is located at the cat@@ aly@@ tic center as well as at the an@@ ion@@ ist region of TH@@ RO@@ MB@@ IN , regardless of whether TH@@ RO@@ MB@@ IN is bound in the liquid phase or an t@@ inn@@ acle .
the Bind@@ ings of B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in TH@@ RO@@ MB@@ IN , and thus its effects , is rever@@ si@@ bly , because TH@@ RO@@ MB@@ IN was taking off the eng@@ agement of B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly which allows the function of the active centre of TH@@ RO@@ MB@@ IN .
furthermore , by B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with ser@@ um of patients who had come to hep@@ ac@@ in@@ induc@@ ed Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ia / hep@@ ac@@ in@@ induc@@ ed Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( HIT / HI@@ TTS ) , no Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten aggreg@@ ate reaction are induc@@ ed .

Ap@@ i@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adol@@ esc@@ ents and children from six years with diabetes , who require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ i@@ dra is administ@@ ered sub@@ lime ( under the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall , ens@@ uring a th@@ igh@@ s or upper inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease , in which the body does not suff@@ ice enough ins@@ ulin to control the glucose level ( sugar ) in blood or ins@@ ulin can not be effective .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ in diff@@ ers very smaller by human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter effects than a short @-@ effective human being .
Ap@@ i@@ dra was examined in combination with a durable ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce in@@ ins@@ ulin , in two trials with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin was not effective , Ap@@ i@@ dra was investigated in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ lier@@ tes hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7,60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lo@@ wering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0,@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ i@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in human @-@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ i@@ dra must not be used in patients who are possibly more sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against ins@@ ulin @-@ ul@@ inum or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the dos@@ es of Ap@@ i@@ dra must be adjusted , if it is used together with a number of other medicines , which can work on the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ venti@@ s Germany GmbH a approval for the transport of Ap@@ i@@ dra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ i@@ dra is available as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the range of ab@@ dom@@ inal v@@ int@@ ment , to apply mut@@ ual inf@@ usion in the range of ab@@ dom@@ inal coating in the range of ab@@ dom@@ inal cord .
due to the reduced Glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced ins@@ ulin delivery can be set up in patients with an limitation of liver function .
any changing of the effects , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the In@@ sul@@ in@@ ty@@ ps ( normally , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ hes@@ it@@ ates etc ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can with@@ draw a change of ins@@ ulin .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or break@@ down in a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ abet@@ ic c@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ osis ; these states are potenti@@ ally life .
withdraw@@ al of a patient on one other in@@ ins@@ ulin type or in@@ sul@@ in one another manufacturer should be taken under strict medical supervision and can be needed to change the dosage .
at the time of a tre@@ ating of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin and can change the treatment of treatment sch@@ em@@ as .
increasing the substances that increases the blood sugar level and increase the incl@@ ination to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , angi@@ ography , Fi@@ br@@ ates , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ in , mon@@ o@@ amine @-@ oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ en , sal@@ icy@@ lic acid and sul@@ fon@@ amide anti@@ biot@@ ics .
