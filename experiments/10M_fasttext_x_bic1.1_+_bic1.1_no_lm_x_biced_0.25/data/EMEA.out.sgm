<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Research Report (EPAR), which is explained, as the committee for Humanarzler (CHMP), which is carried out in the study to obtain recommendations regarding the application of medication.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your disease or their treatment, please read the package supplied (also part of the EPAR) or contact you to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information regarding the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is less than 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth) as solution to take (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres Think and Speech, Hallucinations (listening or seeing of dingen, which are not present), missives and wound orders; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychological disease, with the periods of manoic episodes (periods of abnormal High approval).</seg>
<seg id="6">Aborate is applied to the treatment of moderate to severe episodes and to prevention of manicism in patients who are addressed in the past, used in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of stopping unrest or behavioral interference, if the oral intake of medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases the solution can be applied for insertion or melting range of patients in patients who prepares the fragments of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients receiving other medicines at the same time, the dose should be derived from Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impaired the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances, communicating the communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol works mainly as "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Aripiprazol such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less extent than the neurotransmitter to enable the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine by Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to normalize the activity of brain or normalize, resulting from psychotic or maneuotic symptoms and their resting is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, preventing the symptoms of symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared with 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from two hours to placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was more than twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of aborate and placebo to prevent resting up to 160 patients, with which the manian symptoms had been stabilized with waste oil.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of aborate injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from Lorazepam (another anti-psychotonic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or number of patients who were examined on treatment, examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also resulted in studies to examine how the body the melting tabletten and the solution for insertion (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with injection solution, patients who received doses in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received significantly more stronger reduction of symptoms and patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In four of the five short-term studies in four of the five short-term studies of interpolishing symptoms were more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Aborate predominate more than 74 weeks of more effective than placebo during previously treated patients and when it was administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Cut-out injection ections in 10 or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms and were alike like Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of aborate (observed at 1-10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale interdisorders (constant flow), spinal hypertention (increased saving production), spinal hypertention (increased saving production), fatigue and excretion, rupeacity, Insomnie (sleep disruptions) and Angular states.</seg>
<seg id="25">The committee for Humanitators (CHMP) has reached the conclusion that the advantages of aborating schizophrenia and of medium-severe episodes at the treatment of Schizophrenia and with the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, the mainly manoic episodes and with those episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol said, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee also came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in the fast control of injection practices and behavioral interference in patients with chlorizophrenia, or patients with manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the intercourse of aborating aborate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for treatment of regular up to severe episodes of the Bipolar I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manian episode to patients who had the greater part of manages and their manoic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day during an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">The effectiveness of dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With respect to the bigger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial frequency dose should be considered to be considered for clinical factors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction consists of combination therapy, the Aripiprazor dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide behaviour is to mental disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after alternating an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased suicide risk of suicide in comparison to other non-psychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aricrazol should be applied to patients with known cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease, conditions, cardiovascular disease, conditions that are used for hypotonia, treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs) or hypertension (including actic and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: clinical trials that had a year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If using a ABILIFY treated patients and symptoms of a late dyskinesia, should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs and symptoms developed to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotica, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">As a result, Aripiprazol was supposed to be applied to patients with cramp in the anamnese or case that are applied with cramp in connection to be applied with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had treated patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted duvascular events were treated with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoazidose or hyperosmolarem or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic effects, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no exact risk provisions for hyperglycemia-related events in patients with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic effects of patients receiving direct calls.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, Polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) is observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus is regularly monitored regularly in terms of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight increase is generally expressed in schizophrined patients and in patients with bipolar Mania due to comorbidding, the use of antipsychotica, where weight increases as a secondary effect, and could lead to severe contamination and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is commanded, if Aripiprazol is supported in combination with alcohol or other central drug effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist of Famotidin, an gastric acid blocker, reduces the reorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not relevant than clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinese) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetin and paroxetin, similar effects and therefore should be done similar doses.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolism, the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol results in comparison to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you have shared the common gift of Ketoconazol or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors using ABILIFY, the potential benefit of potentially benefits for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, should be similar effects, and therefore they should be done similar doses.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be raised before the start of the companion.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY, can be administered with a regular increase in the Aricrazol- concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aricrazol per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3 methoxymorphan), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patient should be avoided to notify your doctor if she conceived, or a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the unsatisfying data protection for security at humans and due to the reproductive studies at the animal, this medication may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the possible benefits is justified the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotics, patients should be used to use hazardous machines, including power vehicles, to use, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the downside effects is defined after the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks entered with Aripiprazol, a total lower incidence (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, acathing and dyskinesie compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% were obtained under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14,8% were treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes on Bipolar-I disorder - in a controlled trial of 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS rose to 26,6% in patients, under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks at a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo was treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters, showed no medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Elevations of the CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptominations were observed in 3.5% of patients with Aripiprazol treated patients, compared to 2.0% of placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the adverse events that can occur in connection with an antipsychological therapy, the malignant neuroleptotic syndrome, spatidyskinesian events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or reversal acute overdose with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Though there is no information about the efficacy of an hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is inprobable that hereditary analysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits, since Aripiprazol has a high plasmaple binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the efficacy of Aripiprazol at Schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonist effect is used.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the dopamine d2- and D3-receptor and an excellent affinity to the dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1 adrento and to the Histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With the gift of Aripiprazol in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg. a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dossically dependent reduction of engagement from 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor-Liganden, on Nucleus caudatus and the turamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1.228 schizophrens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 of the proportion of Responsibilities, who contributed to the study medication, both similar to the study medication (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring skalen, defined as secondary students, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asbergine, Depressive transfer rates, showed significant improvement as in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic Schizophrenia was significantly higher reduction in response rate, representing 34% in Aripiprazol Group and 57% at placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olonapin-controlled, multinational dual-blind study at Schizophrenia was over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included in significantly fewer patients with significantly fewer patients with significantly fewer patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of about 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible dose over 3 weeks with a manor or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder showed Aricrazol to placebo over a placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study more than 3 weeks with fixed dosage in patients with a manor or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder showed Aricrazol to placebo any superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeents and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manor or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a comparatively superior effectiveness in week 3 and a reduction effects, which was comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also proved to a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of Mania such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with a manor or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, the concepting therapy with Aripiprazol has revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks, followed by a long-term extension hare over 74 weeks for manages, the Aripiprazol has achieved a remission in terms of placebo in terms of placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar backlash, mainly in the prevention of a bipolar regimen.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for dehydration and hydroxyelastics, the N-Dealkylation is catalyated by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshal life is nearly 75 hours for Aripiprazol in extensive metabolism over CYP2D6 and almost 146 hours in 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there is no differences in Pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as demonstrated in an pharmacokinic investigation, no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics revealed no indication on clinically significant differences with respect to ethylene belonging to pharmacokinetics from Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinical properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar to patients with serious cardiac disease in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on pharmacokinic and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to move on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies for safety, toxicity, toxicity in retractive gift, reproductive icicity, genotoxicity and the clereroid potential to recognize the preclinical data for the human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with doses or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposition in human beings, so they have limited to clinical use only or any significance.</seg>

<seg id="370">All of the study participating patients was at least eight weeks, Eprex / Erypo was injected before they were converted either on Abseamed or continue to Eprex / erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in hemoglobines between the beginning of the study and the general period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also laid out the results of a study, in which the effects of influential Abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were investigated by 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who were caused by a cardioid problems, the haemoglobinds of patients were converted to Abseamed as in case of those patients who continue to continue Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="375">The most common side effects of Abseamed is an increase of blood pressure, the occasionally to symptoms of an encephalopathy (epnprobleme) like sudden, steep and migrant headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed can not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against epetin alfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injection under the skin is not recommended for treatment of cardioid problems, since further studies are necessary to ensure that there is no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The committee for Humanitators (CHMP) came to the end that, in accordance with the regulations of the European Union to demonstrate that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and effects profile like Eprex / erypo.</seg>

<seg id="595">The incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta, can be reduced by gift of Paracetamol or Ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with cardiac interference (see section 4.4) At patients with cancer drug Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended, since limited clinical experiences for these patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) can not be necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients are similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use with children and adolescents under 18 years, since data are missing and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe inflammation efficiency (Kreatinine-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since these patient population is only limited clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="600">An existing hypocalzemia is at the beginning of the therapy with Aclasta sufficient to treat calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="610">Cardiac interference interferment Zoledronic acid was associated with cardiac function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinins) and in rare cases as an acute kidney cancer.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change from Kreatinine-Clearance (measured annually prior to administration) and the appearance of kidney function were comparable to osteoporosis and placebo over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatinins within 10 days after gift was observed in 1,8% of patients with Aclasta treated patients compared to 0.8% of patients treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values that were below 2.3% of patients with Aclasta in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21% of patients with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical freight charges and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoiding clinical fractures, the vitamin D mirrors were not obsolely as routinely, but the majority of patients received a initial frequency of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions to the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the infusion of the infusion, such as caster, swelling or / or pain, reported (0,7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekrosen in the jaw region, especially at cancer patients (Mostatics) reported that with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>

<seg id="627">The bone histology amounted to 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients who were treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies were taken.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomographic - (µCT) analysis showed an increase of trabecular bone-volume and renew the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptid of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-telopeptid (b-CTx) were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1.246 patients in periodic intervals.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5-mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP in excess of 30% compared to the initial value and was held at 28% below the initial value until 36 months.</seg>

<seg id="635">Effect on the bone mineral density (BMD) in the HORIZON-RFT study increased the Aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BMD to the total and makeup points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led over 24 months in comparison to the placebo treatment to an increase in the BMD by 5.4% to the total amount and 4.3% at the Schenkelhals.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy at Men In the HORIZON-RFT study were randomized to evaluate the BMD after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical cargo cultures in men; the frequency of clinical cargo cultures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), once an annual administration of Aclasta was related to the percentage change from Alendronat relative to the percentage change in comparison of the Loss vertebrae BMD after 24 months in comparison to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment in Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was investigated in patients with radiologically confirmed, especially light to moderate Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6fold to 3,0fold alterations in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of Riservronat once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months.</seg>
<seg id="642">Results in the combined results after 6 months, a similar decrease of pain and pain is observed compared to the output value for Aclasta and Riservronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified in the end of the six months study (previously specified (on the therapy), were able to be recorded in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 by Aclasta and 107 with Risedronat treated patients who received the therapeutic agent in 141 of patients with ircumronate, compared with 71 of patients with Risedronat treated patients, and follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiples of 5 and 15 minutes continuous infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, plasma welding rose to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rasches biphonic disappearance from the big cycle time t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with an terminale elimination time t ½ -146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early release stages (α and β, with the above mentioned ½ -values), presumably the fast resorption in the bones and the excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose in the urine, while the rest is primarily bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total clearing Clearance is independent of 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, breed or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of Zoledronsacid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearing from cytochrome-P450-enzyme systems metabolised substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolised, because they are a weak or even direct or / or irreversible, raw dependent inhibitor of P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of the Zoleic acid correlated with the cancer drug Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine-Clearance, and was at 64 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">From this makes a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and an excessive cardiac function up to 35 ml / min not contain any dose customization of Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Due to severe kidney disease (creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data are available for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lasting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs were single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal flow.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous use was administered; in total of 6 times (a cumulative dose, which corresponds to 3 times) (a cumulative dose which corresponds to the 7-fold of human therapeutic exposure, relative to AUC, equivalent), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term applications with accumulated application with accumulated excursions, the maximum of the intended human-exposition was sufficient, the toxicological effects of other organs, including the Gastrointestinal rakes and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injury.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common characterization and studies with repeated application was a multi-bit primitive Spongiosa in the metaphyse of long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all doses, a clip and that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, we observed a teratogenicity at doses from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits, no teratogenic effects, or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was ominated at 0.1 mg / kg as a serious serum.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public reveals the present document is a summary of the European Public Research Report (EPAR), which is explained by the committee for Humanarzler (CHMP) to get through recommendations regarding the application of medication.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially oversized patients), where metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not indicated. • It can be used together with other diabetic medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overexposed patients), which can not be adjusted in metformations in the highest tolerable dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with an sulfonylharnine or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonylharnity, or insulin can be retained, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulfonylharnates or the insulin can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better-weighted and the blood sugar level gets better, reducing the type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripleotherapy was investigated; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphfonylharnine, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glycosyliertes hemoglobin, HbA1c), which shows how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of HbA1c value which indicates that the blood glucose levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplea study, the effect of an additional gift from Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphfonylharnine in a decrease of HbA1c values around 0.94%, while the additional gift from placebo to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, in addition to insulin, a decrease of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were tendencies, infections of the upper airways (cold cuts), weight loss and hypoaesthesia (diminished sensitivity compared to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Account of Actos may not be used in patients, possibly more sensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic cetoazidosis (high ketones - acid levels - blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos is used in a monotherapy (with the allfew use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, which is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted the European Commission to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the transport of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until white, round, curved and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS".</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with ulin-insular patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar with insulin had inadequate or incompatibles (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years are no data available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronous cardiovascular disease), the doctor may start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight increasing or eyelids be observed, especially those with reduced kardialer reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight increasing and eyelids be observed when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients with 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and pre-advanced ordinary activities were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase of reports of cardiac insufficiency, however, showed up to an increase of mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased resolution liver cells (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of standard range) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-Spiegel are increased to 3-fold the upper limit of normal range, the liver cells are so soon as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient have developed symptoms, which refer to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vexemptibility, fatigue, appelessness and / or darker harn, are the liver enzyments.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be continued until the procedure will be diverified by clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dosisdependent weight increase, which can touch of fat deposits and is connected in some cases with fluid head.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a group modelution under the therapy with Pioglitazone, a less reduction in mean hemoglobines (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemophylharnine and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 1-2% and the hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased Insulinsensation in patients who received Pioglitazon as oral dual or triple-combination therapy with insulin-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of doses dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the treatment with thiazoldindions, including Pioglitazon, an incing or a loss of diabetic macular deems with a loss of visual acuity reports.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether it is between taking place of pioglitazon and the appearance of macular oeudemons, however, should be aware of a macular declaration of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic agreement should be considered to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events with regard to bone breaks out of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated Group-correction was 1.9 frektures per 100 patient years with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 freighters for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROactive study, a study of cardiovascular events were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 frektures per 100 patient years) who treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 cargo cultures per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patient should be aware of the ability to be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient could wish or that occurs, the treatment is abusing (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for research effects have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics from Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interaction with drugs, which are metabolised by these enzymes metabolism, e.g. orale contrazeptiva, Cyclosporin, Calciumkanoid and HMGCoA Reductasformerly are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC by Pioglitazone to the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulting in a decrease of AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is shown that under treatment with Pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistance of breast cancer, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for real growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data are not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary Change of the Turning and the Brechungsindexes of lens, as they can also be observed with other hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="792">Clinical trials with Pioglitazon came out in clinical trials across three times the upper limit of normal range beyond placebo, but less than in comparison groups below metformin or sulphfonylharnine.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with pre-advanced common disease infection was the incidence of a heavy heart failure failure under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since launching it has rarely been reported to congestive heart failure under Pioglitazone, however, however, if Pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">The summary of messages inappropriate events with regard to bone breaks out of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 7,400 patients in patients treated with the comparative medium-treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years running PROactive study, Fraktures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) who treated with Pioglitazone treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day over seven days have no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work on an activating specific core receptors (Peroxisome proliferator) Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which is in the animal model to a increased incidence of liver, fat and skeleton muscles.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the Glucoseproduction in the liver and peripheral Glucosφ ation in case of an insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">Clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy was continued in order to investigate the time until the therapeutic efficiency of therapeutic efficiency (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years of therapy, a blood glucose control was defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) by Pioglitazone at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar have been discontinued with insulin inhibitor inconsistently, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced to 0.45%, compared to patients who continue to remain ininsulin; a reduction of insulin was observed in the treated with Pioglitazone group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / Kreatinine-Quotians compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks in a study to type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction of the plasma triglyceride and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly slightly, however, significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone fell to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid, the total plasmatriglyceride and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while under the metformin and gliclazid decreased values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced the Nüchtern triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride view, this both via a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROactive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and pre-advanced common disease in groups were randomized, in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy at either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oraler application, Pioglitazone gets quickly resorated, whereby the peak concentrations of Pioglitazone will usually be reached after application 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV endorsed the effectiveness in roughly the three-fold effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies that Pioglitazone could no relevant effect on the Pharmacokinetics or Pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral applying radioactive pioglitazon, the marker was found mainly in the subjects (55%) and to a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of insisted pioglitazon amounts to humans 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolites is 16 to 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The PlasmaConcentration of Pioglitazon and his metabolites are less than in healthy volunteers with randomised cardiac function, whereby the rates of the oral clearing of the womb are resembles.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys connected according to repeated plasm volume enlargement with hemorilution, anaemia and reversient eccentric cardiovy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to that by treatment with Pioglitazone, reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistance of breast cancer, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for real growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (with male rats) of the urbular epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family filamenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidions to an increased frequency of colonies.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white until white, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS".</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated Group-correction was 1.9 frektures per 100 patient years with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 freighters for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROactive study, a study of cardiovascular events were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 frektures per 100 patient years) who treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 cargo cultures per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy was analysed with Pioglitazone or Gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / Kreatinine-Quotians compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced the Nüchtern triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride view, this both over a effect on the Tryglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglicence-synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing in terms of their primary endocrine, respiracy, acute coronous synonization, leg amputation of the leg, coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the legarteries, put the results close to that with taking of Pioglitazone no cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to white, round, flat and carry on one side the markings "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS".</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarized analysis of messages from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years, treated with Pioglitazon and were treated with over 7,400 patients who received a increased incidence of bone breaks for women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROactive study, a study of cardiovascular events were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 frektures per 100 patient years) who treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 cargo cultures per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was involved in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas may not produce ininsulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance was measured after 12 weeks (glycosyliertes hemoglobin (HbA1c), which shows how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease of HbA1c-mirs which indicates that the blood sugar levels were similar to strong like with another human flu.</seg>
<seg id="867">Account of Actraphane should not be used in patients, possibly more sensitive (allergic) to humaninsulin (rDNA) or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adjusted, if it is used together with a number of other drugs, which can operate on blood sugar (complete list of package supplied).</seg>
<seg id="869">The committee for Humanitators (CHMP) has arrived at the end that the advantages of acetaphanane affects the treatment of diabetes against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the European Commission to the Novo Nordisk A / S approval for the transport of Actraphane in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin-products usually become used once or twice daily, if a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer persistent effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be breeds at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar can be significantly improved by an intensive ulin-therapy, the hypoglycemia-warning symptoms can be perceived and should be avoided accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any modification of thickness, brand (manufacturer), insulin typ (fast effective, long-effective insulin etc), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin-on) and / or manufacturing method (due to insulin-animal origin) can result in fact that a change of dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If changing to Actraphane in patients can be necessary, it can be necessary for the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the change.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, with the hypoglycemic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycemia is less pronounced or less than at their precincing insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travel, who should go over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to the advice of his doctor, as such trips, that insulin must be applied to other times and must be used to other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider any possible exchange-effects on the therapy and care of the patient involvement in the other of them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which cannot occur in a non-sufficient diabetic therapy, increasing the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemia may lead to consciousness and / or crushing plants with temporary disruptions of brain function and even to death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system accidentally - peripheral neuropathy can be associated with complaints that are designated as acute painful Neuropathy and usually reversibly.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A Intensive strengthening of the insulin therapy with a corrupt improvement of blood glucose can be connected with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="887">Diabetics should always be grape juice, sweets, cookies or sugar fruit juice with consciousness, treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1,0 mg) by a wisted help or glucose that is given intravenously through the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect will begin within half an hour, the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total effects of the total amount is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorption profile is that it is justified that it is a mixture of insulin-productive with fast or consumables.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of column design (hydrolyse-) locations on human molecule were drawn into consideration; none of the metabolished metabolites is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies for safety, toxicity, toxicity in retracting gift, genotoxicity, to carcinogenic potential and to reproductive stress, the preclinical data have no special danger for the human beings.</seg>

<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on the basis of the ADVATE, which makes a submitting PSURs all 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder will be applied for another 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited was officially approved by the Committee on Humanarzler (CHMP), that the company will take its application for the domestic transport of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue, the other structures in the body connects and supports rest).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus, the genetically transformed that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">With the virus in Advexin, it is a "Adenovirus," that was so modified, that there is no copies of himself and can't solve infections with human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would be injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein which is made from the not defective in the human body existing p53 gene, is normally corrupt the recovery of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells, if the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, while the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein is not really properly, and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company laid data from a study with a patient before, with the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of underwater, in the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP responses to the company's responses to the answers, were still unexplained some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on testing the initially submitted documents, the CHMP submitted a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP section, the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-Tumours was advantages for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns relating to the processing of medication in the body, the administration of administration and safety of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company did not work enough that advise it in reliable way, and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come into contact with the patient, harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company provided the CHMP of which in knowledge if the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently has to participate in clinical trials, or "Compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the active effect of active index means that the tablets are so cleared, that one of the most effective ingredients are immediately released, and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is applied for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal-allergic rhinitis (tubular inflammation of nollen) in patients with nose-skin irritation (corrupt nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily to be a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The treatment duration should be as short as possible and finishes, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose jewels (verge nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of medication should be neglected on the development of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main current dimensions were the changes of the severity of the Heuschnupfymptome which were reported by the patient before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">While the study carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and evaluated using a standard scale, as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">For contemplation of all Heuschnupfymptoms apart from the constipation of the nose reported that Aerinaze participated, over a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35,9% in patients who received the pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose was viewed, the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26,7% in patients receiving the Deskatadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (watched with 1-10 of 100 patients), thumber, psychotitis (appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, Insomnie (insomnia), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may be sensitive (allergic) against Deskatadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenerge active ingredients or Loratadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also be applied in patients who suffer from a engagangle glaucoma (hypertension), cardiac or vascular disease, hyperthyreose (overfunction of thyroid arthritis), or already had a brighorrhagic stroke (caused by a brain bleeding) or have a risk of incinertia.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted a approval for the transport of Aerinaze on the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is immersed in the bugs (i.e. without them to break or towing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should be used due to the absence of data on the effectiveness and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) are not used in children under 12 years.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The application of the application is as short as possible, and should not be continued after waste of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since the term application of pseudoephedrine can take off at the time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decline in the grinding of the mucate in the upper respiratory, the treatment should be continued with Desloratadin than Monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze pseudoephedrine contains the medicine also conferous in patients who treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor will be treated within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combination with pseudoephedrine, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamin, phenylephrine, phenylephrine, Ephedrine, Oxymetazolin, Naphazolin...).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective, and the data will not submit to the recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, not checked, to transfer the recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients must notify me that the treatment is treated with hypertension or a tachromkarle or of palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea or any other neurologic symptoms (such as headaches or an amplification of headaches).</seg>

<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of matological tests, since Antihistamines, otherwise positive reactions to indicators for skin reaction and reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with Deskatadin, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazol were administered, however, no clinically important currency effects or changes of PlasmaConcentration was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In case of the psychotropic tests, no significant differences were detected between Deskate and placebo in placebo, regardless of whether Deskate adin alone or alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">This enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Deskatadin was not identified, so that interaction with other drugs cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Deskatadin shirt in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The implies of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies but no increasing the frequency of abnormalities compared to the incidence of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies of animals are not always applied to humans and transferred to humans of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, the patients should be clarified that it may occur in very rare cases to a impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a ZNS depression (Secoding, Apnoe, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, Koma, cardiovascular Collapse) and a ZNS-stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, Tremor, vulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>

<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastic cells / basophile, as well as inhibiting expression of the expression of the admiration of P-pectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults showed Deskatadin 5 mg, no influence on standard measurement variables of the aviation power including the reinforcing subjective bats or the tasks that are connected with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg, no increased frequency of strokes in comparison to placebo was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The orale application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause more sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tacharkarous or Manifestations of a ZNS-excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal-allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamantagonist effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined using the total value for symptom (except Nasenmuenskin), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine in over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the weakening effect, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic methods.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose-study of Pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze is Deskatadin within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers with 14 days the flow of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of an pharmacokinsic study, which was performed with the formulation of a healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects Deskate adin bad confused.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components of Interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine in the allcouple of pseudoephedrine was equivalent to exposure of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies for safety harassology, for toxicity in retracting gift, for genotoxicity and reproductive aggregate the preclinical data with Deskate, however no special danger will be recognizable for the human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination did no greater toxicity and its individual components, and the observed figures were generally consistent with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used by adults and older people for protection against influenza, which is caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza-A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that may cause a trunk of influenza which may cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A Grippepandemic breaks out, when a new trunk of flu virus is dipped, which can be slightly increased from man, because the people still have no immune system (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the vaccine contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in the position, with a contact with a flu virus like an influential antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the reed valve of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membranes, which detects the human body as physical foreign), cleaned and as an component of the vaccine is used.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Some of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thereby, the scope of clinical data base for the evaluating safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who can't kill the capsules, Agenerase can be taken as a solution for a solution, but it can't be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should be assigned, if the doctor has checked, which has taken an antiviral drug in the patient previously, and the probability has judged that the virus is talking to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with 100 mg of Ritonavir and other antiviral medication.</seg>

<seg id="1910">Aids is not too heal, however, the creation of the immune system, and hence the development of AIDS linked infections and disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicine, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who were previously treated with protease of liquids.</seg>
<seg id="1912">That with low dose of Ritonavir reinforced medicines Agenerase was compared with 206 adults who had previously taken the earlier protease of protein.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-proven concentrations of HIV in blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously had no protease earlier, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children who had been treated with protease earlier than just a few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated previously treated with Protected fibrillation, using Ritonavir enhanced medicines Agenerate the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant against four other protease inhibitor, it came under Agenerase along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks in patients who continued to further previous protease earlier:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (blows), Flatsea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and cattery (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against Amprenavir or one of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetist amplifier Ritonavir but the committee held that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not demonstrated proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was supposed to be admitted under "extraordinary circumstances" since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission approved the Glaxo Group Limited a approval for the transport of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is in combination with other antiretroviral medication for treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor (PI) treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For this, Agenerase capsules of Pharmacokinir can be administered with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should be taking into consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The Bioveravailability of Amprenavir as a solution for entry is 14% lower than of Amprenavir than capsules; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for entry to a milligrams of a milligram basis is not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules without the amplification of Ritonavir (Booadding), must be applied higher doses to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protein types were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data on the integrity and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinic data, the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with a serious liver function on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with serious liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use in patients with mild or similar liver function is done with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is impacted (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines to have a small therapeutic width and also substrate of cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetal preparations, the curiskraut (hypericum perforatum), may not be applied due to risk of reducing plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effects of Amprenavir during taking of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to healing the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present-retroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase prevents the risk of a transfer of HIV on other by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenerase capsules together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medication used (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis set the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in terms of output value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, at a non-sub-level threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The effectiveness of the efficacy of unboxed Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with 288 HIV infections at the age of 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was measured in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosified Ritonavir simultaneously; the majority of the patients treated with PI treated patients had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the study included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml at a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be optimised with PI pre-treated children of the expected value of "non-testosterone" Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) amounts until the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for Cmax contrast to 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after the dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous dietary intake is influenced the extent and the rate of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent divisible volume of about 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can close to a large distribution volume, and an uncovered penetration of Amprenavir of the blood circulation to the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of total concentration in plasma, with the quantity of unbound Amprenavir which remains the active share, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir constantly remain constant, the percentage of percentage of free active ingredients during the dosing intervals in the Steady state above the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, the CYP3A4 inducing or inhibited or a substrate of CYP3A4 indicate if they are given to be given with Agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposition as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is one of the solution 14% less biodeclassified as of the capsules; therefore Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a millimeter basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearing of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of a cardiac disease is likely to be low to elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This treatment schemata lead to Amprenavir-plasmasks comparable to healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also be monitored for these patients, and the infusion of Aldurazyms should be made only in a reasonable clinical environment, where resting equipment for medical emergencies are now available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase form, usually within 3 months from treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients, antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction, must be treated when applying Aldurazyms (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="2303">Since there were no data based on natives that were exported to Laronidase across the mother's milk, is recommended to prescribed during the treatment with Aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were randomized mainly as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study with 5 years of treatment (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medicines-interactions in connection with aldurations that were observed during the phase 3 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequently used in the following table following the following frequency: very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with serious MPS-I-conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistoric times, another reactions were up, including bronchospasm, respiratory bowls and facial (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2309">In most cases, it came to a serokonversion within 3 months after the treatment of a serokonversion, most of the patients undergone up to a serokonversion (mean after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the phase 3 study (or until preceding out from the study) were detected in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay internally detected antibodies, including three patients who never had to Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with defaulted to a low-old mirror showed a robust reduction of the Gag-Miracle in Harn, while patients with high antibodies of anti-antibodies had a variable reduction of Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed marginally to small neutralising inhibitor activity in vitro, which does not affect clinical efficacy and / or decreasing of Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies of antibodies are not in connection with the incidence of immense drug-interactions, even if the occurrence of unwanted pharmaceutical-interactions are typically ed with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for Enzymeric therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of accumulated substitute, and reducing an additional accumulation of enzymes.</seg>

<seg id="2319">Primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and absolute salute in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with aldurations treated patients compared to the placebo group, improving the lung function and the capability that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, improving an improvement and / or recession of this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyms / Aldurazyms group and a group of 182 weeks in the placebo-group, as follows the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FEV is not statistically significant and the absolute lung-volumes increased significantly proportional to body size.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From 26 patients with a hepatomegalie treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study is a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease of the Gag mirror in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinine) was determined that remained constant at the end of the course.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patient, the clinical significant changes related to 5 patients (58%), was generally consistent with 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a decrease in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old open phase-2 study carried out in mainly the safety and pharmacokinic of Aldurazyms were investigated by 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with the heavy version form and 4 with the middle-running form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage for increased GAG- mirror increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and a weight increase (n = 3) was found after the Z-score for this age-running form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle-run form, probably limited to the older patients with severe contamination only limited or even any progress in cognitive development.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used by chemotherapies, which are strong desoluble for nausea and vomiting (like Cisplatin), as well as with Chemotherapies, the trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi may be increased by an additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as Antiemetikum).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended, because the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance fills of an chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults, the chemotherapies received severe or moderate effect for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong performance soluble for nausea and vomiting, 59% of those patients treated with Aloxi, treated with Aloxi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy alone (132 of 223), treated with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">By Chemotherapies, the moderate deemer of nausea and vomiting, showed 81% of patients who treated with Aloxi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy alone (153 of 185), treated with Ondansetron patients (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values at 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the European Commission of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the transport of Aloxi in the total of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed as prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenetics and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate emetoing chemotherapy due to cancer cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi on prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one before the given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron may extend the thickest passage, patients should be monitored with an amnesty oripation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Like with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, the caution of pallonosetron with medication used to extend the QT interval or in patients, with which the QT- interval is extended or to achieve an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemotherapeutics, Aloxi in days after chemotherapy was not used to prevent nausea and vomiting for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials, the resistance of the five analysed chemotherapeutics cannot (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose Palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population based pharmacokinic analysis (Amiodaron, chlorine ethylene, chlorine, Cimetidin, Fluoxetin, Haloperidol, oxtralin, Ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on clearing from Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences about the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not applied, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women, unless it is required by the doctor's doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly with Aloxi in the context, headache (9%) and orcharity (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity and reactions on the appointments (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar numbers of unwanted events were similar to the other dosages; there were no dose-effective relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies, however, due to the large distribution volume, however, is probably not effective therapy with a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind study showed a total of 1,132 mg / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 intravenous (half-time 7,3 hours) received intravenously per day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>

<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate emetoing chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenotype are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indicating chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of the clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block at the ventricular De- and reporter of Ionenkanals and extend the duration of the shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="2635">Aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers performed the assessment of ECG effects from i.v. administered Palonosetron in single dots of 0.25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption To intravenous gift follows an initial decrease of plasma concentration in an initial elimination of the body with an average terminale of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportionally disproportionately in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift from Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, there were 5 measured average (± SD) increase in Palonosetron PlasmaConcentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinic simulations, that, at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached overall exposition (AUC0- ∞) that was comparable to 0.75 mg of measured value; however, the Cmax after the one-off value of 0.75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by kidneys and eliminated about another 50% in two primary metabolites, which have in comparison to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonist effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies to metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lower measurements, the IsoymenzymCYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron are involved.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine relocated, Palonosetron as an unmodified active ingredient; approx. 40% of the given dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a unique intravenous Bolusinprojection at Gesunden was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing at 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver abnormalities, the terminale elimination upward and the average systemic exposition with Palonosetron increases reducing the dose which is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions, which will be considered sufficient for clinical use of therapeutic exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 of preclinical trials took notices that Palonosetron can be blocked in very high concentrations of Ionic channels, which can take part in ventricular De- and Reposization.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose said in about the 30s of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily for two years, led to a combined frequency of liver tumors, pituitary, pancreas, outnierenmark) and skin tumours with rats, but not for mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used doses and da Aloxi in human application, the relevance of these results as low as human being weighted.</seg>

<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of bacterienzelle, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The effectiveness of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was bottled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients conducted by Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of inferious Hautwald showed altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together, they said about 90% of patients contributed to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo has been identified during the treatment of Abszessen (time filled with cement fabric) or infections that caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common secondary effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1-10 of 100 patients) is a friction at the order point.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The committee for Humanitators (CHMP) has reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo to the short-surface treatment of the following common skin infection, compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, bends or stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the transport of Altargo to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvement occurred within two to three days, should still be investigated again and a alternatives in subject (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a Sensibilateral or heavy-local decimation through the application of Retapambulin Salbe, the treatment should be carefully analysed and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is to be used to treat infections, where MRSA is known as a respiration or probably (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary wounds, the efficacy of Retapamanian in patients with infections, caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were unsufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is considered to be considered, if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of infectious place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to its low plasma concentrations, that reaches human skin or infected high-quality wounds in vivo, the clinical obvious inhibition is not expected in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After-time orderly treatment of 2 times a day, 200 mg of Ketoconazol increased the average Saviamash of AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased to a healthy skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposition of topical application in patients are not required, if the topical Retaprium is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have demonstrated a reproduction to oral, and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fötale / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be applied during pregnancy during pregnancy, when a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the use of Retapamash of the gift of a systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In the decision whether the stoves continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo will continue / ended, is between the benefits of the nursing and the benefit of altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials to 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo applied, the most common reported inspiratory effect was reported by the appointment of approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from Clitopilus passeckerianus (former Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding station of the 50S subscale of the bacterial ribosoms which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interacting substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the engbosomales protein L3 is involved and in the region of ribosomal P-engagement and the peptidyltransferring centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through binding on this binoculums Pleuromutiline des peptidyltransfer, block partial P-engagement of interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be on the reason of the local prevalence of resistance the use of Retapamulin at least some infections show, should be advised by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in-vitro activity of Retapambulin versus S.AUREUS, regardless of whether the isolate sensitive or resistant to methicillin were.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-speaking treatment in S.AUREUS, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Pantone-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults was put 1% Retapambulin Salbe daily under occlusion to intacte and put on weapron skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapambulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secundane infected wounds, individual plasma welding were won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sample ceremony took place on the days 3 or 4 in adult patients, before the median of media and with the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording at the people of topical use of 1% Salbe on 200 cm2 beating skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapambululin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamanian in human liver microsomes was primarily used by CYP3A4, under the low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In trials for the oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma testing or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-microcore to the in-vivo study.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither in male nor with female rats's restriction at oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which thus achieves up to 5 times higher exposure position as the highest estimated exposure of people (topical application to 200 cm2):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were detected at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the estimated human body), development aid (reduced body weight of the fettus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for the transport system must ensure that a pharmaceutical company is present, as specified in the module 1.8.1 of the regulatory order (version 6.2) and will be used before the product will be marketed and is used as long as the proven product is applied.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases associated with the liver affecting the liver between a and 15 years) that are not immunity for these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of one of two doses of existing vaccination, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason why Ambirix may be used, if the immunisation is a lower risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccines can be led to the end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a collection of hepatitis A or B is required, Ambirix, or other hepatitis A- or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines require by using the immune system (the natural defende of the body), "as it can be against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognize the viruses and surface antigens as a "foreign" and creates antibodies in contrast.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix Adults and the vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same disease, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given an existing vaccination program.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix Adults identical ingredients contain some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a cover for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed one month after the last injection of anti-protective anti-confederations.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of vaccine is compared to a six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection for developing antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of ambient temperature of Ambirix was similar to a six-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headaches, appetizer, pain in the injection point, carrying, activity (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may cause severe sensitive to active (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 shared the European Commission to the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a approval for the domestic transport of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard timetable plan for the primers with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, with the first dose on the date and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection of hepatitis A is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovine vaccines or using a combination simulations.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The Anti-Hepatitis B virus (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size such as after vaccine with the respective monovine vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is still not secured whether immune competent people who require a hepatitis A- vaccines as well as protection, because they are not protected by the immune memorial by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 How to all injection simulations should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the Standardimpfschema is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">For hemodialysis patient and persons with disorders of the immune system, there is no striped out of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS anti-antibodies, so that in these cases the gift of other vaccine is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since a non-thin injection or intramuscular administration, could lead to a suboptimal imprecy, these injectors should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, at Thrombozytopenia or blood coagulation can be injected, however, it can be injected as possible in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, Tetanus-, azellular organisms type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or combined with a combined Masern- mumaster vaccine was sufficient to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunoressiver therapy, or in patients with immundefects, no sufficient immune response has to be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was carried out with 3 vaccine of these formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, roenteritis, headache and fever, comparable to the incidence that was observed in earlier thiomerate and preservative-based vaccine formulation was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 were administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix with the 3-cans combinations was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matters at a daily basis for vaccination, but not based on a calculations.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain has been observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50,7% of the subjects, compared with 39,1% in the subjects after the gift of a 3-doses-combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccine cycle, 66,4% of the subjects who had been administered by pain, over 63.8% for subjects who were vaccinated with a 3-dose combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of mateness was comparable high (i.e. the total vaccination cycle at 39,6% of subjects, the Ambirix, compared with 36,2% for subjects who received 3-doses-combinations possible).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The prevalence of pronounced pain and matters was low and comparable to administration of combination with the 3-tine vaccine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study at 1-11-year-old vaccination was comparable to localreactions and general actions in the Ambirixgroup with the addition of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, during the 6- 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a common disappearance of pain (in the injection of injection) per dose, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vacclingen, which had severe adverse events during the 2-tins vaccines with a combination of 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombined hepatitis C virus, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were conducted at vaccination at the age of 1 and including 15 years, the Serokonversionsrates were carried out after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to the month 6 abbreed dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Serokonversionsrates for Anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose, and 100% one month after the second, to the month 6 abbreed dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study that was carried out with 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 the standard combined-in combination with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogeneity rates were significant (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose which was significantly higher than Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, in a clinical comparison study at 1-11-year-old one month after the termination of the full vaccination (i.e., in month 7) were achieved, are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines received either a 2-tine vaccines with Ambirix or a 3-tine vaccines with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were at the time of primers between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens was comparable to both antigens, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study with 12 to 15-year-old clinical trial, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS anti-Anti-Anti-Anti-Anti-Anti-Anti-Anti-Inputs is comparable to the 0-6 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose is Ambirix in the second year of life with the collection of a combined diphther-, inactivated polystyrene (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined Masers-mumps-raw vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study that was carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults, showed similar formulation of seroprotational and serokonversionsrates such as earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2785">In a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor may absent you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A- / hepatitis B vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of an recombined Hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>

<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with disorders, since there is a risk for the emergence of eco-ophagusulcera when the tablets cannot come into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g Sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should be insufficiency with congestive heart failure or severe cardiac insufficiency, as well as with sodium carbonate and anti-formation clinical trials are used only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of Sodium phenylbutyrate is performed on the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used with liver or kidney insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore condenser (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At subkutan heritage of Phenyl acetate to young rats (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with "acute Koronarsynchronous" (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), for example at instabiler Angina (heart attack) or myokardinfree (heart failure) without "ST- Hebung" (an anomal measuring value of electrocardiac or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to detect blood clots in patients who used a PCI, a higher dose, and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with Angina or heart attack on blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS part in which the effect of Angiox for allsome gift or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for the prevention of blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anti-antiagulans) and a GPI.</seg>

<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was just as effective as Heparin, except at heavy bleeding, with which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used to be used in patients who are possibly more sensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other brain or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be applied in patients who had a blood disinfection, as well as people with a strong hypertension, or severe cardioid problems or heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The committee for Humanitators (CHMP) has reached the conclusion that Angiox's treatment in the treatment of ACS and a PCI is an incomparable substitute for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the corporation Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the transport of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsynchronous (instated Angina / non-ST-Hebrides) (IA / NSTEMI)) for an emergency aid or if an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initials of Angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous Bolusability of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by a infusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If in the patient in another episode one PCI is carried out, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion for the duration of surgery on 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a Bolusation of 0.5 mg / kg, followed by a infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consisting of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one is immediately followed by intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allfew Bolus gift from Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) should be reduced to below 225 seconds, a second Bolusal of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the expense of low ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted drugs in front of the application should be carefully mixed and the Bolusal dose may be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided, the 1.75 mg / kg Infusionsdosis is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with middle severe cardioid restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which should be subjected to a PCI board (either with Bivalirudin versus ACS or not), should be used a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second Bolusdose of 0.3 mg / kg is achieved and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second Boluseum.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney compensation, which led to the approval of III- PCI-study (replace-2), the ACT value was 5 minutes after the treatment of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose customization at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>

<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is available as subcutaneous injection either in the range of abdominal vintment, to apply mutual infusion in the range of abdominal coating in the range of abdominal cord.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Gluconogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin delivery can be set up in patients with an limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any changing of the effects, the brand (Her- Steller), the Insulintyps (normally, NPH, zinkhesitates etc), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change of insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or breakdown in a treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic cetoazidosis; these states are potentially life.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Withdrawal of a patient on one other ininsulin type or insulin one another manufacturer should be taken under strict medical supervision and can be needed to change the dosage.</seg>

<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as Betbells, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin the symptoms of adrenergen shall be weaker, or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments on reproductive elasticity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human genital in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin injected into human milk's milk, but generally occurs insulin either into the breast milk, nor is resorated after oraler applications.</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with consciousness can be given by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucose (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by intravenous gift by glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">According to a glucose levels, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur- matter for the severe hypoglycemia and similar events.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood glucose levels through the stimulation of the peripheral glucose (especially through skeleton muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucoseproduction in the liver.</seg>
