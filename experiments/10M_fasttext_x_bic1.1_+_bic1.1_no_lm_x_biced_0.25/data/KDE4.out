a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can &apos;t display at all , if the surface is available for representation in the sign of Tre@@ em@@ ap . moreover , you can define the relative position of lab@@ elling in the rectangle .
when sel@@ ective algorith@@ ms should be observed that the surface is propor@@ tional to the size of this was . during the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view ; this purpose will not always be shown . NOTE that less space is lost to the frame , if the rectangle is square .
as an arrangement of the area of an entry for the subject entries , it remains to implement the implementation , and to avoid@@ ing space for lack of space , the best methods are square . the best methods of these are these lines , columns or recru@@ it@@ sive second .
you can define the minimal surface for an entry about the menu entry . instead , a space pattern is written in the area of the superior version , to indicate that this area is actually defined by an un@@ law@@ ful entry .

modern digital cameras are character@@ ised by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or FireWire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will also be realised as a record transmission . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( PT@@ P ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera cameras , which has developed a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras supported by the International Im@@ aging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to b@@ ills and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos generally are completely ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports this cameras and leads the transmission of the images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if added support from the digi@@ pe@@ am reliable . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you will be able to look like nothing or the creation could be very slowly .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins interface Project ( Manual ) is a joint venture structure for &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Show@@ im@@ g and G@@ wen@@ view . target is to provide the modules for all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can use pictures in almost any way man@@ ipul@@ ating , as it can also use a user . your advantage is that it can be considerably easier , &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; by writing a small Modul@@ s to compl@@ ement a function as the changes in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; even to perform .
to simp@@ lif@@ y the window , you can easily remove either the page size with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + converter .

another mode is better suited to show quickly from a picture series , then you will show the left mouse button on any of the tool@@ bar , in order to display it in the left side . this is shown in the right in the right range . this is simplified with a number of similar images .
of course the normal soldering actions are also working directly from the illumin@@ ance how to edit the F4 file ...
all image information from the right side bar of the main body are available in the light table . this makes it easy to link the visual differences with exposure data .
in the bottom of each area you can find a built @-@ in sh@@ elling function , you have to recognize those click on the visible area of the picture , you have to click here and the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom works as in other views . do just use the zoom controllers under the images or Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zo@@ oming in the picture and out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital data management - apart from the fashion word ? digital matter how the image has been taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos will be sc@@ anned , sc@@ anned or digital photos , but most of us do not make it in a system@@ atic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips like you can find your pictures , find , protect and photos again . we consider the download , ren@@ dering , conc@@ ept@@ ing , evalu@@ ate , evalu@@ ate , wait , wait , wait , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , sear@@ ches , trans@@ form@@ ulated , assembled and exported content that hab@@ its a mon@@ ella or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are according to your definition data , information about or a documentation of other data , which are managed by an application or environment .
I need to claim that if you don &apos;t know more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you don &apos;t use it and dig@@ ik@@ am ; . the approach to store both in a database and a secure archives on which you can access to other programs , platforms and formats .
the first what you do and know what your system must be organized in contrast to the data structure . their image files must have to store if other access to your photos , whether you want to store up a reserv@@ oir or etc ; Be@@ ware that you need to change somet@@ ime to a larger image .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your storage site . if you organize enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a file for pictures you print or on a page .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiv@@ ing , work processes , constant supply of images to different them@@ es and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files , and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit ? the separation of file types makes the for@@ kli@@ fts easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files uses a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for one original or a derived photo .
we also suggest the met@@ ad@@ ata store in the integration of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . if you don &apos;t forget this , you can select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by using the menu album the appropriate point .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want ? do you make a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attri@@ butes . these are the most important .
now , as you start the real work , since you can select all images , select the same attri@@ bute , select all the images that will need the same attri@@ bute . this makes sense to focus on the best with the rating or leaderboard . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best pictures .
let us now leave with j@@ ars , key words , as you continue with other programs often , or categories continue . all three are syn@@ on@@ ym@@ s for the same thing .
if you have catalog@@ u@@ ed pictures from another source with built @-@ in key@@ boards , then it is no problem to build the pictures on the right spot . the change of the hier@@ archy is no problem and can easily be replaced by using a sub @-@ tree to another . the modified pass@@ words are per@@ sec@@ uted by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; updated while the trees are per@@ sec@@ uted .
the graphics shows such as different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very rough rep@@ orter , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata is composed of many sections . fil@@ ename and calendar data features of all images .
enough of the pass@@ words - the nearest section refers to lab@@ elling or comments , the third major tool to kat@@ ize your met@@ ad@@ ata .
they want to see most of them all photos , you want to see them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are secu@@ rely on how to get your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not yet a beautiful beach panoramic . if you see it closer , then catch some details to see , people , the place .
and now I say you that this is the landing point of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may hear the silence . the lab@@ elling has completely changed this panorama .
for others , consider the title might be more important than the image itself to create a interest . if you show images you should tell us a history . remember that the key is to help him the meaning that it moves to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a painting is not perfect if the strength has only work with a lab@@ elling for itself alone .
with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you can use any text in an international alph@@ abet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ elling . you can also export it to your wishes to your wishes to the label and / or the title of web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you must not tell the story for the opening ceremony .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system , the Earth was not a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth &apos;s Earth ? good , because with pictures the train on the sp@@ ati@@ al presentation is now already with light speed .
the possibilities offered by Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ ation are already in@@ numer@@ able and can be able to open your travel through pictures with geograph@@ ical data . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . you can also show the photos at the recording location . you can also export the photos to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Earth view .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ rights is a word game with copyright and called the practice of copyright to remove limit@@ ations about the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also applicable in all changed versions , so also for the work of other .
the following description tells you what information is stored on the information page of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; as information is required :

it is very important to fill the author and copyright . everyone who has no protection against ab@@ use . everyone who has any protection against ab@@ use can be clear or modify . the solution for this problem is only digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .

of course we &apos;re talking about CDs on the road or a fire . this type of r@@ lu@@ sten are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section , there are some problems with the so @-@ called New media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data acquisition company in the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons for data loss .
in order to t@@ ack@@ le the problem with CDs / DVDs and you may have no more expensive than a few years . of course you can get CDs and DVDs in archiv@@ ing quality . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe that is in your di@@ arr@@ ative space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk to make good dis@@ ks and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you &apos;re writing a lot of reliable . it is so far to choose the right .
CDs and DVDs are very ob@@ sol@@ ete for error , even if you have just been written . therefore , the rest are only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ att@@ ing and control towers . despite this massive protective cover , ultra @-@ violet light , cr@@ at@@ zer , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works on CDs and DVDs . it also runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the cor@@ rupt data of damaged dis@@ ks , hard drives , flash@@ media , USB drive etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray disc appear to win the format pre @-@ war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything was told , of course also for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burning the media with a good recording of high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . Read the media with a description , date &amp; author license and afterwards protected the data on the next generation of media . don &apos;t forget to read the latest hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ wing manufacturers re@@ tain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer enc@@ om@@ es include a new disk , but not the data . Google lists a big field study about the error mechan@@ isms of hard dis@@ ks : flo@@ ppy dis@@ advantages
soon : dis@@ ks keep at the longest in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error correction , SM@@ ART can not set this error . some of SM@@ ART ass@@ aul@@ ts this error . these are the expected lifetime of life . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only around the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also backed data loss due to one power if you have backed files , but these losses can easily produce no large problems .
while most of the electric devices have not com@@ prised lots of machines . these can cause severe damage . these can cause severe damage , hardware loss , destro@@ ying mot@@ her@@ boards and other def@@ ects . protect themselves before the un@@ avoid@@ able up to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power tips is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absor@@ bed and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in connector . however , it is usually possible to contain any over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure to protects the protection against flash or so that it protects the correctly connected devices .
as a over@@ voltage each cable can use any cable , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als can also be connected to your system . some manufacturers are also included to your modem . others offer connectivity options for your modem . others offer connectivity options for co@@ axial cables and the TV map .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these tools are especially devel@@ opped for not@@ e@@ books and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for on the road .
while a over@@ voltage protection your system is stored in the power lines , it is not really help you in a complete case . even a failure of few seconds can result in the loss of infin@@ ite data . it can therefore be mean@@ ing@@ ful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection of over@@ vol@@ t@@ ages these devices will automatically make up your data . some models allow them to work up to the power . if you get a US@@ V , you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements like a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of battery and the supplied software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that you can be sub@@ jected to your RE@@ CH@@ N@@ ER@@ SYSTEM , and compare its safety with electricity , you can think for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you think . at the end you should always remember any cables just before you can ride in the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a backup target for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular deal with any quantities of data .
they are in comparison to the hard dis@@ ks , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send data about the compar@@ atively durable Internet .
solutions are therefore just as solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yah@@ oo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online . for $ 25 per year you can get un@@ limited storage that should not be reviewed in reality .
from sight of data backup are the web solutions very safe . transfer errors will be automatically adjusted and with the large companies , in the offer a backup and a reduced memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ able .
the graph illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are due to transmission errors . the file system will provide at least the data integr@@ ity between operating system and hard drive .
this is the worst thing that nobody has occurred when it happened in your hardware . all these dis@@ rup@@ tions can &apos;t be found in your computer . nobody seems to have any protection . nobody seems to have thought that it seems to have thought on . the Internet with his TCP protocols is a significantly safe data road than the in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ e@@ fer@@ encies within the data flow . they remain un@@ noticed that error .
even if you are currently affected by transmission problems , you should look at the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of error per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates that can be able to be able with turn@@ outs on low level and is available under one of the G@@ PL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . Read this article in English .
Or@@ acle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still used in Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechan@@ isms that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
this doesn &apos;t estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in notebook and 46 % for the workplace systems . for not@@ e@@ books , the percentage of the@@ ft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the most important damage . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know only a few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; so long no longer exposed .
open source file systems are less ob@@ sol@@ ete for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . a very good English articles found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avo@@ ided . if a file not completely stored before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , the@@ ft and human error are the major cause for data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 flas@@ hing settings of fundamental physical limits . the technology is that the technology is further developed for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sens@@ ors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end @-@ quality opti@@ cs are optim@@ ised for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have a full size sensor ( 24x@@ 36mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive can be responsible for $ 100 &amp; euro ; so do you apply any other for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss . secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you can make something more dangerous such as the new installation of your operating system , exchange from discs or the size change of hard dis@@ ks .
supp@@ ose your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , if the drive is not connected , if the drive is not connected to the moment .
a disaster pro@@ poses loc@@ ally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ plane : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ rows are dangerous for your data . they are normally a whole room or whole house .
this means Des@@ ast@@ erv@@ or@@ am always means a not local storage . bring your f@@ uses the stairs up to the neighbor@@ ing house , in your office or similar .
there is a further advantage of the physical separation : as above already has been a common reason for a data loss in spite of secur@@ ing the pan@@ ic . if you use a backup is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete fuse : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a moment of mom@@ ents without history and represents a complete copy of a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete mom@@ ents up to two times : the complete backup and the last differenti@@ als .
continuous backup : a backup of the files has been changed since the last backup . you can re@@ build the original status in any time . this fuse comes to another backup system in the next with the exception that it is only sam@@ pled and not ongoing .
R@@ sync is a wonderful tool which can easily be able to create your machines . in contrast to script files or other types of file transfer@@ ed r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase safety above ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time you come up a whole daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , one weekly mom@@ ents for each month . each additional th@@ inner should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
them@@ es : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC files , re@@ tain X@@ MP files , original keep , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ find pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual devices , ... , use of Internet .
with this valuable pictures the next 40 year sur@@ vive , that is approximately the period of you really interested in you , because they are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
because the future is un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable due to your nature , everything is predicted with inten@@ tion and re@@ alize during the time . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as the current system is back@@ ward . ever less variations you have used in the past , so it is easier to evalu@@ ate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be based on the ex@@ plan@@ ations in this document . use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : anyway if you change your computer architecture , your storage and f@@ uses technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change an system in its size . this means it is always en@@ large .
let &apos;s go out of which you have put the scal@@ ability with the en@@ de@@ ability and the range that you want to have a dedicated plate or partition . * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; can copy this range and to produce a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record is recognized , but they don &apos;t end it .
&amp; value ; d@@ d if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; resi@@ due 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of trav@@ ag@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software , you can read this yourself . this task will be easier for year to year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary format , which appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PNG was developed as an open source standard , but it can be reliable , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transpar@@ ency . this format is not so many as TIFF needed and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as a picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a reliable compression sal@@ es@@ cal@@ ms ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . it is therefore possible to convert your pictures in this format . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital negatives format is a license @-@ free and open resource image that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the needs of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera system is now available now and we hope to use the compet@@ itors of Canon and Nikon .
this is probably one of the reasons why , in order to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to create your data into one file itself . the file information is provided with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers go ahead of a original of your recording , mostly used in the raw file . however , there may be the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file , and as mentioned above already is reasonable size . therefore , you should use DNG as containers and put everything together .
the Dublin Core met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports any compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , providing a great range of operations and mod@@ eling , discussions and collab@@ orative work in the DC@@ MI workshop , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and ex@@ plan@@ atory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures on the camera carrier , you can use this as a temporary fuse .
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your re@@ pos@@ itory . this function is not implemented yet .
for a sensitive processing , you can use external programs again . if you work with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut down under circumstances from the other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only in Web@@ galleries , enc@@ ode in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; get a description , as you can have photos that you can already have on your hard drive . the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Al@@ ben@@ dat@@ enb@@ ank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; connect this with the calcul@@ ator , on the camera on the display mode , and switch them one . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , try to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ous -@@ indicator will be available on the lower end and the presentation of all photos on the camera . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file extensions for any file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera form@@ ations of each record . with the side@@ bars characteristics and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a updated or his met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog displays file properties and information information to be stored in the intern@@ ally from the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded from your machine . NOTE that at some digital cameras not all information available .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as an Ex@@ if , manufacturer not@@ ation , GPS etc . this information are the same as at the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; or the picture processing . NOTE that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras .
the eas@@ iest way to download photos on your computer , is the click on the button and then you will be deleted from their camera in one single album in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; . downlo@@ ading the photos will not be deleted if the pictures have been downloaded from a album before you can delete photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can choose only the desired using the standard selection method of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button download and then chosen . the button is chosen as long as you have chosen some photos .
if your camera supports this is an option of new image . these pictures have been added to now from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; downloaded . in this case , the new pictures can be downloaded with a star in the feed table . if you download this option , of course only the new images are downloaded .
if you select the buttons stored or chosen file , a dialog appears to read the target album , where the list of exist@@ ent albums , can be displayed as a regular file , displayed in the section of My albums , then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; invites the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete these from the camera , you can delete the button Del@@ ete From once . if you want to delete the button Del@@ ete , you need to select this first and then del@@ eting for extinc@@ tion .
NOTE that there are no way to have deleted photos , which you will be deleted from the camera . they should not be carefully inspec@@ t if the photos were successful in a &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; -@@ album you should be clear from the camera . if you make the camera case you should make it more faster than the camera &apos;s camera because this is considerably faster .
cameras use as fil@@ ename for the photos are often not especially interesting names . that may be converted to double fil@@ ename in the same album . therefore , it can be mean@@ ing@@ ful , the date and time to integ@@ rate the file to integ@@ rate the file names .
in the next section you will find options for turning and sealing conditions . if you use this latter option , automatically created a file per day .
the options as the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos can be stored on the record in the section standard aut@@ onomy . if you select this option , the corresponding entries of the Ex@@ if information can be correc@@ ted in the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correc@@ ted date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you wish to use another date format as the default format , you can use pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % - % d % H : % M : % S . switch on the date and time . for further adjust@@ ments , you should read the help of the command .
if you have to use the option fil@@ ename , you have the opportunity to change the file names in small booking . or in large booking if you prefer .
the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; for a photo is displayed below the name indicates that the camera will be stored in the preview . its settings can be stored and automatically use when you can open the camera table .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; can all use information about the orientation of the camera to start accept@@ ing a automatic rotation during the process . not all cameras do this information . in the section icon Met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that embedded your camera to the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera is not enabled , it can switch &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the button , use the door knob , and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
if your camera is available on the date , at which the photo is available , it can be loaded on the image data . all pictures with the same date are loaded on the image data . all the cameras will be available in the same description . all the cameras are available in the section icon Met@@ a data , you can easily put information on your camera to the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case , it stores &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , then select the button extension and select the option of date @-@ based under@@ side at the bottom end of the window .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way photos from their computer on their camera is to download button . select the upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can choose to up@@ loaded files . you can also select more than a file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after sel@@ ecting the image selection , asks &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you will be loaded up to the images . a file selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired file and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as common concept in this document . this is a position that is indicated in length and latitude . the determination of data can be performed by American GPS , the Russian G@@ LON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographer it can be interesting one picture with a precise geo@@ graphic location . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to kar@@ to@@ graf@@ ting . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural bure@@ ros and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you &apos;ve got later , where the photo was done , you can open a look at another &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; if you want to loc@@ ate the place of photos , it can simply define this aspect of the photos , it is good for the position of a photos .
the question is how to come the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that Ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ r@@ ds and map refer@@ ee . the question is in this fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve these data files and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geograph@@ ical order ( manual ) and last about the manual input of well @-@ known locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has an GPS unit . but there is a few containing GPS recei@@ vers together . either as map module or via trans@@ mit the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR R@@ ico@@ h Pro G3 Sony
downlo@@ ading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save this data in g@@ px format , as this is the only format is supported by the module to the geograph@@ ical order .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data from images and from GPS . you can make the same below &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and wide grave or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ds to be created for instance by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; try to give you as much control over his work flows as possible . there are many adjust@@ ments , select the behavior of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; click on this settings . you can change in the menu dialog box . you can click on the symbols of the left on the left .
the action can be shown on embedded preview or picture processing . you are putting the default behavior of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; fix when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the search dent@@ ity and ur@@ he@@ ber@@ able data . these data will automatically be selected automatically in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . also in a database synchron@@ isation , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
the author is a syn@@ on@@ ymous with syn@@ onym : this field should contain the professional name of photograph@@ ers . this may be design@@ ing photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent photographer . since this is a more detailed description as the author , this also has to be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for Contri@@ but@@ ors : use this field to specify the photo . this is not the author , if this is the picture of another &amp; quot ; an@@ bi@@ eten@@ quot ; . if the image is a storage photograph , then the group or agency should be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . this will reach the met@@ ad@@ ata permanently in the image and not only in the database of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; . these met@@ ad@@ ata is also available to other programs and can be imported without any lost .
picture lab@@ elling as embedded info ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments made by other image capture . NOTE : with pictures that are already contained in pictures that are already labeled by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
the page settings includes all options for information , which appear when the mouse inter is rest@@ less on a file . depending on selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to set the file extensions of this list and remove any file in one &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which is no these extensions , by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; are ig@@ no@@ red .
the default settings can be returned , by using the button on the right from each category .
the settings of the illumin@@ ated by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; can &apos;t be switched on this page . anyway , some pictures have installed different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ gear mode , you should only use only on fast invo@@ ice . if you have one , then you can get a better sigh@@ t@@ seeing results .
by default , the image processing is using a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different colour , you can switch this here . you can use the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full @-@ screen mode .
over@@ weight and under@@ lined areas of a image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colours can be specified here . in the image processing , this sigh@@ t@@ line can be switched off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chrom@@ a @-@ sub@@ sampling , that the pictures in higher resolution of po@@ ems can be enc@@ oded as in a higher resolution , please read this article in Wikipedia to the proximity of the explanation .
with the attitude from PNG files , you can reduce the size of PNG files . the only effect is that the image data is more time to compens@@ ate and un@@ packing . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . it means 1 : low and 9 a high compression .
using the TIFF files you can switch the De@@ fl@@ ate compression sal@@ es@@ m for TIFF . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality , as the De@@ fl@@ ate algorith@@ m works freely .
with the Un@@ less JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can select a loss free . even if you have written the loss of loss , the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . as this paragraph was not supported , but was not supported in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the image processing is only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast to man@@ ip@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal to sensitive lines in output . if you use this option , add this problem with minimal loss of details . this option creates a bit soft , elim@@ inated the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G- or the AHD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . default is it a fixed colour balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card which was photograph@@ ed in the sun@@ light .
this setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that pres@@ cri@@ p@@ ated pictures in four steps more details in the nickname . for other cameras , this option is ig@@ no@@ red .
the standard is the top @-@ lights , so that the parts of your camera will be taking into the settings . using the setting of your camera , it creates some unusual results , since they can try out some parts of the missing information from the pointed tip .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; and dc@@ raw therefore try the lack of green and red . of course this is a question , how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level of level . here is a value of three a com@@ promise and can therefore be adapted for each image separately .
put the Lumin@@ esc@@ ence to your taste . you must probably have somewhat higher than the default 1 . this may also be later in the image options of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing time . to keep time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ waiting small , you should go to the conservative daily .
a demo image algorith@@ m is a digital image process to have a complete picture of the partial image sensor that have many cameras and one matrix colored pixels . this algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or fern construction .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; and D@@ c@@ raw offers three altern@@ atives available : Bil@@ de@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and AHD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m of D@@ c@@ raw material . however , it creates a fast solution to the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result .
if you know the color de@@ viation of your l@@ ent@@ ils , you can place the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is surely the best method for a color correction , because it is carried out during the raw convertible .
a profile transl@@ ates the Far@@ bin@@ form@@ ations and gives instructions like this again . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; for information like the colour space in the other , the colors are as possible as possible .
behavior Ask , if a picture in the image processing is opened / colour management module with s@@ caff@@ old files .
colour profile folders right here the folders , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; investigated these folders then during the start .
the ICC profiles of the ICC profiles are here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can change the open@@ ings of the raw file later .
the color man@@ ages view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ yl@@ l . here are only your pictures colored , not the entire screen .
the input profiles should adjust to the camera table and model that you can use . not all profiles are contained in the same type . there are some such as Canon , which means no color ton@@ m@@ apping or gam@@ ma@@ correct correction . this means that you have to perform the color ton@@ m@@ apping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate you like your image of a device . this is very useful before you can print it as your camera and some colors are therefore extremely satisfied , instead of your printer can rely on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras , it is fair@@ ly ob@@ vious that colour profile for them is intended for the models . unfortunately , there is no table of cameras and pro@@ filed lines here . this response is un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion can recognize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Port@@ ra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is a interface that can support from a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image capture and image processing ; many modules support which have been written to work with any program that supports K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution module has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . select those modules will appear as a new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond . in addition , some entries will be found in the context of the main window menu .
short@@ listed for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set on the Settings link below .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjusted between the images , usually there are 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other an@@ ligh@@ ters are on the met@@ ad@@ ata , or off , which ends in the lower end of the pictures during the display .
the camera characteristics are showing a list of all about time supported cameras . on the right side above exists a knob of the camera which tries to identify a camera which is connected to the computer . among them are the port settings . currently there are serial , USB@@ - and USB / FireWire storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re- ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have a USB@@ - or FireWire @-@ storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / , specify when your camera will be put on .
to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you need to connect the camera with your computer , put them in the display mode and on .
check out if &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can use cam@@ eram@@ an and port manual . after you have created your camera , your camera will be available in the camera .
you can select any any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can add all here .
with the option for the translation of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash display , you can adjust the talk of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; at the del@@ eting of a photos in a album . in the cutting of a photos and del@@ eting of an Alb@@ ums you can find more details .
the re@@ fr@@ action changes due to the right side bar can be shut @-@ silence by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; if you use the changes in the right side bar without any inqu@@ iries . otherwise you need to use the changes with the knob changes .
you can also connect the display of the welcome screen of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; when using the start . this acceler@@ ates the starting point of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
the setting at the start of the new photos are looking for a new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the start time of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; if something from the base folder was deleted , ask &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you , whether it should delete it out of the database .
different color sch@@ em@@ as can be used in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can select below settings design from the tool@@ bar code below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in simple text files , you will find a new design for &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tool . you can view these pictures to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button on a preview of a picture or display of the updated / editing .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; for example . they are not part of your distribution . for more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules are available in section image processing .
a status line at the lower edge of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image .
a menu bar at the top edge and below the tool bar to fast access to the most common functions .
the processing functions of the image processing can change your photos . no of the features will have the original photo , before you use file memory or custom buttons from the tool bar . NOTE that you can &apos;t have the original photo , as soon as you have stored the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image , before you can change it . this can be done with the stor@@ ing file .
as long as you have not stored the photo , you can re@@ produce the original image , re@@ produce or the button &quot; button re@@ produce in tool bar . you then lose any change that you have been conducted at the photo since the last sal@@ aries .
almost any action of the image processing can be easily done or restored . the last promotion can easily be able to re@@ cover editing and re@@ construc@@ t re@@ work from the menu .
if you use this often , you should make the key shorter , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ z to restore Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re@@ produce .
if you want to press the &amp; L@@ MB ; if you want to press points or re@@ produce button in the tool bar at a moment , you will select a text menu . if you select one of the menus , all the promot@@ ions are still restored or restored .
once you start the image processing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same key@@ word in the tool bar , painting high , image below or the entries in the menu file . if you have changed the current photo , you will be asked if you want to back this .
you can find in the photo , and zo@@ oming in the Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu @-@ menu .
to adap@@ t a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ screen mode . if you do not want to use the Es@@ c button . normally , if you do not want to change this in the settings dialog of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; change it from the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; do you see the section on the setup of the image processing .
if you want to print the actual picture , you can print in the menu file image and get the default &amp; cool ; pressure dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole movements . you need to select the images with the standard methods and from the menu album . if you follow the assistant , you need only to meet your choice .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; main window is available at the right edge , which is important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available , without the navigation file , even in the image processing is available , if one of the five ri@@ ders is cli@@ cked :
multiple cli@@ cking click on the same rider , the side@@ bar will appear or van@@ ish in the edge .
in the same file , you can enter the let@@ tering with unlimited size or add . NOTE that all special characters are allowed to be cop@@ ied to the EX@@ IF@@ - und IP@@ TC- Fields , that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are marked according to 2000 characters and are converted to other signs . if you want to use the IP@@ TC lab@@ elling field in other applications , you should notice these limit@@ ations .
after you come to you , use either the button to turn or switch easily into the next image , the lab@@ elling are stored .
in addition to the turn button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , it is always done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata settings the always is written into the pictures .
the section evaluation shows a value sch@@ ema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Search and sorting line . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or using the keyboard cut@@ lets . to evalu@@ ate several pictures at the same time , select these out and use the text menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field of urg@@ ency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for fil@@ tering of the key@@ word , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; session .
the key@@ word tree is adapted to the specified search password . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many pass@@ words .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief for the input of j@@ uni@@ per in a picture series . if you have entered different pass@@ words , these are stored for fast access .
pass@@ words can also be put through a@@ ign@@ ers of the respective check boxes in the tree . all keywords are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures are chosen in the main view and you can select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this is not only applied to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section of the key@@ word filter .
the key@@ word key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the main window with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and sear@@ ches . if in addition , one or more key@@ word filter from the right side is used , only the cut @-@ quantity of these two are displayed . all created pass@@ words are available .
you can also go to Tags and do . supp@@ ose you have chosen several pictures to make you with st@@ ich@@ wor@@ lds . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply define it out of the right side bar and you &apos;ll ask if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a c@@ alender date . the key@@ word filter is selected on a few words . they were chosen with Str@@ g + a , and then put a key@@ word from the right key@@ word to the selection and put there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
these search for changes will be held at every start of the program . you can also be switched under settings .
if you have a rule with and created , it would have to be one or should be it , you can change this easily with a double @-@ click on the text and change in the control range .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which is sought in the database . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the oper@@ ators that is a name or a string , which is already in the database .
for example , you can define an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ed options , you need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button . the options see as follows :

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you have a colour work@@ flow work@@ flow that have actually photograph@@ ed from your camera or scanner with a colored work@@ flow that you can print the colours on your monitor from your camera or scanner of the same , or that you print , or in the web which form them out of your digital dark chamber .
if the topic on color administration comes , then you want to know what buttons must not want to make this tut@@ orials . the sense of this tut@@ orials . in addition , this tut@@ orials will make you sufficient background information about colour management . in addition , you should make links with de@@ eper information , make your own inform@@ al decisions , make your desired result .
if your image work@@ flow can be carried out all six below , then you need to take colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated to the RGB color space . ( further information see below )
your only other image spending is by e @-@ mail or the web where the RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if so is so good works and life for all so easy , why should you use another colour space and make thoughts about colour spo@@ ol@@ ng ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors are really shown below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors which we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ins region , and the colours in the RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour brow@@ sing , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms side and click on info and then click on information About RGB Working spaces .
do I need to do my monitor with my monitor , if I have decided to work only in the RGB color space ?
Yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to work your monitor . if you are working on a RGB of you , then you need to use your monitor on the RGB standard , you must use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five Automatic correc@@ tions to improve the picture in most cases . use it before you can try out a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , ab@@ using , automation and contrast from the menu correc@@ ts automatically , automatic and contrast from your colours . they will have to experim@@ ent with these effects , to see what is best possible at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is scal@@ able for the whole image that the dark point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is so bright as possible without its color sh@@ ady . this function is often a magic correction for pictures of the dark or balanced .
ab@@ orted : this method Adjust@@ ing the lights of the colours of the selected image as it is possible . this means that the compar@@ atively very good results achieved in improvement of the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only ru@@ bb@@ ing . it is a very powerful operation , which works either mir@@ acles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
Automatic @-@ up : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . they determined the dark and bright limits and adjusted the red , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ ogram range .
contrast ratio : this method provides the contrast and the lumin@@ ance of the RGB values of a picture through the lowest and highest values on the maximum range and a re@@ ji@@ ust@@ ing of all values between . this is only visible at selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the white balance sheet is a bit limited to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can occur at far from the original image . if you can carry out the white balance in the shell mode , which is working in 16 @-@ bit mode , so you will drop your ways to correction better .
this tool is based on a white balance sal@@ ute by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ bal . it is starting with the menu entry colours white balance of the picture processing .
the fe@@ eder can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image as well as the preview of target bil@@ ateral . if you want to see the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , then it is enough to click the window .
the target photos features a red mark@@ ers . the lumin@@ ance of the pi@@ ents under this marker is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above will be a hist@@ ogram , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful because , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance . with one button you choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will decide .
the contrast of your result depends on the shade , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow align@@ ment lets you improve the attend@@ ance details of your photos or even down di@@ ment .
tigh@@ tening with the above controls , you should use the color pipette Pip@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture shows selected color to calculate the color temperature of white balance . on this type , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can reset the white balance sheet with the default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ sight Indi@@ c@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pi@@ ent is shown .. you will display the combined income in white balance . this will be displayed in the preview as a pure indicator , and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons stor@@ ing as and shop do exactly this . each setting of white balance you can save here with a text file and store later again .
the knob default settings set all the filter values back to their standard values and the related neutral white balance . NOTE that even neutral settings can be displayed another photo as your original . if you have changed your original image .
you can adjust the co@@ di@@ ers per colour channel of the image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the wide spread JPEG format , 16 bit coding is better for high quality images . this coding are also required more turn@@ tables , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool will open the same dialogue as to edit pipes . it uses the change and assignment of colour profile . colour ton@@ m@@ apping can be carried out by the window for the hel@@ ds . a detailed instructions for use of colour profile can be able to rate the chapter color administration .
another important tool is available in the menu below colors of audio correction . this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner must always do the same error and you can always need the same correction . in the manual for audio correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way of coating problems is to correc@@ ted the tool that you will find at the Grad@@ ation in the menu .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ects provides you four col@@ ouring effects , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and a Can@@ ister filter .
in times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the picture was completed , and afterwards the development of the picture was inver@@ ted . the result was a partially negative of the picture . this tool allows you to rec@@ tif@@ y this interesting effect of this tool .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image what chemical is possible . an additional increase is a negative image that is not created on photo paper .
this is an example of solar power @-@ effect . the original image is ( 1 ) and the arranged ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vid Filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation that he has a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and gl@@ asting . try it , it simply emb@@ ell@@ eth many photos .
Vel@@ via is the market name for a daylight colour film which is made by the Japanese company Fuj@@ if@@ ilm ; and thus a reference for its smooth frame structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated in daylight . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly of which colors are also some Photo@@ graph@@ ers , especially those of which are hardly any landscapes , too much .
the neo @-@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast . the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the sli@@ der repeat strength of the neo @-@ lights . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras have frequently problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to experim@@ ent the different colour effects of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors . all your ju@@ ices can be satisfied with the result . once you are satisfied with the result , you can use the knob O@@ k and you are applied .
if you can do a photo with bad light conditions , you can reduce the brightness of brightness and satur@@ ation a good choice for satur@@ ation . all changes you can try to see you in the preview . if him get the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gradu@@ ation and the simple leu@@ k@@ strength / contrast / gamma value , the tool is very comp@@ lic@@ ated for impro@@ ving the im@@ aging . even if the dialog appears only the field of sli@@ der . concrete the three shooting down below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains an output of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or the selected area . under which , three sliding windows can be stored in the inside , and the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the control of the control , it is possible to move the control and change this picture as the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and the preview of the picture will be viewed as a preview of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box , whether the hist@@ ogram is depic@@ ted with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a constant colour is often domin@@ ating the linear hist@@ ogram of a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic setting is useful .
three Shel@@ ves : the chief for the dark sh@@ ades , the middle for bright tones , and the lowest for middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ ids .
the three colour pin@@ boards can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the values of the shadow , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection values for each area . there are also two controllers can be used in order to change the output values , for example , the output values can be used as background to create something different in the fore@@ ground .
automatic : with this button , the image values apply automatically depending on the intensity setting of the picture .
save as and store : using these buttons can be stored in the file system and later again , Gim@@ p levels is used .
if you are using this mode and the three colour pip@@ et , the input will automatically re@@ use for all shade , means and sun @-@ oils , please click on the preview of the original image to set the values of the hist@@ ogram of red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ exposed Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and indicate that the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator that you will get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result .
below is an example for the align@@ ment of input values used to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left , the half of the original and the target is indicated . the preview can be updated in dependence on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fied channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel of the module :
in addition to this cheese there are two symbols between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures those with a digital camera , mostly the linear mode of a constant colour produces a wide beam . in this case it helps the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode .
if you move a cur@@ ator according to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that this bright tones can correspon@@ d with dark outputs , and add the related image and dark dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ ings on the area you want to change the original value , set the original value on this line and move your point on this line and move your value to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons can be exactly this . each curve can be stored in file system and later . the file format is that Gim@@ p cur@@ vy format .
when you make this method and the three colour pip@@ ettes automatically , the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun . enable you to use the color photos for the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ exposed Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is a indicator that you will get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result .
below , you can see a black @-@ white photo which was correc@@ ted in the Lumin@@ esc@@ ort . Sch@@ atten@@ - and sunny was used with the color ological and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and correct ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ mixer of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels , or the colour sh@@ ades of the photos .
the channel @-@ mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour of the images . you can process it from the menu @-@ channel @-@ mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the paint for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correc@@ ted the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the seat of the window indicates a preview of . the original can be viewed by their own rider .
the preview of target bil@@ ical features a red mark@@ ers . if you are positioned in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to indicate that the respective color value .
the controls are right down below : regulator for red , green and building allow you to mix this channels even if you can enable the appropriate color . this is especially convenient , since you can also enable the tool to generate great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black or white port@@ raits .
sometimes , especially when you mon@@ mic , the reduction of colour is in a visible noise that looks from the color channel that looks different in the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern is different . if that the case , you can improve your Monochrome conversion so you can reduce the colour space first .
stores as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any any bl@@ ender setting you can store up and load . the format file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over@@ exposed Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and indicate that the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator that you will get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result .
below , you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re@@ adjusted . the Lumin@@ anz Store is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the image detail ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was still fascinating due to your crash . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working steps , as colour images simply can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ ment profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film transfer with a green Lin@@ sen@@ ic filter . this looks good at all the scene images and fits perfectly well to port@@ raits against the sky . so similar to 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Green filter .
orange film : sim@@ ulates a black / white film transfer with a orange lens filters . this impro@@ ves landscapes , marit@@ ime scenes and air photos . thus , like the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange film .
Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film transfer with a red lens filters . this creates dram@@ atic pot@@ ent effects and can sim@@ ulate Mond@@ li@@ mat@@ s for the daily time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film transfer with a yellow lens filters . this is the natural color one correction and impro@@ ves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones throughout the sh@@ att@@ age . this is very similar to the process of a printing and re @-@ development in a sep@@ ia . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; Tool tex@@ ture can use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a tex@@ ture to your image , regardless of a color image or not , you can look like a oil painting on a screen , whom St@@ ich of an old master , a pop style portrait from enlar@@ ged points or as a mur@@ al painting on a wall . the menu entry image tex@@ ture can be used for image processing .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter block to the right increases the bond of depth , or three dimensional qu@@ alities on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured is used on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and modified ( 2 ) . parameters relief is set to 200 .
adding the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tool box can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
the eye of an actuator in the bound@@ aries of a photos is not a simple task . an opportunity to keep his attention . this is a psych@@ ological Bar@@ rier for scatter@@ ing eye . under the picture frame , the module can start from the picture processing .
type : with this parameter set the desired box type for your image . through an easy line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , ab@@ bre@@ ed with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button@@ hole and decor@@ atively inserted a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specif@@ ies the width of frame in percent . the value for the width is limited by 1 % to 50 % .
this is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of images , especially if you have used the tool after side ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily add one @-@ format text in a picture of any place . this also takes you to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive . enter text and placing it with the mouse . use text exposure , orientation , colour from the colour space and the character set with its characteristics as you need to be the character set . for the end , simply choose a frame for the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . this is the picture is finished .
any setting you have chosen for your text , can be changed to the button &quot; OK . after the image once was stored , the text part of the picture . it can &apos;t be changed .
apply with the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tool Tem@@ plate may apply a template about a picture .
the menu image st@@ encil can be used in the image processing can be used to put on an image via a picture .
for the st@@ encil there is no restri@@ ctions on the size and orientation . you have to add the PNG file format and should you want to add it with maximum compression ( 9 ) to add it an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; mail@@ ing@@ list dig@@ ik@@ am @-@ Us@@ ers @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you have to set your st@@ encil file in the dialog . select the st@@ encil files . these settings will be made for the next start .
after the root file for the tem@@ plates , a building inten@@ tion to refle@@ cts the ord@@ inal correction of the st@@ encil template . the option of a folder is being updated automatically .
under the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this button is enlar@@ ged the shown picture . it will be cent@@ ered for the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
cl@@ adding this button in this button . it will be cent@@ ered to the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template for the whole image , you must check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the picture below the template . take this picture and put it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your picture . the picture will then be adapted to automatically .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; presents three different tools to boost the sharp@@ ening . each of you have pre @-@ extrac@@ ts in other areas .
sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but creates , particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
sharp@@ ens mask works on the contrast of the edges of the edges . actually , it is no bit , it works rather psych@@ ological Dun@@ es and it makes it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three , since he really has improved the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more comp@@ lic@@ ated in its application and has different parameters to adap@@ t .
photos without focus and most digit@@ alised images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this means that sharp edges can be printed with only minim@@ ized edges . the same phenom@@ enon can normally be printed on paper . SLR cameras do normally require more afterwards sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , a camera internal sharp@@ ening has been applied . pictures in the raw format , however , must always be p@@ oured in during processing .
some scanner apply a sharp@@ ening filter already during the reading of the picture . if you enable this de@@ activ@@ ate , you get the control over your image .
in some situations you can usable results by using a photo with the sharp@@ ening tool . you can upgrade with the menu entry .
they should be careful but because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ening of the edges , but also enh@@ ancing the noise . in general , it is necessary to upgrade the menu entry . you can reach more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite issue : a painting is cr@@ acked , it is considerably easier than it . use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry , and experim@@ enting something with settings . the fe@@ eder opening on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ certain@@ ty is a very good tool to remove sand@@ ing from your photos . a demonstration can see here .
the original image and the preview can help the image . the fe@@ eds shows the output of the Fil@@ ters with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are frequently good results and should increase the effect . if you make the shar@@ pen mask to be strong , smoking and impression of gr@@ ats near sharp edges .
the radius makes a bit like many pixels on each side of an edge through the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ os . they should be the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the promised image that will be added to the original . this means the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a break from the maximum RGB values and to apply difference amount . it can be determined by a minimum difference between the sounds of sharp@@ ening and therefore beauty errors in faces , Himm@@ ler and water surfaces .
this is an example for the un@@ sharp filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tool is focused on a picture through impro@@ ving the sharp@@ ness . it used the ur@@ he@@ ber@@ able dis@@ cri@@ mination filter algorith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; maint@@ aining a picture of sharp@@ ens . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters . this is using a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ing . it is usually achieved better results than un@@ sharp mask . it can start from the menu by using colours re@@ focus on picture processing .
in practice the circular pressure is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; ash has a very long tail , which is also affected by the original qu@@ est pixel , which is far influ@@ enced by the Gau@@ ß &apos; f@@ verse in most cases even very strong from the remote @-@ date results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameters for use this module . it is the most important parameters for use of this module . you can set a higher value if your image should be very un@@ sharp , but then you should pay attention .
cor@@ relation : an increase of cor@@ relation can be reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . the cor@@ relation can be reduced to 0.5 and the values above 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ k effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can be reduced by value of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are less than 0.1 rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a good value is 0.03 . a high value is still dil@@ uted .
Gau@@ ß &apos; sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should use this value to 0 if you use a value zero , so you might have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
mat size : this value determin@@ es good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; . NOTE that the module is very slowly if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the store and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any any reproduction parameters can be stored for later , and can then be loaded later .
try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture on the other . the reason is that much operations changes the not immediately visible , but later to leave un@@ pleasant art@@ e@@ facts .
if you are reading pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should use the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked better results than sharp@@ ening . this might be caused by causing the un@@ sharp mask a larger neighborhood more than sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ ti@@ cally it must create in@@ eff@@ ort@@ less@@ ness . even under optimal conditions , it can never be the effect of ac@@ ute filters . practical is the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least as well as the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask . FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better at the processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small run @-@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image must be correc@@ ted . this image has been taken with an analog@@ ous camera . this image has been taken on in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods for sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator is set up the shar@@ ply of the single point to generate a natural p@@ up@@ id in order to produce a natural p@@ up@@ id .
the color tin@@ ted enables a adapted color for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want to do blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove the desired Ar@@ te@@ facts with un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented speed .
the algorith@@ m was developed by the IMAGE Team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains several pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simp@@ lif@@ y the restoration . the available default settings are below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail View p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preserv@@ ation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass . a value of 0.9 should be higher , that no sharp@@ ening should be subsequently required . please note that the detailed report should always be requested .
the alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value of smo@@ oth@@ ly even@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts will be one of the best value in the vicinity of 1 .
smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smo@@ othing factor via all@@ es@@ . p defines the relative smo@@ othing . put this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ ar@@ ity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameters for greater structures . if higher this value is set , the more will be smo@@ oth@@ ed . this is difficult to appreci@@ ate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; tur@@ bul@@ l@@ ature effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
rep@@ et@@ itions : indicates how often the algorith@@ m is running out . usually 1 or 2 is gone .
angular blades da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen , you should also create small angle for a long term . you should choose this value so much possible and for your needs acceptable .
integr@@ ity st@@ ems distance &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ity st@@ ems in pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : this option can only be low due to quality of this option is only minimal . he doubled the term . we recommend him to leave it .
the buttons stor@@ ing as and shop do exactly this . each setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and can be re@@ loaded later .
image errors fixed is compar@@ atively very fast at work . it can still take a very long and a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the push button .
below , you can see how image errors can be correc@@ ted with a photo@@ graphic camera . as you can see it is an in@@ expensive black ar@@ te@@ facts in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film in the journey . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; smoking is a very powerful tool to decrease Bil@@ dr@@ au@@ schen . it uses a ur@@ he@@ ber@@ leg@@ ally protected Alg@@ orith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other Ar@@ te@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair to the lens , can be used to remove Sensor@@ less of the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ ac@@ ute ; -@@ Eff@@ ects of collected images from books or magazines .
if you require further information about sensors of digital cameras , you can read this tut@@ orial in this tut@@ orial .
the screenshot of the image shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ dient noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following cases you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the window details and the window advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filters . large values increase the filter per pixel . by the radius changed over the picture and the color in it is smo@@ oth@@ ed and that smaller bug fixes .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . if it be increased , smoking changes will be deleted . if the value is too high , if you can change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can not get more and noise or dirt .
Kan@@ ters : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value increases the frequency response of the filtr@@ ation . if it is too strong , can &apos;t occur the entire noise . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ e@@ facts .
light density : controls the illumin@@ ance cur@@ ves of the picture . we recommend to improve your image or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings will not affect the smo@@ othing process due to the details settings .
Color : controls the color tolerance of the picture . we recommend to improve your image or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings will not affect the smo@@ othing process due to the details settings .
gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark areas , which typically are stronger , however , it is poll@@ uted .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the align@@ ment of Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ atten@@ u@@ ation . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the ligh@@ tening . if it is too high , the edges can occur . it can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter to edges . it can remove noise levels and is the recommended method for this .
save and store : these buttons are exactly used . all parameters to be set , which you can have set , can be stored in the file system and later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted with the default settings .
sometimes a painting is cr@@ acked for your purpose . the solution , image a bit soft , is fortunately much easier than a painting with the menu entry , and experim@@ ent with the gl@@ uten . the fe@@ eder opening on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to decrease photo archive .
these filters for the restoration gives you the possibility of un@@ wanted art@@ e@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to the Gau@@ ß &apos; cher@@ ries , film pieces , cr@@ at@@ zer , com@@ pres@@ sive images and ren@@ der out the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and ly@@ rical resources . the algorith@@ m is developed with another tool that is developed by the IMAGE Team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a lost instrument of compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this attitude is to correc@@ ted this problems .
the buttons stor@@ ing as and shop do exactly this . any setting of photo Rest@@ oration can be stored in a text file and can be re@@ loaded later .
photo Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . it can still take a very long and a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below , the module can be used as a photo with equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ ori@@ ous pieces of films on the face . the original image is below ( 1 ) and correct ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example for the photo Rest@@ oration . this time , tex@@ tures can be read on an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; Tool@@ bar is allowed to remove Hot@@ pixel by photos that were able to remove a CCD camera with a CCD camera . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression is equipped with a built @-@ in suppression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ trac@@ tive method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
Download this file in the assist@@ ants with the button Dark . the tool will recogn@@ ise automatically the hot and bright pixels . these are lifted up in picture show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark pattern directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels from CCD .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct image . please note that the assistant will attend the last dark image , and this will be automatically re@@ fresh in the next meeting .
the image area and the preview help you into the image of the result . the fe@@ eds shows the output of the felt with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted up in all the advantages .
in order to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filters . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pixel blocks . this are the available filter :
thir@@ sty section : this is an average of the neigh@@ bour @-@ pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all Pix@@ ies that have a distance of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixel in blo@@ c .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ing method . all pixel pitch is used to calculate a bi @-@ square surfaces ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in blo@@ c .
Kub@@ isch : every pixel with a distance of 3 or less are pul@@ led to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ical surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an Cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixel in blo@@ c .
below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long im@@ aging , applied . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the dig@@ ik@@ am ; Vign@@ et@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ ting , i.e. under@@ lined corners , one image of the picture .
wide angle lens , especially in the medium sized and large photo format , frequently the entire sensor area cannot be even@@ ly illumin@@ ated . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they can reduce the light to the sensor . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses are also reflected in circumstances .
but also dis@@ advantages . many Center filter require a factor of 1.5 or 2 while the Bl@@ ender filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also use with Center filter , a hole of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise free effects of movement arise .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter , which is used without these filters . the tool has been used without these filters . the tool has been protected by a Center@@ filter on an image . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the Vign@@ et@@ ting @-@ correct Cor@@ rection Filter and with three further the exposure of the target bil@@ ateral .
density : this parameter controls the highest density at the highest density . the standard density is 2.0 , which is due to a optical filter of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , designed to compens@@ ate the density by a greater degree of Vign@@ et@@ ting to compens@@ ate it by a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ thickness , Contr@@ ast and gamma settings : the edit of a picture with the Vign@@ et@@ ting correction is decre@@ asing the illumin@@ ated thickness of the pixels . you must represent the exposure of target with these options only positive values , as you need to increase the settings .
if you want a more sensitive rest@@ oring of the target image , then let the values for illumin@@ ance / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the Grad@@ ation from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing from the menu color Grad@@ ation .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ting correction is applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the illustration of the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ ted image has also been carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; lens dist@@ or@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a ur@@ he@@ ber@@ leg@@ ally protected Alg@@ orith@@ m by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion . colour dist@@ or@@ tions can not be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the co@@ effici@@ ents of the second degree is treated with the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion of lens and may be correc@@ ted the conc@@ ave or conv@@ ex shape of the picture .
the co@@ effici@@ ents of the third degree has a similar circular impact , but it is applied to the edges . these correction is not used in the tool .
the co@@ effici@@ ents tr@@ ades correc@@ ted the dist@@ ant corners opposite the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion can be elim@@ inated .
General : this value controls the strength of dist@@ or@@ tion second degree . with negative values , t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical dist@@ or@@ tions can be correc@@ ted and positive values of the dist@@ ress dist@@ or@@ tion .
corner : this value is controlled the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion fourth degree . this value is stronger than in the centre of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners have the link sign of the parameter &apos; parameter .
Zoom : this value is scal@@ able the picture size and leads to a correction for the first degree . negative values en@@ large while positive the image .
ref@@ use : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the picture of the picture in the corners , while positive values they increase .
in order to help you the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview of dist@@ or@@ tion structure . the values apply for your image , are stored and when the next start is used as default values .
the t@@ onn@@ en- or cold @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all the cutting edges or size changes . the best result will perform these correction than all the first through . if you have an image to cut and afterwards an t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction should be correc@@ ted the effect of the Fal@@ se .
to help you the best correction to show you this tool a vertical and a horizontal support line . move it to a key location , like e.g. the se@@ wing of the edge or a building wall to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can correc@@ ted the t@@ onn@@ en- / c@@ act@@ ress dist@@ or@@ tion using the help of the lines .
if you correc@@ ted the resulting image , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu , cutting the image processing or via the zoom knob of this di@@ alog@@ s .
for most images the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction came from the next logical step for some mot@@ ifs like e.g. photos from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective into a picture 90 degrees . NOTE that if you keep the camera with the hand , you always have a slight dist@@ or@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example for the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method for sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website under this UR@@ L . filter re@@ produced the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this UR@@ L . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to sim@@ ulate a highly sensitive film sequence . the ISO regulator is changing the amount of film pieces and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ oph@@ yl@@ l in nature ) in the conversion . green me@@ adows are white as snow !
because the filter channels can be mixed to produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the Far@@ bin@@ form@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of infrared fil@@ ies applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the image of the film was set on ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type A@@ ura in the nickname .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ am ; filter film gritt is a simple tool to produce films to your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed filters , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tri @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer great silver gra@@ ins of the photo@@ emul@@ sion .
the film cor@@ ruption gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move into the past life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ arti@@ gen , road photo@@ graphic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you need to use this filter .
with the control , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the body , though frequently higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , so you can turn the filter several times .
this is an example of film management efficiency on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an impressive protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; filter oil paintings are your digital images like a nice look like a oil painting . nature images and stylish are good for this effect .
there are two reg@@ ler to influence this effect . the upper part cho@@ oses the pin@@ out size between one and five . thick brush are better for great pictures . smo@@ othing the gl@@ uten , or out of the other side , the char@@ ity is considered .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this is marked with ( 2 ) . pin@@ out size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; filter coal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dient to create a Kohl@@ esk@@ iz@@ ze . they are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine , which scene must have selected yourself to sk@@ iz@@ z@@ ze . this would have been good pictures to start it .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator is cho@@ oses the pin size and the bottom adjustable the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of coal direc@@ tories . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adap@@ ting the intensity .
the dig@@ ik@@ am ; filter engraving the picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was marked in wax . it uses a pro@@ sec@@ tional algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important at the contents . filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to trans@@ form the image in a gray , mon@@ tory landscape .
the depth allowed it to set the contrast of filters . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example for the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an art of dist@@ or@@ tion effects . it uses ur@@ he@@ ber@@ leg@@ ally protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
oil blocks 1 : share the picture in cells and can look like it is considered whether it is turned through glass blocks .
oil blocks 2 : analogue to the wav@@ y blocks 1 is dist@@ orted the picture here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculation and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the knob .
with this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an art @-@ visual effects . it uses ur@@ he@@ ber@@ leg@@ ally protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom concl@@ usions : the image along the ular lines run out of a centre . this is sim@@ ulates a zoom @-@ up camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ als un@@ sharp@@ ness : im@@ pregn@@ ated the image by rotation of the pixel . this is sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a turning camera .
distances : im@@ pregn@@ ated the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears in the background .
motion @-@ shar@@ ply : the image by horizontal movements of pi@@ x . this is sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : b : from a car or train photographs , camera .
soft ton@@ ight : im@@ pregn@@ ated the picture in the dark and strong in bright tones . this is ideal for creating a romantic port@@ raits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add to add a warm and sub@@ tle inc@@ and@@ escent lamps .
bulk soli@@ ds : im@@ pregn@@ ated the image by random shi@@ fting of pixel and sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a very ar@@ bit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
smart un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the bul@@ l@@ bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ ped them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and created , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculation and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the reg@@ ard@@ rop are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ard@@ rop on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a great look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ he@@ ber@@ leg@@ ally protected Alg@@ orith@@ m .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the box . since the dri@@ p size isn &apos;t necessary to reduce the size of small pictures , the number and density of drops . Fisch@@ au@@ gen changes the optical effect on the picture .
you can keep using &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing a range free of reg@@ ard@@ rop . use the range of tool to re@@ alize the area , e.g. a vision that will remain free to stay . if you don &apos;t start the Filter Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps , the range will remain free of reg@@ ard@@ rop .
this is an example of the reg@@ ard@@ rop Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and modified image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values used for this example .
if the picture depic@@ ts the wrong orientation , you can bring it through sp@@ ans or thre@@ ats to the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu of trans@@ forming or trans@@ forms .
photo blow is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to have a photo en@@ large loss of image quality .
a painting is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture , if the bound@@ aries of the resolution is achieved ? how can I find the missing information or err@@ ata ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m is used here , making it a good job . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size and choose to change the target values in menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool used to change the system used a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to adjust the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow injection .
many educational programs are using a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to en@@ large one image . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; used a further developed approach . the extension of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France has been developed and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider Neue size and are listed below :
aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the current size will keep the original size of the original image .
regul@@ ar@@ ity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameters for greater structures . if higher this value is set , the more will be smo@@ oth@@ ed . this is difficult to appreci@@ ate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons stor@@ ing as and shop will be exactly used . each single phase for photo en@@ large can be stored as text file and later on .
photo blow is very fast when it makes it , but it can still take a very long and a high CPU load . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example for photo blow by using a small color display . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlar@@ ged picture ( 3 ) and the enlar@@ ged picture ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlar@@ gement .
the cutting of a photos is not just a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture with the mouse , simply create the mouse with the mouse , through press the mouse button and move the rectangle with mouse , then you &apos;ll move the mouse while you move the mouse .
if you leave the mouse button , the field of photos will be cut off . therefore , you can change the size of the right after cutting @-@ to @-@ cutting area by using the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting machine , use the button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file memory or file memory under the menu file to store the newly designed photo .
in the presentation area , you can change the size of the rectangle with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains .
in addition to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in the large format , the larger value of the height and in the horizontal format of the width can be assigned .
the tool after side ratio is used a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal to whether you are centi@@ meters , inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to reach the selection , horizontal or vertical .
below in the dialog you can set with the Max . base knob in the range for cutting , depending on the maximum ratio and orientation , set .
the tool after side ratio add its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or Vertical ) . if you are stored in the image values , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are attributed to the picture and not the original image .
the settings of the assem@@ bling systems allow help to help you in order to put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ ar@@ ity . like the third one , harmon@@ ious triangles is an opportunity to divide a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ious triangles .
Golden Middle : the golden center is a division established on various natural growth sm@@ ells , such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blast@@ ing leaves of a sun@@ flower . it is possible in all possible things that we see as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 988 ... and it was used already in the ancient Egypti@@ ans and Gre@@ eks who used your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden split in all times when you have used your images , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is located from the Fibonacci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number is equal to 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that rule is followed as a visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden centre provides liquid support lines if you are set up in picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will make your target good results for your photos . compared to the third level , the Golden spiral line will follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and exhau@@ sted on this kind of sym@@ metric visual river .
another rule is called the corner of the golden spiral , also called golden spiral . it should be something to create the eye of the composition . this can only be one line or different objects . this somewhat can be just as without the eye , it will carry out his task .
the gold triangles lead also from the above golden spiral . their failure are the middle @-@ points of the golden frame . NOTE that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , the triangles is no equ@@ alled triangles . Diag@@ onal at this lines can be able to pl@@ az@@ ze an static object .
if you need golden triangles using your frames , create a effect of professional Photo@@ graph@@ s dynamic sym@@ metry : try your image capture and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition which can not reach you .
the options Horizontal and Vertical sp@@ ans can be used to split the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the colour of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colours and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this kind you can adjust the colour of the lines your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to turn an image around any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera . this creates a picture , in which the things are turned around an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . choose the trans@@ form free rotation and just@@ ify the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the door , you can reset the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window .
for your help , the module free rotation is a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in picture show around the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now Adjust@@ ing the angle as in the previous section .
after you have shot an image , you will find an un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is the function trans@@ form to use the image processing .
a elegant way to add the image , is the feature automatic cutting . choose one of the following options :
an option Anti @-@ ali@@ asing smo@@ oth@@ ed the image a bit after turning . keep the above war@@ nings .
all per@@ formers are carried out by a fixation of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the centre of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to change the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right side of the dialogue , you will find some information that help you help the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas formed by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas formed by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the trans@@ form@@ ulated area .
at the right : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the trans@@ form@@ ulated area .
right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ form@@ ulated area .
right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ form@@ ulated area .
after adap@@ ting the perspective the image is a bit dir@@ ty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small but two adjust@@ ments provide a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you will receive un@@ pleas@@ ing tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one ability to make it a picture with transformation , cutting the picture processing .
the mold tool is used to shift one part of the picture in one direction to move the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not dist@@ or@@ ated into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformation sc@@ iss@@ ors .
sc@@ iss@@ ing your image by using the horizontal angles and vertical angle . if you can press at default , the angle will look back to zero . a preview of effect will be displayed on you and the new dimensions of target image will be displayed on the right .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line ends . move the mouse to a key point , like e.g. the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the spreader tool to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the image , the image is a bit ver@@ itable . for a single note , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble , but two deposits generated twice as much conf@@ isc@@ ence and therefore you should avoid this .
after the re@@ frac@@ tory , the picture has an un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to elim@@ inate this is the picture with transformation , cutting the picture processing .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; requires a number of libr@@ aries and other packages to read image formats , therefore , in some cases , of the type such as these libr@@ aries have been comp@@ il@@ uted . in most distri@@ bu@@ cks you will be able to work a large number of image formats with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
due to this depend@@ ency of other libr@@ aries , it is impossible to give it a list of all available file formats . but you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; displays only files in formats . if the extension is listed in the list . if the extension in the list is listed , &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; file extensions can be displayed in the picture processing . you can change this list of file extensions on &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; do not accept any further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos stored in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to use a detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression method on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information reduces the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , sh@@ atter@@ s results as JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save a loss free when this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the resource image format , you can read more than Wikipedia , The Lumin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw Image Converter of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports the store of crude images only with the dc@@ raw , which is contained in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; included here you can see below on the web page from Dave Coff@@ in . see table below shows a short list of commod@@ ities from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . and dig@@ ik@@ am . however , it is not a film file program . if you click on a film file &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use the program to play back to playback .
forward forward to the previously visited album in Chron@@ icle . you may only go forward when you go before .

all con@@ figure cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera to add a new camera to add a new camera . please look for further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module also exported a series of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth and displayed with Google Earth .
if you make the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good if the initial contrast was very good , you can perform the first four ju@@ ices with the White module .
many tools you need the photo processing are in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; contain their description as follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , plast@@ ering , noise reduction , re@@ focus , etc . do not use a uniform dialog box before the filter is applied to the current image . below see &amp; quot ; tex@@ ture App@@ lic@@ ated quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . links from him allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ative mode of the previous year . these modes are :
vertical parts without du@@ pe . the left below shows the original and the right shows the filter used on the right of the selected division .
horizontal parts without Dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and lower deck shows the filter used on the range below the selected division .
vertical parts . the left below shows the original and the right to the effect of the film .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and lower to the effect of the filters .
&apos;@@ mouse via &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the front and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons on the switch to show over@@ weight and sub@@ im@@ aging . the used colors can be adapted to the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the framework for the preview of preview . you can see this frame with the mouse within the picture and on the part of the picture , you will see the preview of the link part of the dialogue is now updated .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset them all buttons on your default values .
the tool@@ bar characteristics shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely declared itself . it is listed in the following sections :
Foto@@ characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters at the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data if this is available .
this rider provides an intuitive card set based on the Marble mini@@ ature range . you can move up to Ctr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull down the left mouse button . all pictures within this co @-@ ordin@@ ates are filtered and displayed . this is the course to contain the pictures Geo @-@ data .

further required software : &amp; k@@ graph @-@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that is the &amp; graphic tool ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph is required . required in detail :
the main window shows the open@@ able graphic , each in its own window . in this case , the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Last updated files . click on the first icon to show the dialog .
after you have chosen a or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , a glance in the corner is indicated if the graph is larger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this review or select that position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special fast@@ ing , left and right when pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . see the maximum reduction of a grap@@ es@@ .
if the straight in &amp; graphic viewer ; invited file from another program is modified , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ign@@ ore the change . &amp; c@@ graphic viewer ; can you want to change your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can also use the menu point of settings ; see also .
if you are open a Graph@@ file outside of a running &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ Inst@@ ance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; c@@ graphic viewer ; -@@ Inst@@ ance or to inv@@ ent graphics in a window of the current inst@@ ances .
as at the last option you can save your choice , but these also can change with the align@@ ment dialog .
while the program start , you can open all the graph of your last session . again , you can change your choice as well as later .
you can also set as the graph on several sites , the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected .
if you are using several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphic that will be entered into this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the grap@@ ef@@ ish .
page show with one on several pages distributed graphics without head@@ line and with another font
the page again store the possibility to determine the behavior , if a file on the hard disk is modified , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can establish a default behavior ( automatically re@@ loading or changes every time ) or the program every time .
the page open the ability to set the behaviour of &amp; graph @-@ viewer ; if a graph is open outside a current session . you can open a standard behaviour for this case ( push in a new window , or in a window of the current session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the page stages are the possibility to determine the start @-@ behavior of &amp; c@@ graph@@ ical ; determine the default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine , when you need to be asked .
the text menu , usually with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opened further opportunities :

select Transparent pixel or lens display and make colour display : or a chess board as transpar@@ ency display . you can also set the size : the Kar@@ os on Small , Medium and Big 1 : and Color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module makes tools to read tools to read new images , and these can be added .
this module can be used to produce new pictures only for external sources of external sources and can be used . currently two sources can be used :
pictures scan : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images of a scanner which supported by the s@@ ane project or another source such as video streams . so this works K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane .
if you choose the menu entry images , a dialog appears to select between all the sources on your machine . choose the source of you can get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace your image by default . you can see the preview of and adjust the field to your needs . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
NOTE that the window is completely visible , because some settings are otherwise indicated .
after you have completed the button Sc@@ anning , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the type of image file . do you think that the type BMP cannot be compressed and therefore very large files . you must also select the folders &amp; # 160 ; select whether the image must be stored .

with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can convert your in RAW format stored in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool dc@@ raw from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect the same results as the software from your camera distribution . sometimes you get the dc@@ raw quality ! .
first , choose the RAW file , and start the module . the raw image conver@@ ters window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button you can look at the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now re@@ define the values to optimi@@ ze the camera settings , if the camera settings can be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue amplif@@ iers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue working on the picture later .
a four @-@ colour RG@@ BG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera is in RGB mode , the RG@@ BG switch doesn &apos;t work effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview can choose one of the three output formats , and the fil@@ ename will be equal and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a lost algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged Image format , TIFF , maint@@ ains all information of your image and uses the loss free L@@ ZW compression .
if you want to use your pictures often , or later you should use the JPEG format , since it is just a limited number of operations before the image quality is det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as memory format , met@@ ad@@ ata can be stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file into the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start button to start button . if you want to break down this process , you can break it off .
the st@@ acking processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to one time . use this mode therefore , e.g. through testing on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual pictures . however , this is helpful if these in an earlier experim@@ ent . a preview of this is not available in an earlier experim@@ ent . a preview can &apos;t be available at how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to convert all images in a record . it uses the program Convert from the Im@@ age@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame the pictures of an Alb@@ ums . you can reset the pre@@ fix , starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the tim@@ est@@ amp .
this module can be used to change the size of several pictures of a photo collection . it uses the Convert program from the Im@@ age@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can now put the image of smaller or en@@ large . these are four types of picture changes available :
propor@@ tional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . if you remain unchanged , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen .
non propor@@ tional : not propor@@ tional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
the printing preparation : prepare the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the printing Resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , includes background size , edge size and background colour is accordingly adjusted .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of additional images before . more pictures can pull out on the list of the sent images and place there .
after you start the module , the pictures are now displayed with your chosen images . via the button pictures you can add more images . for the latest image , a preview can be displayed on the right side .
you can also go pictures on the picture list and add there to add a list of the list of adding images .
using the button images , select the selected pictures from the list of the sent pictures .
after you have selected all images , you can open the new message window window of your e @-@ mail clients . you need to add here the addresses and the subject . they are already inserted as an app@@ endix .
do not look for many pictures on once to ship . most E @-@ mail accounts have to send restri@@ ctions for the size of the sent e @-@ ma@@ ils . it may be a good idea to send multiple em@@ ails , if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for the end of the pictures . their configuration is stored and stored again until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download these here .
after the selection of comments in a specified file , the comments given to the images in a text file and put the mail .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the lost formats such as TIFF . you should not use PNG if you should not be changed , otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG using images file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original @-@ Ex@@ if@@ ications are added to the sent images .
if the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down to errors that you can watch the status of errors that you can start automatically at the end . with the door knob , you can lie down this window ?

the Open@@ GL transfers into the presentation uses very elegant image Trans@@ itions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have an appropriate graphic card because otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au is very slowly .
the option fil@@ ename ensures that the file &apos;s fil@@ ename is displayed in the left lower corner , while the presentation will be displayed .
the option loop ensures that the presentation in an En@@ dless loop is displayed . you can break the manual with Es@@ c ; ab@@ om@@ iting .
the option added pictures ensures that the pictures in random order will be displayed in a random order . it is not the order of the images in the album .
delay between the images can set the tempor@@ al distance between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspon@@ d to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen trans@@ itional effect . you should be the first to show your friends !
there are more than a do@@ zen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . random with any transition between the images another effect .
while the Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool bar at the top left edge of the edge . move the mouse to this corner by you .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start to the previous and stop the next picture and stop the fas@@ c@@ au .
on the left lower screen edge , you can see the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module &apos;s time &amp; date does not have any documentation . if you are interested in this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ Im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ org@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English .

&amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your pictures , integrated and the other as module ( see ) . in the following part of user hand@@ book is described in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create about the menu file HTML ...
before HTML pages , you have to take some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and goal . in the following , each section is described .
first , enter the title of over@@ looked and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example for this settings .
next , you will select whether a &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file will be created on the review page . Read more about export files you will find in .
recently , you can select information on the HTML page . therefore , you can notice that all pictures of a party are ob@@ vious . for example , all pictures are exported . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from particular subject to certain photos .
in this area you can define , as the HTML pages will look like . most of the settings are clearly , why not this is not specially developed .
below , you can adjust different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who want to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures can download the resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 resolution .
the viewer on your site can change the resolution at any time . it can indicate your images with low resolution , as well as if a picture is larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , setting the different folders and UR@@ L where your website is stored .
best select all your HTML files for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent pro@@ position a new sub@@ file .
first you need to select the main folder , in which all your pictures are stored . this file is stored and when you select the coming pictures of the storage space . here you can choose either a folder or one from K@@ DE supporting protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check this really all for viewer . if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , the UR@@ L you should start here . otherwise , the web browser does not launch in the wrong folder .
if you are not able to copy it in the final target file , you need to specify it to the final target file . this is not the final target of files . this is not the sub@@ file of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub @-@ folders are .
this is the just described setup possibilities for all three in basic folder , or UR@@ L@@ s . in these , a sub @-@ folders , whose name is set to set it in output file .
if you are interested in a family celebration , a meeting or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; you can try to create a HTML page for viewing pictures , but if you add a lot of time , you need to add up and photo@@ photo@@ album , then you need to do with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even doing once again .
with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures in a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import a copy of your database with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they di@@ ffer in this file or if the pictures can be stored in the file , if you have all pictures together , and this file can be stored on the file , however , the file size is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im -@@ file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures that are located in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if you are not found in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export file .
in the following , the dialog for export of pictures , which you can export over the menu file .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is an internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three options available :
if you can copy a manual near the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
this option is cop@@ ied into the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically gives you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file is very small , but if you want to add it , then select the option rating file compressed .
the last option of this page is the maximum image size limits . if you send the pictures maybe not in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can say that each picture can be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file , select &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; the exp@@ orting database as described in described .
the assistant to the imp@@ orter consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures can be imported , then in which file the import should be cop@@ ied .
it can be that you can be imported the category of people to imp@@ or@@ ating file ( if you have a Dane ) , while this category can be imported into the third time window , which should be imported from the categories of imported file in your database .
in the fourth step , you can set the categories from the file of your current database with the categories of your current database . an example here is shown on the picture .
it must be just to brow@@ se pictures and look at : if you want pictures , you would like to watch pictures of your Italy vacation &amp; md@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your bo@@ y@@ friend , you might want to see all the images that this friend is depic@@ ted .

&amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; attend the folders , in which your pictures are stored again . if you wish to start another database in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , so you can start a different folder with images , you can start &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / in@@ dex@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry of photo@@ photo@@ album ; let you go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; change the following section of user account will be explained in the following section of user manual .
at the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call the preview of preview and options for the viewer . for any setting there is an exhau@@ st@@ ive help you can call for a button on the F1 button and click on the desired option .
in it has been described as you can create different features for each image , e.g. persons , places and Tags : you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
check the dialog , which is used to do already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a lab@@ elling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories , sub@@ divisions were already mentioned . in dialogue , you can create full membership groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medium car@@ ds as stated .
in view the setup possibilities , you can select the list of the membership groups . with the above @-@ listed selection list , you can choose the category of your choice . in the left window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of the sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; share the module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . nour@@ ishing information please refer to the homepage of K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called upon the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; are they are not sold separately . most modules have one help , but you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules can be used together for several applications , it may be able to test these modules with the demo database , before you can call this new modules first with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu . do not say , I &apos;d have not war@@ ned !
the applications that the modules are connected via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so that some modules can work with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage , if you divide functions with different applications .
the greatest difference between &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications which are also using K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simple . also if &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order to albums , so you can use the features &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album .
this is sim@@ ulated &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that is just equal to the current view , so that all images showing you the picture of the picture shows .
in addition to the current album , &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also delivered a list of albums . here is &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
when &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; s brow@@ s@@ ers the contents of a category shows , for example , each of this category is an album for the module .
or it will have the category that you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , for example , if you use the category people , it will be selected &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; so if you have selected persons to view and the module would be further improved .
since some modules with &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; not compatible , you can remove these from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select in the modules , which modules are charged .
on the picture you can see an example for a starting screen , once you start &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures .
as you can find out of any other K@@ DE application , see above a menu and a tool bar . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window , where you don &apos;t have any information about your pictures , but now click on this window , now click here to show a glance with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with remarks , where the image has been taken either single or for a higher number of pictures simultaneously . if the picture is depic@@ ted on all images Jes@@ per and all pictures were included in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for the search and brow@@ ses as you can see in section . if you want to see these notes , if you want to use the integrated viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by using people , locations and key@@ pass@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; because you can always use information about your pictures .
the following idea is the translation of the pictures within the list : if you are depic@@ ted a family celebration and on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can see that the names are shi@@ fted up@@ ward , those who can find faster and arrange them .
if you prefer a Alphabetical product list , click on the symbol for sorting to date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you would like to work all the selected pictures and this pictures with notes . click on the front and back buttons that are under the preview of the picture at the top .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable all these pictures to mark and add the menu item more than once with an note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as over@@ group . to indicate that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol will appear .
in the context of the edit@@ orial notes of the remarks , it is possible to add one entry to a complete or sub@@ category or sub@@ category . NOTE that you can see this to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this is pre@@ dict that you &apos;re right in alphabet@@ ical order . see this .
you can shift the individual elements of the remarks , by cli@@ cking the edge , which form the upper part of the frame , click and move up from a frame , by using it outside the window mode .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , you can find with the settings , click on the button Op@@ tions ... , which offers you the option to store the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also make a frame completely hi@@ ding . if you want to see this window , use the button options ... and then window will open a / f@@ ading . this procedure will see you in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview of presentations of selected pictures , or of all pictures you can see here . you can see the size of the presentation , by simple to bottom of the mouse with the medium mouse button , con@@ figure . try it simply times .
when you make a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background picture for your desktop .
if you click on an image , this is displayed in picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can delete pictures from the picture show you can delete pictures from that you want to delete the corresponding pictures or select either the remov@@ ing button or select either the menu button . now , you will see the window , which you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; it can also be stored for this problem . you can also be stored on the hard drive . of course you have to store pictures anywhere you can be stored in the database Index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures of the hard drive can be loaded .
pictures , where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . this is illustrated by the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , you can display the preview of this pictures , however , you can &apos;t display these pictures with the image capture .
as you see this function you will find files from the folders and again put forward . &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; if you would not want to avoid the inser@@ tion of your pictures please , please buy a larger disk to save all pictures on it .
in the menu pictures you can find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to make a little more privacy , you can easily make the images that you can see for others and click on current view into the menu . alternatively , you can also see all images that you can easily pick up your little sister except for the current view .
so , you have set the images in the case of the F@@ alles . if you have locked out the menu entry images , you can simply choose the menu entry images , which you have block@@ ed , bl@@ ind@@ ed . if you want to appear once again , click the back on sper@@ m .
it is also possible to set a password , which must be entered into the images . to set this password , select password change in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture is very safe . if you can find all pictures on the hard disk and the other , each of which can read on the file in@@ dex@@ .x@@ ml , the password can only read it , those who are using &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar , look at private images .
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; lasting and hours over hours that you want to look at any time . from this reason , &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . this can be seen from the preview , as described in writing .
the viewer can be seen in view . it shows the picture , but additional information that you have to enter the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if you want to see the Info@@ box in the upper part of the image that you can easily pull and what else can be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . then you can see the text @-@ text menu and you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are subject . if you click here the browser , see , right entries to this show . if you click on Anne Helene . as if you have selected pictures from the browser and then Anne Helene selected .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can use the keys for the first and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the text menu .
if multiple pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as a dip album . as frequently it can be a new picture . as frequently it can press the Ctr@@ l button and Plus Min@@ us , the di@@ ash@@ au is launched by the buttons Ctr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the au@@ ster@@ ity of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; can be used in full image mode . use the viewer button on the screen . do just use the input button to change full @-@ mode and back .
if you can use the viewer in the image , you can easily move a rectangle with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us key , the Plus button lets you drawn up again in the centre of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the Zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ om@@ ed . with the equ@@ ation of the Zo@@ oms , so that each pixel comp@@ lies on the screen a pixel screen .
NOTE that the only Zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations will work at videos that are coming and zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and min@@ t key .
with the script functions from the text @-@ menu , you can turn the image . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can also make notes to the current picture with the menu notes from the text menu .
if you look at pictures you can find a picture with one person whose name you will have to put on the picture . in the moment you can add and configuration dialog box . however , you will perhaps be careful to mark the image and look more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to get a printer to watch the images on paper . to see what photos you can start the viewer with the pictures and they would mark it as good or bad , while they see one after the other .
for the two examples above gives you the possibility of features with features , while you see them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can reset the appropriate letters . see a picture where characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , you can see all pictures you want to work , print or whatever you &apos;ve always selected , so you can use any module to copy the selected images to copy a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially characteristics can be displayed in the front view . if you can add photos in the view view , then you can press features the letters for the views , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
this painted is not stored with the image but in the database . on the way you can easily make your painted later .
you can see a picture on the painted . to finish the painting mode from the painting menu . to finish the image paint on the painting menu . to end the image , you simply impressions the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you have to rule the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely rule , but documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should have read necess@@ arily and understood .
in the object tree you can select some objects . then the properties found in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire @-@ modular views yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected lenses , as all sub@@ objects already selected by the object .
to add a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object or select either on the icon or select an menu entry in the menu .
there are multi@@ ply positions , the following fol@@ dable menu is bl@@ ind@@ ed , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ et@@ ion either from the menu bar below ground or from the original mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click navig@@ ate to apply these changes . if you have in@@ valid values , a message with an error code , then you can click to en@@ abling the input or changes with ab@@ om@@ iting .
if you enter the path to enter the P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the shown object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation contains not in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
if you work a tex@@ ture or part of a tex@@ ture , you can see a preview of view @-@ in view .
press on preview in the property view and a small example of the scene will be controlled with the selected tex@@ ture . if you want to choose an order element in tex@@ ture ( for example , a tex@@ ture within a tex@@ ture Map and not the entire tex@@ ture Map ) , cross loc@@ ally loc@@ ally .
image photo shows the control points of the camera . you can pull this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross is marked the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by pul@@ ling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a view@@ able level model . you can specify this value relative to the visible lens or as absolute value . objects are only displayed , if they are selected or their vis@@ ibility level , or equal to the scene of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window orders as default . the object tree and view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graph@@ ical views right .
if you don &apos;t like to know the default window orders or if you need another arrangement , you can also save any other window orders and change between various arran@@ gem@@ ents .
to t@@ ank@@ ed a window over or under one present view , draw the author for the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , draw the author for the right or left side of a view . the new view is t@@ ank@@ ed on the right or left side of this list and extends over the entire height .
if you want to change several views over one another , draw the author in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views through cli@@ cking on the map sheet in the views .
the last possible window sub@@ ordin@@ ates are floating views : views , which are not in the main window . to solve one view from the anch@@ oring , draw the pin to the desktop or click on the small following to the left above the visible arrow in the editor bar .
to close a view , click the little cross in the pre@@ y bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views on the main window . in the menu view find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can ver@@ ify it at any spot .
the current window view can store you with view window order ... save a dialog , where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have a scene , you can ren@@ der it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g for ren@@ dering , this program needs to be installed . as this manual was written , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click the symbol ren@@ dering the symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view .
a ren@@ der @-@ mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determin@@ es the image size and quality of ren@@ ders . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert many Ren@@ der modes , from a fast preview up to full screen in the highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The Ren@@ der Settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View , select the following dialog :
each ren@@ der @-@ mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the card size , you can define the width and height of the ren@@ dered picture . if you want only a small area of the image , select the check section and give the picture section to the ren@@ dering form .
in combination of quality you can select the properties that used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lights . an exhau@@ st@@ ive description of ren@@ der properties can be found in user &apos;s guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray .
if a picture with only a beam of each pi@@ x is done , there are often different errors . these pictures have often displayed a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or st@@ epp@@ ing effects in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes you will not appear when it is smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this mistake . generally , pictures with this feature is better .
if you enter Anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects to P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technology is great sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the second method is adap@@ tive to recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is always divided and adapted for the calculated color values by the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray is followed by the default value of pixels , then both pixels are calculated using the per@@ secution of a specific number of pixels with super sampling . if you add the depth of 4x4 additional points , a grid value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) add additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference is divided between the color values , then the pixels will be checked in 4 sub @-@ pixel and can be checked out on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recru@@ it@@ sion can be adjusted by the depth .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you can change J@@ itter@@ ing , changing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples .
the final setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use lighting re@@ flex@@ ion . it takes a very long to charge a scene with this feature .
in this cardboard box you can adjust whether the alpha channels can be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pi@@ x is then transparent when the associated sh@@ ays have no object .
opens a new window for the display of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expected , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene file , select the menu entry file ... and choose the dialog window a file .
currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is currently supported &amp; p@@ ov@@ ray ; yet with the full command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when imp@@ acted error reports or war@@ nings , shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support sources in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ ac@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to export the source code in the editor file . to edit objects into the scene file , marking the source code in the editor and move it into the object tree .
with copy and Insert in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your Editor , you can also add sources for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called , when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene is sign@@ posted . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help of the property , opens &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the shown object . put here the path to your documents and version . supports versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; seek to external files ( for example al@@ location data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libr@@ aries . if you refer to files that are not in the file of the scene , you must also use the path to these files . if a file in different paths of the library is used , the first @-@ folded file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle in the camera view and in the window type features .
you can adjust the objects of the points to the grid @-@ text menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the ra@@ ster set separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and turns .
bigger values produce a precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for products , require more time to ren@@ der . for some objects , such as ball can set the detailed stage for two directions .
if you have more detailed proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , all the camera uses an advanced projection screen . it gives a better approach for proj@@ ections but requires more time to ren@@ der .
when you cross a wall , one wall mounted behind objects . the wall is depic@@ ted in a chess pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the floor , a bottom is located below the objects . the floor is depic@@ ted in a chess pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you cross the edge of hot smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive non @-@ recur@@ sive non @-@ term method for the ren@@ dering of the scenes , you can adjust the values for depth and threshold . Read more to the parameters in section Ren@@ der @-@ Mod@@ i .
on this page you can change the window manufacturers or create new window orders . in the section of window orders , as you can create window manufacturers and store .
the combination of default window manufacturers : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the chosen window regulation at the start of the program .
the list of pre @-@ hand@@ hel@@ ds will show all existing window manufacturers . a new arrangement can be extrac@@ ting with the button , and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below names shows all the views of the chosen window order . new views can set you with the door adding and selected views with the door knob .
the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with map card , you &apos;ll receive a card postcard together with the previous View and floating t@@ ank@@ le the view is not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just now &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to start any more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this manual , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among the beginn@@ ings are very popular : a sphere at one level .
but you should read the following war@@ nings , before you need to use it as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should notice this important rules :
if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules can be applied for the pension as a result you can get a black image .
if you have no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture .
if you have any faul@@ t@@ less installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ set window order :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable performance what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols now , therefore , you should have the menus and symbols , and their use .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you need to remove all objects from the object tree . generate the scene and then choose the menu entry for extinc@@ tion . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene , which you generate . in particular , this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the scene from the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on the view of the view object properties , in which the different parameters of the camera will find . in user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you can find further details .
do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , but you can change the camera in view of control points , with which you can change the target point of camera . click on the left mouse button on a control point and draw him to the desired site .
if you want to push the button or press En@@ ter , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately accordingly to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might set a Qu@@ ader ( Insert body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a constant method for solution to this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; this is actually a simple possibility . you can use an infin@@ ite level as ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press En@@ ter . in the object there will be the new name immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , if also at the moment just as a limited level . when you ren@@ dering the scene , the level rises to the h@@ oriz@@ on .
if you can see the object tree that you can see the entry for the floor . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , allowing you to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
choose from the bottom to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a little bit multiple .
in both cases a dialog can be displayed in which you can select the object . please select the name in the property view . you can see the name in the property view ( Name = bottom Pigment ) , with a click on the button . you can see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a minor black material , because you can check the settings for the pig@@ ment . give you the colors of materials at any time . give it a lot of possibilities for the pig@@ ment . there is also many ways of possibilities , but you can now take the eas@@ iest way .
if you don &apos;t look in a preview of any colour on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button , then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ ew your image now with a click on the symbol , you should receive the following result :
of course , this is not the colour code . you can also use further settings . in the Far@@ ben@@ list you need two new attri@@ butes . then you can do this entry twice ( you can also do more often , but the chess boards can only be used only with two colors ) :
in the object tree or change the colours in the object properties :
this step should already be simply run , as you have already understood the general work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be just as easy as the ground :
in view of the object properties you can change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the ball contact with the bottom . otherwise , the ball would be floating above the bottom , because you would need the bottom to bottom a unit below .
of course the ren@@ dering now makes a strange result : as previously shown above , the ball surface is like a bit of black material . put on a suitable material in the following step .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now show a material now . as in the bottom , give the ball a pig@@ ment as a colour :
choose first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on Sp@@ ice Pigment , select Single Fabri@@ cs and put the values like follows :
but you can reach an interesting effects , when you take the time , some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screens and click on en@@ abling or press En@@ ter .
the settings are brightness effect and re@@ flex@@ ion with some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal is not selected :
you should now have a good impression that offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; offers . hop@@ efully you have already learned as much as you have to create beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a ren@@ der method to generate a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene , or a model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the ren@@ der of hyp@@ oth@@ etic rays from the pro@@ spect of the subject ( i.e. from the camera supporting the scenes ) is reflected by objects of light sources in the scene and how atmosph@@ eric effects of light sources will work out as fog mode . so , the scene will be processed for pixel pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see anything , the picture is simple . obviously , every scene needs to be ordered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files are usually the file extension * .@@ pov or * .@@ inc .

a B@@ ump map is one way to change hair@@ y surfaces , without any be@@ ule on the surface individually mod@@ eling and without the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as a tex@@ ture Map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from do@@ zen , or even hundreds of these principles . these models are then processed , to give them a realistic look .
a tex@@ ture map is one way to give the surface of an object colour on pixel basis , by appl@@ ying a image file as color chart .

&amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that doesn &apos;t want to scan up more than images and can be p@@ added .
&amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that can &apos;t make more than images to scan and pick up . can be saved for each image to store and save images in a specified file with automatically generated name and format . the user can also show images before the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ ip@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not open , or if no standard scanner is given , then a dialog appears to choose the scanner .
the user can choose to use the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . breaking down &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite .
further settings contain more detailed options of driver . &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) are not treated these options .
in order to start a picture , the user may only start a fe@@ eds and then scanning the scanning range for the final scan . the feed can be started through the preview button .
in order to choose the image better , the user can also zoom in the image and out of the current selection . he can also set the zoom even so that the whole preview can fits into the window .
if the picture has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if Before the store a preview can be selected into the settings , then the image will be displayed in a feed table , but when stor@@ ing is pressed , then the image is stored and sc@@ lie ? en leads to a break@@ through and you will come back into the main window .
through the knob , the ep@@ on@@ ymous dialog is open before the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before the store . in this case , the option must be selected a preview of Save a preview . if this preview can &apos;t be desired , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; pictures stored in front of each picture . when &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; they will automatically save automatically with a generated name in a defined file , then you &apos;ll need to ask a file names without any file names .
this setting defines where the pictures can be saved without any file names without any file names . if the images are stored after any scan , then the default value is used as a standard for the dialog to store . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the door knob .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically stored images and is moreover the proposed name for the picture in dialogue to store . the automatically stored picture gets an numer@@ ic su@@ ff@@ ix of the anyway . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust to save image quality sound quality . this value does not change the compression value for saving . if Select image quality is not selected , the default value of Q@@ t will be used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE @-@ help with the &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button in starts the K@@ DE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ ab@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sk@@ er@@ ite .

you can use existing multimedia buttons so that it work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short command work . therefore make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the control centre .
the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which is also available in other K@@ DE programs . this section is made from six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list and scrip@@ ts . a sample call for the D@@ COP function could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still has some of its own command lines options .
you should give the user a feedback , if the script will not be carried out if the modules are available due to a lack , whether all the modules are available and use the dialog box , that user reference is not running .

in scrip@@ ts scrip@@ ts / Tem@@ plates you can find a lot of pre @-@ scrip@@ ts in many different languages . they can be used as base for your own scrip@@ ts or they simply determine that the writing of scrip@@ ts is relatively simple .
using D@@ COP you can exchange your scrip@@ ts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p , which should be supplied with the installation .
most sk@@ ri@@ pt@@ ors allow the lead of external programs and commands . it is usually used to be Ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way it can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sen@@ ds al@@ ert to all running scrip@@ ts . in this reason you should monitor their standard input from the scrip@@ ts and compl@@ eting the events . of course , a script cannot ign@@ ore the events , if there is no use for this .
con@@ figure shows the script file to display the store dialog . when sc@@ ri@@ pt started to take care . if a sk@@ ri@@ pt is started , Amar@@ ok the working folder on the folder , where all data are stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alized that a new piece is now used . the script could now be &amp; z@@ b ; using d@@ COP functions for further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume Sign@@ izes a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ rating between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ary Cli@@ cked : sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title &#93; the path to select the selected menu of the play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu item can be presented with the menu entry , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remov@@ ing d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remov@@ e@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ et ( sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if the user stops a sk@@ ri@@ pt , sen@@ ds &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M will be processed on the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. the store data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok Sk@@ ri@@ pt File administration can also install Sk@@ ri@@ pt packages , which can be downloaded from a web@@ server ; such pack@@ ets are also compatible with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which allows users to recognize an archive name as for example .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept sk@@ ri@@ pt packages with the enlar@@ gement amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should start your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ ut@@ able ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ ut@@ able . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can charge it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the W@@ iki Sk@@ ri@@ ques side of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scrip@@ ts .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in summary of functions and gallery with screens .
Amar@@ ok requires only the K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs so ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find modules or scrip@@ ts ) . we have a small instructions , as you compiled K@@ deli@@ bs .
some features such as OS@@ D is pre@@ dict that your window manager will keep relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ to@@ p.@@ org . for example , we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these represent a excellent development environment .
probably , you can see one of your files into the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can see this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang onto the broken file that caused the crash file . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly is that Tag@@ lib appeared in the met@@ a file from this file system crashing : please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit older .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libr@@ aries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crash when working the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able automatic , if in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ side via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will be automatically adjusted to a crash ) . if it has a common contact crash , and it is guaranteed to have a good back@@ side , the error is guaranteed .
this is that many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 to write the met@@ a info , but not as unic@@ ode . the following Per@@ l sk@@ ri@@ pt fixes the problem .

there are some possibilities . most Install@@ ations clar@@ ify by the help of an expert on your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also seek help to other users or use the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the canal # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please apply only one error , if you &apos;re something on the asser@@ tion of an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; just a blank play@@ list . how do you come into pieces there ?
that is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired file . then move the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window into the statistic window was converted into the statistic window . you can find it under Extr@@ as Statist@@ ics .
the meaning of this symbols has changed by Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user , while the points will automatically be calculated .
to evalu@@ ate pieces , in the play@@ list , the value list will be displayed . click somewhere in the new rating column , to evalu@@ ate the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
if you want to remove the files , you want to remove un@@ lock on your keyboard . or click on your selection and then choose from play@@ list .
pull a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would like to make it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the Add @-@ button , Store the button list . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look even after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ iz@@ ations .
the equalizer can be reached in the context @-@ text menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar below extras ....
no . Yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used a real question of what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty any of the real audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can even convert text and PNG de@@ enc@@ ode !
it may be ! perhaps you can use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with default no MP3 decoder ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 re@@ de , En@@ ter .
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . this can be used to use a mixer with hardware @-@ mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . look at the help of the help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem , you need to specify a different s@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
the do &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget to send the media first if you are looking for a white noise . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ enc@@ oded them and sen@@ ds the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ d the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can be align@@ ed directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimi@@ ze the settings of Arts . open the sound server with highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ap@@ per is dis@@ continued :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs which can read playback . Read this error message . Read the picture of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setting file .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c can also help .

l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can be combined into the quality and speed with commercial encoder . l@@ ame will be used from MP3 Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source codec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so that you can read FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : further libr@@ aries for the processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to convert audio CD to combust@@ en@@ .@@ de@@ co
SO@@ x : a manual program that can hin@@ ts between different audio formats and can be used . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for the video file . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ Mag@@ er : a fully equipped car system used to edit , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ ze video CDs and video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be used to adjust the sound level of music files to a standard level . it can be mean@@ ing@@ ful for example of mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections . without normal@@ izing the different albums on the un@@ beautiful effect that the musicians are different according to the music file .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and will automatically get all videos in the base folder of CD .
this is a comfortable method , recently opened projects again . the corresponding menu menu includes a list of this projects . click on an entry opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project was already stored once again , the previously created file , otherwise stated after a new fil@@ ename .
stores the current project under a new fil@@ ename . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed , with the file and fil@@ ename for the project file .
stores all open@@ ly projects . this is the same as if you want to store for each individual project file .
includes the current project . if a project changed and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what happened . you can also choose between Save and Ch@@ anges . also , you can also leave the closing and the project so open .
clos@@ es all the opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each of the stored project , what would happen to happen , just as would have been called for each project file .
includes all open@@ ings projects and termin@@ ated &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each of the stored project is asked what would happen to happen if you have called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select the same effect as if you select files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , so the added files in the base file of the CD will appear .
opens the dialog &quot; Firing &quot; for the current project . this dialog is the same thing as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the Medi@@ ation . the burning @-@ dialog can only be open when the project has already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can take a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry was published only with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . it is useful if you &apos;re not used files for a multi @-@ session CD . this function is not used for you , even if this function is not used for you , so you can see the existing files and folders .
this entry was published only with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this function perc@@ eived files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function remov@@ es no files from the medium , they bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy @-@ in dialogue . this allows you to create a copy of a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also burn any point of cl@@ oning , instead of normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy @-@ in dialogue . this enables you to create a DVD copy of a DVD copy , which can &apos;t be able to burn any DVD with the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the complete ( video ) data of the source code in the original form .
opens the dialogue to solve a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialogue to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . this dialog can be form@@ at@@ ted a DVD ± R ( W ) , which allows the contents completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose your choice between write models and incre@@ mental .
bur@@ ns an previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can immediately be immediately supported by pressing the burning @-@ button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ nr@@ g files are currently not supported , you must use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
if a previously created DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks for a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can immediately be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a previously selected DVD video can be converted from this dialogue window . this slide window appears to be used after reading a DVD in the ingredients , but can also be used too . it contains information about the chosen video , co@@ di@@ ments and even possibilities to modify the size and cutting black edges .
shows information about the inserted medium . these information will be shown in the ingredients and include features of the media , such as size and titles on CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if a record is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small kol@@ od@@ est at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status is bl@@ ends .
switches the file view or out . the file view is activated , and the content view is activated , the content contained in the ingredients . CD / DVD drives have also create a text menu with functions such as media info , sper@@ m and un@@ lock of the drive or throw of the media .
for this purpose , the site view is or out . the site view enables the select and pul@@ ling files into the project view . the site view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder .
this is the head of the head@@ line in the project view . the head view is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area , which is only visible , if the project view open projects . the head@@ lines has no real function , it looks pretty nice from and separates the project view clear from the remaining views .
this opens a key window to modify the key arran@@ gem@@ ents for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key rules below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; inser@@ tion assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs are therefore required to enter system management rights , so you must enter the password for the system management ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program settings can be performed . almost all the functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on suit . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and intended for the program of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ sk@@ ri@@ pt .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or something more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are decisive in the function key , therefore , rather your taste and the type of your task is cru@@ cial , which of both programs you will be .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . in order to make sure you need to make sure &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then give something like the following console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program measured , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ COP interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , provides functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void cop@@ y@@ C@@ d ( ) void cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) void thy n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( / KUR@@ L ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ image ( KUR@@ L ur@@ l )
as a result sol@@ ch of a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project will receive via # d@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is applicable only on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
Vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ Name ) void set@@ back@@ ID ( Q@@ String path )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script file . for example , the following script will generate a data project , several file and inserted files into the new file :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@
&amp; audio o@@ cre@@ ator ; is a audio CD ; reader for &amp; cold ; . with him can easily read audio CD ; s read and can be stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the machine installed on the machine .
&amp; audio o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading &amp; CD ; file data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and of many co@@ di@@ ers , which are supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( lost compression ) . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in WAV files on the machine ( loss free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( generally indicates a pro @-@ title ) comp@@ resses to the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats like the loss free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read out of &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers are already installed . all these programs are already installed in any Linux distribution boxes , but only the co@@ di@@ ers are installed , which will not be used . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , this installation is not necessary .
which co@@ di@@ er@@ ers / file format should be used ? the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio quality and Com@@ pression factors .
a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is not possible to handle any copy protection . in any case , &amp; audio cre@@ ator ; even do not allow the mechan@@ isms of copy protection . avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup may only be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often up to a suitable configuration ) , after a suitable configuration . this leads ( hop@@ efully ) to understanding the sli@@ m approach to the interface , about which you are often stum@@ ble .
can convert in many formats - depending on which co@@ di@@ ers are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of orders of the main window . on the page step for step example , more information is used as well as screens and descriptions of the regist@@ ers for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to request in the CD@@ DB . ( this may be loc@@ ally or online , in the latter case , first to be produced on the Internet . )
starts reading and - if a encoder is config@@ ured in the tab tab setting up - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection with another encoder can be read as standard . it &apos;s notice that the encoder has been config@@ ured in the tab tab in the align@@ ment dialog .
opens the file manager so that an exec@@ uting file can be selected to enc@@ ode instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and enc@@ ode .
opens the access dialog to con@@ figure the type of not@@ if@@ ications ( such as protocols , pie@@ p@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) .
opens the main facilities dialog by &amp; audio o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different card cards ( like Encoder , for inser@@ tion of encoder ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully applied !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression rates and helps you at the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is to be lost , there is also other like &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available for these files .
among the audio formats , we lose information through data compression ever after their p@@ sycho@@ acou@@ st@@ ical model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG can now have a slight advantage of MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kbps ) , but more than these bit@@ rate will produce less important because both co@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ High up to very high sound quality ( at high Bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower low grade of bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or any calcul@@ ator @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are present .
MP3 - if you are on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - support these tools usually only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and turns out of the compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transpar@@ ency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transpar@@ ency , and has already high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kbps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for a complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kbps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs more than 256 kbps for complex and less complex items . some older devices need CBR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kbps C@@ BR , common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kbps for all pieces of a title . good gen@@ ug for music by adol@@ esc@@ ents , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os@@ ystems . but not good enough for better stereo hi @-@ fi systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kbps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments should be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , but if you don &apos;t want to have the absolutely highest quality without return to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , enter manually or by the program will be taken from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program available as a list of parameter . you can be delivered / used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the co@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ ers programs , there are often a combination of programming settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; adding to the key@@ boards ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3s has to be enc@@ oded with l@@ ame , the switch player from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; audio o@@ cre@@ ator ; added the result looks like that : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button in assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which the audio CDs can be read out in the calcul@@ ator . it is written here only from text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
Yes , it should be legal to be legal , but I am not att@@ orney from the &amp; CD ; this is that public on the &amp; CD ; there is no more valuable , so , neither the artist is able to damage the music company damage . all information can be ad@@ vised by a b@@ umm@@ el through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; it is active a check box ( S@@ end of an address ) . for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , it seems to be used in the system . this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used for the server , but only the programm@@ ers know that the code is checked . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; cop@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , shall be used to be used as the nearest reflection server . this saves bandwidth on network and res@@ em@@ bles the load between the b@@ ills .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror @-@ ver@@ n for online A@@ bru@@ f by &amp; CD ; for information while exercis@@ ing a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded , or ( generally issued monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which is the read@@ out program uses pieces of the &amp; CD ; store in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know , search in the source code .... This was already the best choice for the output of audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done .
for stor@@ ing the selected WAV files , the co@@ di@@ ers , and thus the desired file format will be selected . in the first open@@ ings for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a reliable compression for audio data ) . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the co@@ ater package must be installed by the running Linux distribution , before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also possible for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a co@@ di@@ er@@ ers , further information can be obtained via the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ en@@ window ( eg ; console ) . there must be &apos; l@@ ame &apos; to be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the device of device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) , try to stop both programs with a command line in a terminal .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the case of &amp; CD ; this will not be happy !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use any other settings , this tips may be like to use .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will have enough information about to make those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with an V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v1 j@@ uni@@ ors ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found as not totally free software . anyway , it &apos;s not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , what you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you have write permission to own ( eg ; trying to copy slightly in the con@@ quer@@ or anything ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; , something which is probably done only once .
the second section describes the presentation of a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each item &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we provide to use co@@ di@@ ers for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 kbps ) , as well as the structure we are using to use the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to use the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet down .
although we can change this settings at any time , we will probably do probably at any output of a &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is delivered to the selected program that the &amp; CD ; read data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom a sym@@ bo@@ lic link to the real device name of your running computer . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be connected to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to the existing entries of the device drawings for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General settings . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown , as shown in screen photo .
only If un@@ complete information , please select that you are not@@ ified when information is missing ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download on the internet of a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
NOTE : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading &amp; CD ; with the internet , that he can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , it is easier to read the &amp; CD ; that &apos;s with low risk name / file names or day entries , you can change it easily with the database and file names , they may be changed with consist@@ encies - &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter all manually , you can download the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b . however , these can be able to use this more than 620 MB , you must be selected this twice , at least the selected fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are the settings for the data @-@ request , for the phone &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b servers on the Internet . how knows the system that get the CD ? please read the section over fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as in screen photo .
mode : we have not downloaded the database here , we want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look at a mirror server in your proximity . on this way the load is distributed between the b@@ ills . this setting will work as the first attempt .
both will work similar to the server , as many fire@@ works the Protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to sur@@ fers on the Internet .
in this example , we want no &amp; CD ; data files on fre@@ ed@@ b server . it should be able to activ@@ ate the first check box .
just take the settings of the screenshot of screenshot . ( make sure the file / tmp is exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously trig@@ gered pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why any more than one at the same time in only one existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es and enc@@ ode ? the author knows it not , therefore try to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this on to throw the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
custom file for temporary files : if you have access this , then it must be stored in which the WAV files are stored in which the files are not crossed in the private file , if you don &apos;t want to do files in the private file , if you do not want to do anything with the WAV files .
all such as it is on the screen photo . the command is something long , under circumstances must be fed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi system , the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
NOTE the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted if needed also . kidney 3 is an outstanding variables for the names of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use except this sample iels :
number of simultaneous WAV files : at a dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to enc@@ ode more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is it , we just finished the basic device of &amp; audio @-@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each item of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organization &apos;s structure of your music , you never need them to change it again .
in this section , this section is described as the process of the read@@ iness on the hard disk . we will create a connection to the music on the hard drive , because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from fre@@ ed@@ b will be able to re@@ cover the process of this section , must be repeated for each serving &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , see the screens are a little different from as those for a &amp; CD ; they will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of them out of the internet . Comments will be displayed on the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; this example happens . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet happen , the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive , defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length are listed in the window , as in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then search in section Questions and Ans@@ wers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been p@@ icked out by fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles of the pieces were already filled and will also be displayed in the name of the artist and the album .
for the case that it is more than a record in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window insert , and you can select the database entry that your opinion will fit for your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings can choose from the dialog for the settings ) , you can &apos;t have any local database , but require the data from the internet , you require the link to the internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : CD Editor &apos;s CD @-@ data and the Tit@@ els of the First piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; accordingly to the model on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the &apos; current title &apos; , the rest of data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist is not to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , unless you have a comp@@ ilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower Comm@@ entary field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ divi@@ du@@ el per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments on all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful A@@ bru@@ f of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b is not empty , but it contains always a good idea to check the contents of the CD Ed@@ itors , lest you begin with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with big letters start or not ... ) , but also to prove whether there is any un@@ wanted remarks .
NOTE : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ tags . this is limited the length of the fields for the artists , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comments . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have an unlimited Fel@@ dl@@ ands . this option is set up on the tab card ; let it take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the Tag version of the generated files later with the day editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see you in the help to obtain more information .
simply choose one entry that is evi@@ dent with the style of the unusual CD ; it is not important because we don &apos;t want to talk about the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are available under rock .
after the selection of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors will be back and you see that the fields for the album has been filled with the specified data , which we have chosen for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . click the title of the piece in each case and others information that wish .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure the same way up to you all the title of the &amp; CD ; entered .
please note : this window will not be downloaded , if you have downloaded data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already written in one of these categories of database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . NOTE that the artist and the album can be displayed on the list .
NOTE that there are a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected , or out , make sure that all the pieces should select one or out the button . select all the pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at one time .
was launched by cli@@ cking on the button selection of the read@@ able process , this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the contracts and track what will become .
click on the tab to switch on the order window . it is on the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . this is just read on the hard drive . status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message you can try to work with a co@@ di@@ ers , which you don &apos;t have installed with a co@@ di@@ ers , which have not been successfully implemented with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the file for the TM@@ P file and the target file are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have a write access to the file for temporary files and target file ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the lecture of the first piece .
the mission 1 reads the first piece of it , it is finished . but we have completed a new record : Contract 4 is the coding of pieces 1 in the format MP3 . thus , please read and coding in parallel . NOTE the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings , to read this behavior , the number of parallel processes is to read and enc@@ ode . with powerful machines , the result is un@@ clear . the calcul@@ ator is not a problem with the simultaneous reading and enc@@ ode ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last titles is read , while another piece is enc@@ oded and a third order in the waiting long of the co@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a little window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you will need &amp; cra@@ p ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need to your choice your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if you have chosen with CV@@ S , you can download from there an anon@@ ymous package . most distri@@ butions are already included in an anon@@ ymous package . if you install this package k@@ dem@@ and@@ media from your distribution . if you read this , you &apos;re probably already done ...
this section is aimed to comp@@ ile the source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , as the program may be adapted for your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different other programs , has many variants to learn . best for example to learn the options and settings . it shows screens from different card cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , always yet to read ? even if only the help was cli@@ cked out after the first strong start of the program , without any point out spot ( above all , if the program is no audio CD ; in the drive is ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can not be ad@@ vent@@ ured . it is known as the first version for a manual and audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you can always do it . at least after the contact with the author and if you read this section , he has understood this section and is therefore understood with this proposal .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N you don &apos;t need to use this information but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; . besides other , he did not have real @-@ time graph@@ ical and kar@@ aoke @-@ real texts of texts also some features , the others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultra@@ Sound @-@ Proj@@ ector , which is used for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is used as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graph@@ ical display of activity of any MIDI @-@ channel by high@@ ligh@@ ten buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .

seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; while recording of a song , S@@ id will start again with the same song .
supports external MIDI @-@ synth@@ esizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US maps ( for latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first you can choose ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
you can also use a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this works also with multiple songs simultaneously .
to watch a music piece , open it and run the button to play in the tool bar , select the entry version out of the menu item from or to make the space taste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically , once you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( at several pieces they will be added to a collection and then fold in succ@@ ession . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is able to ski@@ p you to a popular place by using the middle button and drive away with the control .
if you find that a song is fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows to the right and on the right of the template . to get the original pace , click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space taste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the push button or the select menu entry in the menu item , interrup@@ ts the playback . if no item is played , it starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
ly@@ rics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use ly@@ rics and other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust the events that should be displayed automatically and even better : the event settings will be selected automatically , so you will automatically choose the kar@@ aoke text , but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to adjust the events type , select from the menu settings the text entries and song events . the same function have also the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you are merg@@ ed . these will be played in this section as you can use collections efficient .
to put a collection , first open the collection manager . these can be found in the menu collection below the point .... click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by copy in copy and then click the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the required values in the collection manager .
into the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection will not be stored . concerns the when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs for a collection , it must be selected in the gathering manager . there you can add to add a song . it appears in again the file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setting of automation .
if Automatic Add to the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( using a file or drag &amp; drop ) automatically add to active collection .
when automatic add to the collection is not enabled , when the piece of a piece is activated , the collection will be activated and sent . this collection will continue to be added .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection of collec@@ ting the collection and select the desired song , and then click below .
you can choose the order , in which the songs will be played . if you select a series of the menu sequence of the menus , the songs were played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add a time or remove a random order in the menu , the order will be established .
to match a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list on the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump to a song , select the knob Next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the arrow right .
to jump back a song , select the knob pre @-@ made piece of the menu , or press the left arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter if they are stored at the leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not stored .
this is necess@@ arily necessary for synth@@ esizer that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events in events that stands the synth@@ esizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ Map , which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and therefore always a trumpet , if it should play a piano .
if you have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards GM is compatible ( including A@@ WE and G@@ US maps , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . you have to edit the corresponding file of hand ( with your favourite d@@ itor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that needs all necessary conver@@ sions for the play of a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which is so often appear as desired . for that , however , each additional tex@@ ti@@ d poss@@ esses a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
check PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END LE@@ KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... END define KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; an additional key@@ map ... QU@@ END MO@@ CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END options ... END
you see that it is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and END that the end of a Section@@ es is reached .
please send your map file as e @-@ mail , so I can get in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , how the patches are shown by General MIDI on your specific keyboard . the general use can be seen as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation mark is ig@@ no@@ red . it is believed that GM @-@ patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds , who doesn &apos;t need this instrument on the sound with the number M ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section .
so if now a MIDI file is playing a score with Patch 127 ( R@@ if@@ ications ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and play the sound 60 , regardless of which sound in the MIDI file stands .
please note that here with the term drum @-@ patch of Patch ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that means the sound height of the same drum ( such as some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds are depic@@ ted on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section is the order of lines very important , as well as their advantages . you must create 128 entries .
you can define several con@@ ym@@ es for each channel and each instrument . you must only use different names only in the first line .
Ke@@ ym@@ aps are mainly used to remove sounds on the per@@ cus@@ sion@@ er channels . look like the included Ke@@ ym@@ aps .
this section can be used to switch some channels on other types . if you want to switch the first and the second channel , simply make the very simple to the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following pattern :
N is one of the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you are using the key@@ map option . if you are using the key@@ map option , all events are ig@@ no@@ red , which are ignor@@ ing the patch on this channel . in this case , we will always use patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ cus@@ sion@@ er patch on the c@@ aster channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Ratio can be multip@@ lied with the value of pitch ben@@ ds . if so , if a MIDI file will be converted with the value of n * ( r / 4096 ) and then only rel@@ ayed . the value is 4096 will be used , thus in the map file is no dec@@ imal number .
this setting is used because GM provides that a keyboard , that is a pitch of a pitch of 4096 , a sound higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards to play two sounds up to one oct@@ ave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) . on these sounds you can be played , which sounds just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain canal . for each channel there is a selection list where you have changed an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , no more green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views to indicate the sounds tones . view in the menu settings under the point of the channel view : settings
Tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played , the higher the number , the larger the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to change the text , you can use it . to change the temp@@ o , use the arrows to the right and the right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about it like a music piece . it contains the notes , the rhyth@@ m , the speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can use ni@@ em@@ ously z@@ win@@ gen , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . they have control over all .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , DE@@ B ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; it &apos;s that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support . to solve the problem , you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
to be understood , therefore , &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the file that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and draw them on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
in advance , activ@@ ate the setting for the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can find the arrow button on the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o , click the LCD double .
I &apos;ve played a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way I need to play a kar@@ aoke file or I &apos;d like to play a file , only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window switch and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen to a file , if you add one file to the collection , then switch the setting of Automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
supp@@ ose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . once you want to play the first file . so set the setting of Automatic Add to the Collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then you can also connect B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you make that ?
these people have sent MIDI files or postcards . all many thanks ! when I see this songs or see the postcard , animated me to program and k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ros@@ a.@@ J@@ imen@@ ez ; from Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; lag@@ a . I &apos;m not much free time for my ho@@ b@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take me a bit time . when ho@@ b@@ bies I program , MIDI files are doing , music doing and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you want a question or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want me easily want to make me a e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you can really make a giant thing if you send a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file of a local group . if you want to send a MIDI file , but should you contact a MIDI file , but should you contact with me , since I have perhaps the file maybe already .
I have and k@@ mid ; it is written in my leisure time and of ni@@ em@@ an@@ ion for money . I would like to make sure that I get further programs , because when I get back of users ( postcards or e @-@ ma@@ ils ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the error , that the pitch at the A@@ WE cards was too high .

and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians in the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid also may be found on his homepage , which can look at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ .@@ html . on the homepage , you can find the development and look at page . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synth@@ esizer , because the sound quality is essential from your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an A@@ WE Map .
if you have no sound card , you have to comp@@ ile and k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs when you would have a sound@@ card that you can &apos;t hear music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ ma@@ iling lists or send an error message directly to me .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ro@@ uting windows . there are always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is the window with the play@@ list . and finally there is a information window , which will only be displayed if information is in this window .
it is possible to compare the preferred connections among the menu Bookmark the menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries to each other , you should use the category play@@ ful play@@ list .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ arch@@ ie@@ e level . if you copies a record , his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category , and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list may also be changed through direct edit the XML configur@@ ing files . however , you can choose from a editor , but also by the application itself . simply by the menu , select only the next mode . by cli@@ cking one sub@@ group only the XML content will be displayed by this team .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the menu and select either the processing mode , or any other category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode leave or another group will be selected without leaving the play@@ list .
as a result of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some features can only be switched on using the XML configuration files .
the animation of the starting and end can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify the option of &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activ@@ ate a other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Apps / k@@ m@@ player / or .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format has to be a supported XML file .
the animation of the Start does not need to be short , it will be completed automatically by the opening of another source . this would be an end of animation , but the user can end an application for a second time .
a simple example of a Start @-@ animation can be : &amp; lt ; spr@@ ints ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ defin@@ ite &quot; src = &quot; file : &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ iled ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in the list tests / some examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a ri@@ ders on the configuration of M@@ players in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate @-@ size of the Dat@@ enst@@ ro@@ ms from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the knob &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player can be conf@@ id@@ ent .
there is no ri@@ ders for this re @-@ dispens@@ er in configuration dialog box ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like that &apos;s the back@@ end via m@@ im@@ et@@ y@@ pe . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be used to add the special field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
in order to re@@ cover the &amp; player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; player device ; module has to be specified as service providers for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash to the specified assign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a con@@ sol@@ ation application for the store of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the console menu ) .
this is always a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual modify the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files will be played :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play by TV cards , either using a player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) , you must be config@@ ured to use the device and the TV channels . it can be edited manually from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .

is there any@@ how I can do my CD@@ ROM drive if I play from him ( not given by the VCD : / / ) ?
Yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root after the device of the device . it is absolutely safe to make that / dev / c@@ drom to the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphic user surfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ arti@@ s systems probably will likely be back on the package &amp; tex@@ ture ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; version distribution should be included . the installation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be applied .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project includes some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these enable an easy installation without additional comp@@ ile and are included in the k@@ ile ; web site included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; &amp; Linux ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced user must hardly read these manual . however , all proposals for documentation is taken into account . if the support is required to this project or documentation , the contact about k@@ ile ; web site should be manufactured .
if you have any questions or re@@ comp@@ ile , you should select any extensions , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list c@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; setting for use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graph@@ ical surface and easy access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ ile and sigh@@ t@@ elling within the source tex@@ ture as well as transformation and sigh@@ t@@ elling within the source code , the light and lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual about Kate . users from &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin directly with the reading of Capital and Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right choice : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . to use it is a La@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros use . a less challeng@@ ing but realistic er@@ asing is that it desc@@ end from Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
this is just a great attention to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book on it . by &amp; lat@@ ex ; A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
similarly , like other instruc@@ tors includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction that are defined by the command \ \ , ent@@ class , the cheese starts with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { Document } .
the fast @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an important function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of assist@@ ants ( menu ) offers some examples for creating the document . it can also be carried out some of the document related settings .
document : this is the type of documents to create documents . article &#91; letter &#93; , article &#91; letter &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ut@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this is used to use the character codes . modern systems should use enc@@ oding the UTF @-@ 8 enc@@ oding as a standard . however , UTF @-@ 8@@ X should be controlled ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains mostly additional packages for and lat@@ ex ; for connecting the SS@@ EN they are only fully grown in the check field .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ ent@@ atives of Kom@@ a Script ( to comply with the German DIN rules ) . you should always find in the creation of German texts .
new users are now available . it is just a short description of functions and further information will be given in section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - same as other source file ed@@ itors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , it is possible with high prob@@ ability to see that any math@@ emati@@ cal environment has not closed it . however , it is possible due to the mod@@ est appearance of the output file . however , it is possible through the high@@ lighting time and output .
with the automatic version of the use of a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a space ( for input of the text ) and the connected line to the command . this function can be de@@ activated in menu .
all documents are divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; ex@@ h@@ ated the part@@ itions of the document in the following items ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ tle the lower element ) :
at the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective and considered .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; ger@@ many file ( English D e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) &#93; created , navig@@ ating &amp; k@@ ile ; due to a click with the mean mouse button in DVI ; Panel viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of format document and also other information such as the Fon@@ ts and is beside PDF the media output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the RÃ ¼ ck@@ w@@ Ã ¤ r@@ ts@@ search , the elements of the DVI ; file can be cli@@ cked on the exact opposite of it . once on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; Panel viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used for work with several files . with a master document , the work is simplified . with a project , a project can be simplified .@@ tex -@@ files . when using a project , project project can be set to project project settings .
Quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and displayed automatically ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
file control : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file on the cat@@ er@@ un@@ gen@@ â ¬ , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; after the fast installation .
in consider@@ ation of the edit tool@@ bar , the three high @-@ wide selection of selection . the selection of selection is for the fast delivery of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... The refer@@ end@@ ous &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instructions for the part@@ itions are :
the optional Additional is for sale of articles such as Tags , fox , notes or ver@@ ify of articles , such as keywords are :
name : this command is created for a section , an image or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed designation ( sel@@ ecting a selection box ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list of literary entries are displayed . in &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate ed@@ itors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand is written .
the last evaluation field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¨ s is used for the design of the font site . it is possible to set the font file for the main text , the Fu@@ Ã ¤ notes etc . there are the following fon@@ ts to ver@@ ify :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two excep@@ tions for creating a new document for creating a new document and the fundament@@ als of the settings . 2 . the document can be written on the hand with the hand .
the stap@@ les after the command \ \ b@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specif@@ ies the font color . if the font is not set to start in the beginning , this also can happen in the text .
as soon as the above source code , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the eas@@ iest way for this is the use of the menu or button .
the source code must be stored before the comp@@ ile . &amp; c@@ ile ; for stor@@ ing automatically .
a comp@@ ilation of the document , should be searched for errors , should be started automatically . if using a quick installation , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the prot@@ oc@@ ation should be noted .
a environment ( English environment ) is a text , which is different as the remaining document . for example , the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } , \ \ H@@ uge and \ \ end { environment } ex@@ h@@ ated that of the correspondence should be reached within the surrounding area of Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ am ( engl@@ . H@@ uge ) .
the changes are only within the environment ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } up to \ \ end { Environment } ) . there is no limit@@ ations ( number ) for changes within a environment .
there are many rooms for use of the document and user @-@ fri@@ endl@@ iness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . add these commands either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the surrounding area .
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive strength and is tempor@@ arily closed , until he will be closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another surroundings . a single word can be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { words } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
after writing the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the statement language is presented , follows a step @-@ for @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once a bit text was entered into a bit text , a few adjust@@ ments for the better read of document must be accompl@@ ished . for this purpose , a quote , a few digits in the fat and cur@@ sive printing and a po@@ em to use to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor @-@ view or Ctr@@ l E back to the editor ( when an internal viewer ) must be closed with an external viewer .
as soon as the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or in a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted . easy to test and fun .
DVI ; is a straight file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the reading of some in the computers . there are many different types of .@@ dv@@ i -@@ output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer monitors .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; the same steps are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after cli@@ cking on DVI , the document can be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar ex@@ h@@ ates the conversion of the DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code can be created , the conversion can start in certain other formats using the buttons on the tool@@ bar .
the advance search goes directly to the editor &apos;s direct jump from editor to da@@ al@@ located position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -B@@ 2 files . for this , only modern under settings can be set aside ... tools building site .
in order to test the advance search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a row of the source tex@@ tured and , in order to make suggest@@ ions in a row . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; in a click of the mean mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document can be inj@@ ected and appropriate ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; as text editor should be specified ( settings of oc@@ ep@@ iece ... editor )
if using a quick installation of &amp; DVI ; please do not hes@@ itate to be a mistake . if an error occurred , this is displayed in the prot@@ oc@@ ation file , or in the news window .
the prot@@ oc@@ ation file contains the error source in the source code . in the editor file , the protocol file may always be used in relation to the error , in which the error appears to be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file , jum@@ ps to def@@ aul@@ ts line .
once you are cli@@ cked on the appropriate button in the tool bar , a window will be used for sel@@ ecting the template for the document . the pre @-@ set programs are :
with a selection of empty document , a document may be re @-@ written either from the reason or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . further information are included in the section .
sigh@@ ting users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually the same introduction for almost all documents . tem@@ plates can be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; stored , stored and loaded to facil@@ itate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or a new file can be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template that create an existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document , some character types can be replaced by other data ( e.g. Name or character oding ) . these variables can be set in settings ... Settings ...
therefore , it is therefore necessary to know which the variables will be replaced by which variables will be replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by the input in document class : \ \ _ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the eas@@ iest way to create a template &apos;s application is the use of assist@@ ants , and thus the orders received in the editor . once the document have been created following this way :
when creating a new document , the own template instead of the standard would be balanced .
an template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; it will be created a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one in the internet , and the written steps should be carried out .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programming and high@@ ways of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly in menu tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his stomach can be moved to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be viewed directly with the reading of Capital and Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command device which can be called for the help of the La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find an exceptional description of almost all commands that can find in &amp; lat@@ ex ; used as well as their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with bent Ctr@@ l -@@ button to convert the &amp; tex ; meaning that way up to the cli@@ cking to \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par must .
when writing the text with the left @-@ down lin@@ ker Mau@@ st@@ aste , the text is automatically cop@@ ied into the intermediate shelf .
when using the arrow keys , button keys can be balanced with the source tex@@ tured in the ed@@ or@@ window window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; the correct types of source texts to brow@@ se and these are distingu@@ ished . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the commands from the normal text and also the math@@ emati@@ cal form@@ ul@@ as are distingu@@ ished by another colour .
many assist@@ ants k@@ ills additional jum@@ ps . this is an own kind of Bookmark within the text . the menu brand or the corresponding key stamp . also this spr@@ ing@@ stamp will be raised , so that they will be automatic for the first input of a character .
the work is probably one of the main asp@@ ir@@ ation when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; more important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is always under@@ going for many environments and groups and therefore under@@ scores ; special commands for their selection . under review are the following commands are available :
a complete paragraph of ( group of lines that contain on both sides one empty line ) . this expanded significance does not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of source tex@@ ture . it is that the only be@@ ats can be separated by two empty lines .
the word below the current c@@ ursor position . this selection has also an extended meaning that this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a RÃ ¼ ck@@ surface ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for calcul@@ ating the document of the document can be seen at least of this document . &amp; Kate ; offers the key to Ctr@@ l ; K with the entire line . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands here . under review the following commands are included :
remov@@ es a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description of respon@@ dents in paragraph .
it was already clear that the role played a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands under editing areas for one more simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
this command is spec@@ kled for the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly before the order to open the environment .
this command will be spec@@ kled at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the fly in the area .
if the c@@ ursor is before or within the commands \ \ Beg@@ in { surrounding } , it is inj@@ ected to the end of the environment ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when the input of many wor@@ shipped environmental commands can be lost quickly the sight . this command t@@ ack@@ eth the last modified environment , so that the environment was not dr@@ illed with the environment .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also special instructions for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Groups that are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . among Be@@ work Te@@ X group are some important orders that correspon@@ d to work environment .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the clamp .
this command will be spec@@ kled at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the sn@@ are @-@ lo@@ bst@@ er cl@@ amps .
if the c@@ ursor before or behind the failed Kl@@ ammer a &amp; tex ; group # is , the other end of the group is inj@@ ected ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
with the input of many dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ed groups @-@ cl@@ amps can be lost quickly the sp@@ read@@ able group . this command is the last modified group that the wor@@ th@@ under@@ ed structure of &amp; tex ; - groups not dec@@ eived .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple instructions for practical implementation is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two basic applications will be used . also for the end of the information is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two sch@@ ol@@ ding signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic plug @-@ in safety signs can be adjusted via Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X and can be switched off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ urse or french ) and therefore German or French counter@@ s . there are also many other languages supported .
when shi@@ fting Shift ; Regist@@ r@@ ter and k@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( eg@@ en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not just a row break@@ through but with the command \ \ item .
within a tables -@@ surrounding area al@@ k@@ ite &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an effective line of line breaks .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set and lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under settings ; set up to La@@ Te@@ X .
some users up@@ ward the columns in tables and distri@@ bute all Et C@@ characters ( amp ; ) apart from each other . although this tab@@ ulator is not the appropriate line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the appropriate , for the columns to the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; it has already been extended in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special instructions ( usually on &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , these modes are still installed . all these modes are available for different work on the following adjust@@ ments for different work@@ stations ... pay attention .
at the beginning of a new environment , using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surrounding } and it will automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
the last letter of the return button , the last letter of the input is removed and is generally consistent , so the list through input of a further letters can also be found .
all commands are written with a short description of its parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are included in the selection of a command . alternatively , you can easily be found in this positions by means of spra@@ y@@ ous jum@@ ps brand is possible and the un@@ wanted parameters will then be found .
under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; settings can be made to these lists . there are options for options for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as wh@@ ales of the general language bre@@ wed .
the command mode is for the absence of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ accompanied and the call of the ful@@ fill mode for a result . on the other hand , the environments will be so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the distribution of the environments .
when calling the link mode on the menu mode , the command is automatically adjusted and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in . afterwards , the ambient temperature is automatically adjusted , and it appears to keep the ambient temperature to the eas@@ iest way and termin@@ ated through Dr@@ Ã ¼ ck of the input button .
after this is completed , the environment will automatically shut down automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is still a lists of environment , it will even be a first \ \ item -@@ command .
under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings regarding these lists . this mode is used to provide the list of the complete list of the cancellation conditions for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ stand@@ able custom@@ ized lists of sections can be established on the following settings ... Contin@@ ue reading the file ex@@ ample@@ .c@@ ab in which the example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , for example , the letter L is entered and the word to ful@@ fill the menu mode for use or the key@@ pad Ctr@@ l + Alt no button , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large wh@@ ales are not helpful . however , it was found that many of them are written in a document more than once . thus , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete winding is already written .
this mode can be found in the menu of Settings ... c@@ ile cor@@ ruption . here , the threshold value can be specified . here , the threshold value can be specified .
the required files can be installed in Unter@@ ord@@ ner ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Apps / k@@ ile / l@@ mode / mode / of the Per@@ sian Home @-@ Ord@@ ner@@ .@@ mode is available for ab@@ bre@@ viation ( absence ) or tex .

PS files are not so known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . will be re@@ arranged the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools also arranged with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to re@@ tain the result of work experience , must be compiled into the source code . all the tools are group@@ ed into the menu of creating comp@@ ilation , ren@@ al converting and ren@@ al view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source @-@ text for viewer as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; or the other conversion can be used with Alt ; 3 times , via Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file converted into a PS file and can be converted to either Alt ; 5 to the PS file .
when using the command you want to comp@@ ile a viewer after comp@@ ilation . should no need to be used , so it will be a new window .
a new project is about the new project .... and the following information is asked for the project :
when the file names have to specify the relative path from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r -@@ project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the ID to EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scrip@@ ts can be administ@@ rated at the vertical bodies in the vertical body .
the API scrip@@ ts are not yet developed and can be found in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even in other versions .
as the first must be said that the expansion of the scrip@@ ts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system@@ atically object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite balanced system in which the basic functions are enlar@@ ged by a wide range of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aid to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . these include a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a perfect re@@ fern@@ al for &amp; tex ; and s@@ ein@@ e@@ â . this is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) , but rather it is ideal for searching for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since there is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; into three important Bookmark section .
due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the final of the right document offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the small application of tex@@ t@@ k , provided a database with all about &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and for a graph@@ ical surface surface .
all documents are divided into categories , and the most important advantage is the search for package names or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click on the mouse or the menu of the empty taste for the document .

often working on a project several persons in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship between each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be config@@ ured with Shift ; F7 project project Properties @-@ Di@@ alogue .
the name and Email entries are self ex@@ plan@@ atory . nickname , the nickname of user and serves for the unique identification .
a member can have several cast@@ ors in the project , like both team leader and Sub@@ project manager .
the user can try out of the list of the team members , who is going . this is done by taking the team member of the list and the button Set@@ ze as expressed as the current selected member ( their Iden@@ ti@@ eth ) appears after the following are : text .
nickname names and attitude of their own identity are important to news and notes . see for further information .
in addition to the overview of the team , there is a further advantage by the registration of the team : it can be created a event for information on the team leader when a bit determin@@ ated . see in for further information .
event @-@ actions are promot@@ ions , which will be executed when a bit certain in the project is done , as much someone worked , or the sending of a message , if a file is backed up , or a script that will play a file into CV@@ S , as soon as it is added to the project , etc .
on the site event configuration of Shift ; F7 project project settings dialog can be created , machined and deleted .
an email will be sent to the recei@@ vers list selected address data . address is a team or sub@@ project management . see in , we@@ i such lad@@ der can be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they di@@ ffer from normal comments by the following things :
NOTE that is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ item from the editor @-@ text menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary section followed by remarks .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , part of the project management Sub@@ project leader after the en@@ rich@@ est and Sub@@ project management should be led to the corresponding base or sub@@ project name , as in the examples below .
nickname names and Rolls @-@ names are independent of major or small , but spaces around the stap@@ les and the : make the note in@@ valid .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing , the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic is and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and sk@@ ri@@ pt@@ ors .
the settings are easily reachable on the settings . here , only via &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; - specific settings are treated , a short description of which can be found in .
the settings can be access@@ ed via Settings ... called Qu@@ anta . the dialog box extends over some pages that are succ@@ essi@@ v@@ ely treated .
the behavior of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including auto@@ cl@@ adding can be changed . the entries are :
large / small description of Tags : large / small sch@@ emes of automatically inserted tags . normal Great / Klein@@ sch@@ emes means , the Tags will be added as described in the day XML files .
large / small description of attri@@ butes : large / small description of attri@@ butes . normal Large / small description means that attri@@ butes will be added to the attri@@ butes such as they are described in the daily XML files .
optional Tags : if ange@@ h@@ act , is available for tags for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional Tags : as above for all other Tags except for simple tags .
start and end @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
autom@@ ating of acc@@ entu@@ ate characters : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ cent@@ u@@ ated characters in the respective enc@@ oding during the ti@@ pp@@ ens .
MIME type : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . using the default standard , the default value can be restored .
standard drawings : the coding of new created or in other way as a file open files ( where the coding of the file can be transmitted ) , but this setting will be expressed by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . this setting is expressed by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; created regularly secur@@ ing copies , so that the document can be restored by the next start of the program . this is not the same as the store of the file . also for un@@ stored documents , a backup is regularly created , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be represented either in editing area or its own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ il@@ age ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the source code simultaneously .
set the window settings on the default back to the next start is useful to change the user interface by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on views of the views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout instructions command parameter .
the warning messages are served as taxes of the possibility to dis@@ pose war@@ nings by an@@ alyst@@ s of non @-@ more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can also modify the display of symbols instead of scrip@@ ts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . regarding the different modes see .
here , the Par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in detail , can be dis@@ continued in detail .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change by cli@@ cking the mouse button on the mouse button .
in the structural tree settings , the vis@@ ibility of no@@ des can be opened automatically as deep in a change of structural tree automatically . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found in the current document no item was found .
the range for consoli@@ dation of ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations ( a type of tem@@ plates ) , which can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be divided for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ bre@@ viation is valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
this plug@@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug @-@ ins are used by third side , which can be used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the most famous &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ tion plug must be specified :
address : the path to plug@@ in if it is not at a standard location as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is delivered to the plug in the start , so it can open the current file to open the file ( path of the current file ) or the re@@ ord@@ ner file .
download in &quot; Just @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the Plugin is denied . only read @-@ read @-@ parts ref@@ use to ref@@ use the store if this option is not elected .
check the Plugin : is it activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the specified information is correct . choose the store of entries , even if the plug@@ in is not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely re@@ designed , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ugger . instead , the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ugger . instead of what was a deb@@ ugger plug@@ in concept that enables various implem@@ entations over plug .
currently only one Plugin available , the support for use &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserted .
the use of the deb@@ ugger for a project begins with the selection of a matching deb@@ ugger plug in the project settings . with the button options beside the Deb@@ ugger @-@ plug@@ in option , the specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ugger is activated , some additional elements appear in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ user interface :
a view that will be displayed in the contents of monitoring variables . usually , typically in the left Do@@ ck .
a view , where all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually in the lower do@@ ck .
a view that is shown in output ( like HTML ) of the de@@ bug . usually in the lower do@@ ck .
depending on the supported functions of de@@ bug , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to deb@@ ugger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in with , on de@@ bug requirements . this action is opened by default when a project is opened , that a deb@@ ugger that must not be used in normal fall .
the counter@@ part of de@@ bug session starts the session . includes the connection to Deb@@ ugger or completed the l@@ ute to requirements .
sen@@ ds a HTTP provider on the server to open a de@@ bug requirements . this is the same as the use of a Brow@@ s@@ ers to view the current document . the issue of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ugger issue .
the deb@@ ugger in dealing with the execution of the script and information about the super@@ vis@@ ing variables and the currently resulted in line . if this is done while the script is continued , the script was started when a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request .
shows the deb@@ ugger that will begin with the execution of the script and the current line number . if this is done while a script is given , the execution starts , when a de@@ bug is given , the execution begins once a request is placed .
the deb@@ ugger leads the next statement in the script , without going on into the functions or includes .
the deb@@ ugger leads the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes in fail @-@ adjusted .
the deb@@ ugger that go to over and go to the next way , when there was not the latest .
opens a dialogue in which a variable or expression can be added , monit@@ ored by monitoring , which will be monit@@ ored in the Vari@@ abl@@ en@@ view .
this dialog can be entered into a variable or a new value of a variable .

&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the day file and the tool . day file are hand@@ ful , sym@@ ori@@ ent@@ atives of images ( above the Ed@@ iti@@ er window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document , than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created ( see below ) , download or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on the conversion .
this document describes how the XML files are creating , then the &amp; induction rc file ; and also tool sets . shortly , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attri@@ butes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ alog@@ y ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool sets allow a fast inser@@ tion tags in a document without danger of a writing .
day file are nothing as a folder . you contain only the &amp; induction rc file ; and the daily XML files . day file carry the name of the writ@@ ings language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below list@@ ings the elements of the daily XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use so many users using a better view and more information on the work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and bound@@ aries will be explained in simple ways .
this is the root element of a daily XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain any element type about himself .
the Tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the daily class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type beads . returns the name of the class , where this method is one . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ bute and the attri@@ butes within this Tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is intended by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Tag . this is a short element type element .
this item describes a attri@@ bute of a Tags . this element can only occur once for each attri@@ bute . additionally it contains the name and the type of attri@@ bute . additionally it contains additional tags that will describe how this attri@@ bute is to be displayed , etc ; This is a only element type element .
available source texts used for the attri@@ butes in the Day @-@ Edit@@ or@@ dialog and in the Attri@@ bute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ meth@@ od@@ enn@@ ame within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and meth@@ od@@ or names . the arg@@ uments that are handed over to the method . can be made empty or % daily name % , which means the name of the current Tags .
a box @-@ day that evalu@@ ates the elements of a list . can only be found for a attri@@ but@@ or of only once . it is a basic element type element .
specif@@ ies the position of the attri@@ butes of a tags within a dialog box . this day can only be found for each attri@@ bute in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ Tag ) . the element is empty .
is the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in dialogue . ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that can be found within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is a short element type .
there is a list of elements which end a day . this element is a short element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ Dek@@ lar@@ ation start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enc@@ oding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be washed and closed .
spaces do not influence anything but look up &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; wh@@ at@@ st@@ his &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would be dis@@ appear .
for chec@@ king the daily XML files , the tools can start up in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window window and check the X@@ ML@@ . to choose . a further dialog appears to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , check only when charging the daily XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following example for a family of 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ ename for this day XML file should be sch@@ em@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example for a functional family of 2 Tag@@ XML file . this file is described a &amp; PHP ; Over@@ loading function . the fil@@ ename of this day XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enc@@ oding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; ! DO@@ C@@ TYPE : &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; directed rc file ; -@@ file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be edited via D@@ TD Bear@@ ite D@@ TD settings ; for one of a list select &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; induction rc file ; with the following entries will be created :
&#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD @-@ indication . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname .
a action can be determined with the settings ... . click on New promotion for the same dialog :
this promotion is assigned to this promotion . click on the button of each user , a key cuts can be assigned ; with a result is the current key cuts .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and in the promotion , this text is inserted in the document on the current c@@ ursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful special type . with the help of this action can use external applications ( usually scrip@@ ts , but it is not limited ) that you can change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) , even the Schnell@@ start @-@ dialog or the various See ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s .
as a first thing , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are permitted , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ . this way temp@@ ted and quant@@ itative local script : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Apps / quant@@ um / scrip@@ ts in their path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable to be used in command line :
% f : we replaced the UR@@ L of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document names are removed .
% PID : is being replaced with the PID of the running &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the external script will be used .
the parameters of this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above test methods , a script input from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can be determined on the default input . in the evaluation input , what can be send to the default value . options are :
selected text : the selected section of document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only with this setting .
according to the input , the edition of the application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , on the default output file ; it can be given to the default output format , by the value of the selected text is specified :
if there are many tags in the market language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and con@@ figure your settings . select the settings .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory . press the New Action button@@ hole at the bottom end of the window starts the edit mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add the day to the matching tool bar .
complete all and if the day attri@@ butes and you are planning to plan your use , activ@@ ate the dialog &quot; day &quot; when available , that is possible to use a input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is the most important symbol of the symbol . who should have the action in conjunction with this icon ? re@@ placing it before we have difficulty .
for creating a symbol that the action will be better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; then choose from the &amp; menu ; , graphic further programs ( or where otherwise it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select edit size others .
please note that the created symbol is not only helps you know what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
in terms of that the day start , I decided to create a button @-@ button as a symbol . by using the green ( green becomes most likely to be interpre@@ ted , further interpre@@ ted ) , or should at least , a message to the user you can download , click here ; -@@ Tag can be found in the current document .
after the creation of symbol , it must be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with the settings ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and sel@@ ecting the desired action . next to the text box there is a button , press him .
choose the file , in which the stored icon is , select it and confirm the OK .
press the turn button and put them on other Tags , so there &apos;s still what else , or confirm your OK with OK .
supp@@ ose you want to compl@@ ement some common &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool@@ bar , or it should be divided this for better overview through some tr@@ in@@ ders can be divided into several groups . set the tool set to the tool@@ bar tool . make sure that the desired tool bar can be selected .
I want to choose the tr@@ acking ( right above ) for my tool bar . after the choice of element , to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
for example , I want to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar cannot believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button on the opposite to the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by Pro@@ b@@ ieren all symbols , to ensure that everything works .
secure in the right file . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right file . please adjust the tool bar ( n ) if a file is open ( s ) if a file is opened .
perhaps the chosen value extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ ati@@ fication language you like this chapter , as I describes a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; re@@ pos@@ itory if a man has done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create a non @-@ exist@@ ent documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ rc file . we need to handle the second part we will treat you here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # items in the main index of item , e.g. php@@ 42 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # 3 , tag@@ 2 , day@@ 1.@@ html day@@ 2 = day@@ 2.@@ html day@@ 3 = day@@ 2.@@ html day@@ 3 = day@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible parts of documentation in the document tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level elements of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = in@@ dex@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax .@@ html ...
NOTE the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that there are no known limit for the tree ( except by the t@@ ilt ) md@@ ash ; but try it out itself .
you know that the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent with the upper end of building view &amp; md@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not influence nothing but look at &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Resour@@ ces@@ hip files will be replaced .
the ingre@@ dient is the scope of the doc@@ rc file , which is to be displayed directly . by writing a &amp; PHP ; -@@ scrip@@ ts , documentation for the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ FE@@ TCH _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the list of text list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding lines .
a simple list of common language elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; and these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ rc simply save after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Apps / quant@@ a / doc for local or global use . then you create a folder as doc@@ rc and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that this well and it is valu@@ ed , send your doc@@ rc file using a description of important information , e.g. what documentation is used to use the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have been working with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scrip@@ ts , tem@@ plates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bars and folders in tem@@ plates and folders in the tem@@ plates and scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , of where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if our team needs to be correct , making it a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . therefore , the source of resources are guaranteed , both for our team as well as for later users .
at the upload your pas@@ sport are asked for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ si@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have completed several keys , you can stay out . in the dialogue New resource , the input must be filled out ( UR@@ L @-@ preview can remain empty ) and will start with click of OK .
the loading can be loaded up of the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar tool bar is highly loading , and in the context of files and folders in the tem@@ plates and scrip@@ ts tree .
after downlo@@ ading of resource , even before installation , investigated &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integr@@ ity of the resource stim@@ ulates the integr@@ ity and the resource . in case of problems , it can be returned to correctly . if the integr@@ ity was given , a message appears with the indication of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; because hundreds of day files in the day XML is necessary , there is the eas@@ iest way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD shop and conver@@ ts of a D@@ TD option . select the .@@ dt@@ d file containing the D@@ TD description that will be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Apps / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TYPE defin@@ itions set : the string set in ! DO@@ C@@ TYPE Tag as well as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTM@@ L4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d appears
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P according to the conversion : if enabled , produces &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; based on the conversion to the &amp; induction rc ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is some key concepts that do this to understand and full advantage of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter tries to give them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefits .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , loc@@ ally and projection . this differenti@@ ation is concerned with a range of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; stored in the common folder Cor@@ rection of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administ@@ rators different tool , actions and patterns in the global tree to secure , which are available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of Web@@ development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so it can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be done everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns can be specially arranged for the files of a certain project . all elements are filed in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the edit windows , the man@@ age@@ ous view , the map with information and the tool . please beat in , and for further information about these areas .
you can download the boxes with the right mouse button in order to obtain a text menu with the current document , like about the current , other or all cart@@ ons , re@@ loading or download of the document , jump to an output or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
just@@ if@@ ies in editing area lead to another context of documentation , such as basic processing step ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing under the mouse inter or open the file if the string measured under the mouse inter is called a file .
at the end of the ed@@ itors are the tool set of the Ed@@ itors . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars will be adjusted to the new features and thus connected user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to add one day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; you can find the data for this straight day , then you can add the data for this straight day ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields .
construction man@@ sion ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navig@@ ate in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navig@@ ate them to open them and strips . in the presentation with Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ it@@ res are available for files , project , patterns , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this view shows all the files in the project using legal mouse click . actions like Add , remov@@ ing , loading or del@@ eting of files from storage media can be carried out with which then displayed text menu .
another possibility of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of tem@@ plates . almost all can be a template : images , program parts , a whole web site &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities to open .
tem@@ plates can be divided into three categories , depending on which the connection it is used . global tem@@ plates are always available , local tem@@ plates just for the corresponding users and tem@@ plates are available only in the project . more information is available in the project .
here you can find information about the available script file . the concept of dra@@ ws in Global , Lok@@ al and project works here . by cli@@ cking with the left mouse button , you can download the available information on a script . about the rights is available , such as the script will start to work or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ click of element the c@@ ursor in document to the position of El@@ ement@@ es , is a list of command in terms of navigation and collection of the tree .
this tree appears among other construction projects . with it can change man@@ fast attri@@ butes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . this entry @-@ related entry system allows the change of all available attri@@ butes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; document can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes of boxes at the bottom end of the window , can be achieved above the use@@ able information : the news window and the problem window .
this board sel@@ ector shows information about any in Qu@@ anta running script . for example , the D@@ TD used the current document and all modifications to the D@@ TD .
this cart@@ il@@ age shows all the errors of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scrip@@ ts that are carried out , give all error reports ( such which gives ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . Show it on a symbol and you get the appropriate command . the chocolate set of the tool is the option to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to define .
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send an tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sen@@ ds the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; if they get a tool bar in an email , they can download these in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as any other backup and loading !
it is reasonable if you want to adap@@ t the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if you want to transfer the con@@ figure Sk@@ ri@@ pt . in order to get a complete list of all options , enter . / con@@ figure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here not executed here .
if you have trouble at the start of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin file . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PA@@ TH before her bin file is . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined with a wide range of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to work with an adjacent idea that would be an independent market @-@ up languages ? well , this would make him a absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; restricted , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now you can define it on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE can be .
well , to the above claim that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding effort of all &amp; k@@ de ; the idea is not only possible ? thanks to the &amp; de ; -@@ s@@ caff@@ old is not only all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so as they need it for their needs .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity for almost every task . due to self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scrip@@ ts and tool@@ bars , they can have to have any script syn@@ tax . ( more about it will find them in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and was developed quickly as well as mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quant@@ itative ; Plus is associated with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; connected . the original developer left the G@@ PL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the individual documentation is help with help : / quant@@ a ( either this UR@@ L in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / quant@@ a run ) .
&amp; quant@@ itative ; currently developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick release list of files you have opened . this list changes every time if you can open a file , which is not found on it , whereby the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and all files as tem@@ plates for the later usage . you should try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project management system , only one error reported .
converted from the Middle rack there , the special characters contained in &amp; HTML ; cap@@ tion , so that they are displayed correctly and not from the browser as a form@@ att@@ ing assignment .
convert the text from the inter@@ change in &amp; UR@@ L ; -@@ Sch@@ abor@@ tion , which is the correct way for inser@@ tion special characters and spaces in &amp; UR@@ L ; s . in the first line to the Inserted &amp; UR@@ L ; s in the An@@ ker day .
switches the block selection to or off . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift .
goes directly to a line number . that is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error reports available !
looking for a string or regular expression in selected list . a type gre@@ p or using GU@@ I and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
shows the news window to or not . that is the window , in which you see the display of scrip@@ ts and the deb@@ ugger .
align@@ ment and switching of the problem rep@@ orters at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main body . the problem rep@@ orter is activated , once you changes to the structural tree .
shows the symbols of the main window . this column allows you to set up an mouse click .
if you are using the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries of previous or neigh@@ bour , depending on the position of the C@@ urs@@ ors in the document .
Bookmark the other documents published in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
opens a exist@@ ent project from the hard@@ disk . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; - projects will be stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presented a dialog to the files into the current project . select the selected files will then cop@@ ied into the project directory .
through the project directory after new files that could be there . this enables to copy the graphics files into your project folder or a sub @-@ folders , and then add to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport technologies depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have more inputs / output module ( K@@ IO sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project man@@ ages . in chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; - Projects please explain the details .
loads a project tool bar . these are kept in project You / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu , if you have assigned this project .
a dialog to save your tool . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialogue to add a new tool bar . this will be created only the name . actions must be set to be added , or you will be asked if you are asked if you want to save the tool box .
remov@@ es a tool bar from the view@@ point . it does not be stored on the hard drive . if you don &apos;t have any tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
so , you can send their own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ team that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu point opens a new E@@ Mail message with the tool bar as attachment .
allows the loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where the others can access them . see in .
invite you &amp; D@@ TD to download or wh@@ os@@ som@@ eb@@ ody else has others and convert to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own label @-@ format .
loading / dis@@ cover@@ ies of the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is mean@@ ing@@ fully if the de@@ vi@@ ations made from &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is not present , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , loading .
this menu includes a list of tags that are loaded to currently loaded tools . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a menu of menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog , if there is one . this entry is available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific under@@ lines .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion tags . currently , it works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . Intelligent Insert means &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the inser@@ tion tool is denied when this day is res@@ ist to this place .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the above menu item . click on enabled . click on an active plug @-@ ins .
cho@@ oses the syn@@ tax rate mode for the current file . the list of available Herv@@ or@@ sch@@ em@@ ata depends on the makes ; -@@ version .
cho@@ oses the type of line identification . very useful if you know people using the other OS platforms for de@@ fle@@ ction . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syn@@ tax of the current document using selected &amp; D@@ TD by the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate change@@ over between the various types of user interface . due to some limit@@ ations in the K@@ DE libr@@ aries can only need or un@@ beautiful graphics . it is recommended that the default setting is , or the window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
additionally , this menu includes a entry menu for each open @-@ window window . with selection of entries , the corresponding window will be activated .
this purpose is the status of the status strip at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window to or from .
changes in this dialogue is affected any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; compliant ; -@@ Web@@ brow@@ s@@ ers .
the behavior of the ed@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ ers will create . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find one details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete items or what can add and change the line .
this should therefore produce an help according to the mouse button , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with each open source project , the developers can always need help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in the financial form , you will find the way here .
the fields are self ex@@ plan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top of the project called the entire direc@@ tories for the rest of the project . all these paths and author Information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when input of name is automatically filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small booking and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the machine address the machine that you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ ample@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you can use this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used , depending on the device &apos;s remote control might be necessary .
this is the file , where the tem@@ plates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tem@@ plates . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this file should be set rather than the standards .
this is the folder , in which the tool sets for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this file should be set rather than the standards .
this allows you to insert files from local file system to the project . it can be selected several files or whole file .
this setting is great if you have static web content you can download and change it . on ser@@ ver@@ side scrip@@ ts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) it must be different .
follow @-@ up , if files that are located somewhere in the main@@ file of the project , will not be bound . if a project is started on new , not an@@ hook .
with this option , all files and folders will be shown within the main track and you can take a precise selection of good@@ ness .
this shows a list of files in the file folder . you can select the desired files through adding or , through remov@@ ing the check@@ box , cl@@ amps of the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants includes three adjust@@ ments to simp@@ lif@@ y your work . these settings can be up@@ loading in the menu of the menu profile in the lower window profiles or with the Access@@ key Shift ; F7 be changed .
some settings are correspon@@ d to those in the project assistant and are described in described . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) that will be ig@@ no@@ red for projects under projects such as project ord@@ ner .
added option to the above , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view that will be loaded on opening of the project . can be read more about the proj@@ ections .
this allows you to select the desired deb@@ ugger . it is currently only G@@ ub@@ ed . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the deb@@ ugger plug@@ in can be set with the button options . in this case the trou@@ bles@@ hooting section is described .
in the window profiles , high charging profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a construction supervision for the content of the server for every profile , po@@ uring a own building management for every profile .
in the window Team configuration , project members can be added , modified or deleted a ma@@ iling list . see in details .
in the window event &apos;s event , you can change event action to change or delete these actions , change or er@@ ase . event actions are executed when an previously specified event , as the si@@ ege of a file . see in details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project was open . this behavior can &apos;t be influ@@ enced .
to open a different project , open project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar . the dialogue is open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved , if you want to store changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; modified files . same happens if you can download a new project .
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there , can be administ@@ rated the files in the current project .
folders be@@ have as well , but are missing the entries and open with the right mouse button menu :
here , several profiles can be found here . profile information about the site of the highly ad@@ joining files . see .
allows the removal of the current prof@@ ils . if only one profile is present , the button is bl@@ ind@@ ed to prevent the removal .
the password will keep in the core memory and can be forgotten in programmer . this option is useful if the most common high load of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the plate store -@@ option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog when you change your opinion before the upload .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) to be up@@ loaded on different servers . when editing or creation of a prof@@ ils , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server that will be cop@@ ied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the load . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO sl@@ aves from . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( loc@@ ally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . usually it must not be changed , except the network administ@@ rator does not work on the usual port .
depending on your att@@ ack@@ ets , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . do it stored on the plate , so that it cannot be read , but everyone with programming languages can easily be seen in the plain text .
a project view is only a set files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded into a project lots of views , i.e. by simple ex@@ cre@@ tion of view , several files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open@@ able files and tool .
views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool bar , accessible via Settings tool bar project tool bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own work .
as above mentioned above are tools in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best available via the menu tool@@ bars . use and add to the tool . the aspect of tool@@ bars will be treated down in the section Hin@@ ds of tool@@ bars .
the tool bar and symbols may be set either by using the context ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which the new action can be removed , tool@@ bar cutting or tool@@ bar , which can be displayed in the dialog , where you can be visible on this or other tool@@ bar .
through the call of the text &apos;s text to a action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , the entries will remove entries and action , are self ex@@ plan@@ atory .
the tool bar and promot@@ ions can be set up on them in the menu with the settings of the settings ... and settings are set aside .
tem@@ plates are in the essential document , code @-@ cal@@ opes and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used tem@@ plates , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system existing directory in the prec@@ eding tree . tem@@ plates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limit@@ ations that you see for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supplied with delivered conditions for their use . please read the conditions of any template before use .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file apart from text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary tem@@ plates are usually inserted into documents by lin@@ king ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples is found in the advance tree under global tem@@ plates . more information on tem@@ plates is available in stock .
documents can be created by each text document . on the basis of these tem@@ plates , new documents have been created . usually , a simple assembly for the purpose and organis@@ ing the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found under global tem@@ plates . see in for more information to the tem@@ plates tree .
this species is useful if not a new document based on an advantage but the same text area always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Per@@ l basis . some examples have to be found under global tem@@ plates . see in for more information to the tem@@ plates tree .
as the name says , these tem@@ plates are organized for all websites as tem@@ plates . they are organized a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a compressed tar archive . currently there is no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
create a document structure to Popular ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose the file as an entrance to the local template .
as soon as the happen , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project situation ) the situation is not visible in the project tree . look at the project tree under project management .
select text in your document and click on the file as a local / project template . alternatively , the option can easily be pul@@ led with pul@@ ling and lay up on the construction .
the creation of binary tem@@ plates is simple : the file can only be used in a system file . it can be used to create all file management functions such as goat and lay , or Insert on the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select in the file tree or in the project files , click on a folder to the right and secure the site template . by default , the project is secured , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
project suggest@@ ions allow a very precise approach . you can merge head@@ lines and foot@@ age or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design , processing files or associated with them . in addition , you can keep some things by tem@@ plates in projects very pro@@ found in the eye .
the advanced structure in the window tem@@ plates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Apps / quant@@ um / Tem@@ plates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Apps / quant@@ um / tem@@ plates . each of this file corresponds to one of four types of containers , as above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , select the right mouse button on the file and select the text @-@ menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or tem@@ plates . this selection is covered , as soon as usual attri@@ butes .
this is enabled by default and fits all apart from the role model in the plant . if a regular player would be disabled , except they would be explic@@ it@@ ly enabled . in case of a normal file , the Bl@@ ah would appear with something like text construction . if nothing appears , it is probably found in a regular ord@@ ner .
according to pre @-@ set or pre @-@ set text for tem@@ plates in this file . this may be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all tem@@ plates for a specific project and enables a special presentation with a special head@@ lines in a special head@@ lines with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , a text menu ( shown on view , right mouse button ) has a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste the tem@@ plates from a place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; and source code editor that can be reached via the menu tab . the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor appears . then you can edit the source code editor in which the result is visible in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code .
at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor to a document , the &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ ever from &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , it is not possible to change the source code editor . there is no plans to change this behavi@@ our@@ less .
the second mode works just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ izes in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is already active in this mode , this mode is already active , re@@ tri@@ gger the active c@@ ursor from a window to att@@ ach the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via synchron@@ ization by V@@ PL ; -@@ view , one can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set in addition to a click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be set to fast computer and a great Spanish for slow PC .
supp@@ ose , one wants to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the document properties in the work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will be created . this means the change of the hanging of the body . thus , you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allows the store of information about the document itself , e.g. whi@@ p elements for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressu@@ res of the contents below or removed . a click into the list allows the change of content , such as key words on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the contents -@@ column .
CSS rules are the new way to the design of a look of pages on the browser . you can list CSS rules on the list below list . a change over the list is exactly as with the Met@@ a elements . this is currently not supported by CSS rules .
it is possible to adjust the external CSS style template by using the file button and cho@@ oses the corresponding file .
the use of c@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text @-@ processing , because of them with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the c@@ ursor can works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by in@@ ti@@ ffs and can be deleted .
the tags of Tags will be done in the same way about the tool , as described in the source code editor , as if an An@@ ker day is not removed , e.g. if a An@@ ker day , surrounded by text , each other is necessary An@@ ker day .
some tool@@ bars like the tables assist@@ ent or the lists assist@@ ent are de@@ activated . they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; this release must be used in this release the tables or lists of tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for analysis of styles . in contrast to other programs , searching for specific elements are possible and the execution of the style template can be pursu@@ ed .

there are many graph@@ ical tools to Compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me tell me why I have written .
the merg@@ ing was very comp@@ lic@@ ated because one of the contributions had under@@ taken many changes simultaneously . another programm@@ ers had changed the same file in the same file . the result were numerous conflic@@ ts at merg@@ ing .
that was used by me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within this lines . and there was no not@@ ices on the digits , where the result of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be able to display differences within a row and changes to white signs . later , any number of more useful functions were added .
if you want to compare it fast text , copy it simply into the intermediate shelf and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made much work was the Compare and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way assem@@ bling is fully supported . this is useful if two persons are independent of each other in one piece and changes the original file . in this editor , you can even edit the result before . in this editor , you can even edit the result below . the image photo shows three Qu@@ ell files at the merg@@ ing :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you complete the Compare and merge complete file . this screen photo shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merg@@ ing :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and refle@@ ct to the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines just di@@ ffer in a certain number of white signs , you can see at a look at the summary of the page on the left side . ( no doctor more if the man changes the reverse )
if a file is equal , and the other diff@@ ers in a row , then shows the colour that file is different . red colour means that both files are different .
if all files have the same names , but in different folders , then you can simp@@ lif@@ y the fil@@ ament to write only the file names of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 -@@ o Ziel@@ ord@@ ner
the opening dialog enables the manual of file names to select the option of file browser ( file ... ) or the select one of the latest file from the opening list . you need to specify it in the next time . if you don &apos;t have to specify the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
if you select a file , you can choose to select a file , if you select a file , if you choose a file , for B and C but a file , then uses and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders .
when merg@@ ed crosses , the input field is active for target and can be processed . however , it is not necess@@ arily necessary to determine immediately a output file . you can also use this step later on the store .
the setup -@@ button opens a dialogue with settings . here you can specify options before you start with the info Compare action .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare all of a text , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the inter@@ change to the active comparison window . when comparison begins , you can &apos;t select any files , you can simply connect the dialogue with the break -@@ button .
you can also use a goat and pick you : draw a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him drop it over a comparison window .
which thought is behind ? sometimes it contains a file e.g. several similar functions . if you want to figure like these functions , it would need to create a relatively large effort . you would need to copy it into &amp; diff@@ 3 ; download and compare these relevant sections simply copy , insert and then compare .
NOTE : currently you can re@@ cover anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the f@@ ie@@ ds of text is supported in a compar@@ ative window .
warning : some edit the goat and lay out of text in another program as a cut and Insert ( instead of cop@@ ying and Insert ) . in such case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each word window , the info line contains the characters A , B or C , the file names and line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window is optional . ) Every way to rest for a file , leave the mouse a while on the line . then a small help window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . it has the colour blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , you can distingu@@ ish what file is different . ( color for conflic@@ ts in the settings ) , the default color is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is the next section ( merg@@ ing ) .
in addition to the text , the column is displayed . when differences were found , the column is displayed . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only relevant characters only in character strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare single cases relevant . )
the vertical line which separates the collapse of the text is interrup@@ ted by the digits , where the source file does not have lines . if the line breaks is activated , the line will show line on broken lines .
the result @-@ window ( under the comparison windows ) also has a info line with the in@@ scription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changes &#93; if you have the result it usually contains the text , but often contains it conflic@@ ts .
! ! ! to all conflic@@ ts are de@@ activated , the store is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( do you use the buttons to the next sol@@ dered / UN@@ GE@@ SOL@@ U@@ EN conflict in order to find the remaining conflic@@ ts . )
if only two compar@@ ative window can be used , each difference may be solved in the same time .
through a click with the left mouse button in one of the window , the first row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will never be visible . ( this group will not be visible in the beginning of the group otherwise . ) This group will be lifted up with the color background colour for current area and on the left appears a black beams .
sometimes , through the automatic transmission , or by manual facts , no further line will be in the case ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you can change your opinion , and perhaps there will be another source . this text appears either in the final stored file , even in a mark that you may copy and insert differ@@ ently .
the text &amp; lt ; coll@@ ation conditions ; however , appears in the intermediate shelf , when you copy such text from the results window . go careful with this function .
NOTE : if the sources chose the options to ign@@ ore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs .
this will navig@@ ate mainly with the picture channel and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the right side , side down , end , str@@ g @-@ beginning and sh@@ g @-@ end , as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ si@@ re @-@ column next to the vertical image download can also be used by hin@@ ts .
in the eye @-@ window , you can also use the other keys to edit buttons . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the entry mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary @-@ columns synchron@@ izes the view of all the window at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in section merge and the edited output module ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons to the current / first / last difference to the current / first / last difference ( Ctr@@ l @-@ image / Str@@ g @-@ up ) , for the next / pre@@ domin@@ ant conflic@@ ts , even after manual rec@@ eptions are still considered a conflict . therefore , between dissolved and UN@@ GE@@ SOL@@ U@@ TIONS have to be distingu@@ ished .
in order to copy the marking in the intermediate shelf , you need to copy the copy Speed button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l @-@ Insert ) . if this is activated , you &apos;ll need to copy it automatically into the meantime . be careful with this option , because you might require the contents of the intermediate shelf .
line of line will be stored according to the elev@@ ated operating system . UNIX variants use a line feed character \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line output of the source file not at , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
options and list of the latest files will be stored automatically and restored to the next start . ( menu setting un@@ gen@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
choose a let@@ tering with fixed width . ( in some systems , the dialog appears also available with variable width , you should not use this but not use . )
if you activ@@ ate this option , differences are displayed in short let@@ tering . if the chosen scrip@@ tures are not supported , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colours , some colors are not available in their pure form , but would be broken down . on these systems , the buttons will automatically match an un@@ folded colour .
if this option is activated , when the tab@@ ulator button is inserted into the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise a table character is inserted .
when entering or Return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , each selection will be cop@@ ied into the middle rack . the manual copy is in the middle shelf .
you can select whether line of line type you prefer to store . the default value is the general value on the operating system used .
when you are trying to find files &amp; diff@@ 3 ; first , all entirely identical lines can be ig@@ no@@ red during this stage . the second step can &apos;t be ig@@ no@@ red every row . in this step , white signs will not be ig@@ no@@ red . also when merg@@ ing white signs will not be ig@@ no@@ red .
some editing ( in some systems ) save a car reset &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then you could see files with different sizes on page @-@ side @-@ side comparison , but then you might have different dimensions in the page @-@ an page . however , if this option is enabled , however , this option must be disabled . during the coll@@ ision , this option must be disabled . this option is de@@ activated .
in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding character ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ig@@ no@@ red in the result , however , the differences are still displayed as white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs .
intensiv after smaller sub@@ divide . option is enabled in default setting . it is effective for comp@@ lic@@ ated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the Automatic @-@ jump mode , this setting will be shown , as long as the result of the selection , before the next UN@@ GE@@ SOL@@ U@@ TIONS will be dis@@ continued .
dis@@ sol@@ ves automatically all conflic@@ ts in white characters each . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white signs can be used in figures or comments , if the automatic selection should be ign@@ ore in numbers or comments , if the options are ig@@ no@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in chapter to Sc@@ anning folders and merge of a merg@@ ing . look for details under documentation on the directory and merge .
if a file is stored and is already an older version , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original version , if already one such password file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without any further backup .
fits the language of user interface . changing this option does not need to finish the current running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; finish and rest@@ art the change is active . ( this option is set to the K@@ DE version of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; because the language is stopped globally on the control centre . )
the following coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if one option activated this option , for all entries the upper setting is used .
on the selection fields for coding , a short notice that is to be modified to local code . ( this may not be changed here and has not an inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file code for source files . this is influ@@ enced how special characters can be treated and interpre@@ ted . since the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared with different coding and can be merg@@ ed .
if you have a file , you can define the coding of stor@@ ing a file .
if you define the processing volume , they could not work with your codec . ( e.g. , your files will be 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but the procedure command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
turn these to modify the changes of changes in white signs in text or review . ( NOTE : this applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ign@@ ore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you are three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a colour enc@@ oded side @-@ column . but sometimes , you may only see the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is still displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ si@@ re column with the necessary information .
sometimes you want to use the available space for long lines . don &apos;t just use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
the compar@@ ative window in the side by side or over@@ lap . this can be benef@@ ic@@ ial to display of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and cho@@ os@@ ing files to perform files . if you use only two files and use the fil@@ ename of the last source file as pre@@ set names for the output file . ( if this function is used to start the merg@@ ing file , then the name of the last used output file will be ret@@ ained . )
when reading a file , it becomes visible to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which means that function can be used to cut out parts or correc@@ ting the integration .
when reading a file , it is presented to this external command , then the output of command command is used only when using the command . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your requirements . each input line must have an corresponding issue line .
the thought to allow users more flexibility when using the di@@ ff results . however , an external program does not need to program , and most users want to program the good news . the good news is , that in most cases , or per@@ l are fully sufficient .
use this procedure command for line with the input in large letters : SED \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s . * \ \ &apos; in the Er@@ nam@@ ing character sets refers to the found text in the first cl@@ ause . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems apply some key words to include automatically records : SED \ \ _ BAR _ Log \ \ _ BAR _ he@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ he@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ he@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ he@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ he@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ he@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ he@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ is necessary because $ a special characters can mean and end of the line would mean .
while you have experim@@ enting with them , you might make it to understand and perhaps you like this regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the no@@ ign@@ ore of numbers are actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example for another pre@@ ference command for line @-@ equal suitable . one &apos;s / &#91; 012@@ 345@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ des character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hits will be replaced by nothing , so qu@@ asi .
sometimes you would like to perform several statements on once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ olon &apos; ; &apos; in order to split apart from each other . example :
instead of use , you can also use something different like e.g. per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / ON / Switch &apos; All that are required at per@@ l some details . where to \ \ \ ( and \ \ ) , it requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the specified &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
data according to the normal pre@@ processor @-@ processor for display and merge . furthermore , the other operations are only changing the data , which sees the line @-@ equal algorith@@ m .
NOTE : in rare cases if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the line of line pre@@ processor sets the output of the normal pre@@ processor @-@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but like every function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers must work in a file many files . from this reason , you can compare with &amp; diff@@ 3 ; complete file re@@ ital@@ ic and merg@@ ed together .
... makes a proposal to perform a proposal ; you can adjust the suggest@@ ion before the start ,
... can it be sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes to do without them ,
... leads selected actions either with all ( F7 key ) , or just with the selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) .
this is the Compare and merge of individual files very similar . you must open a file on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders will be merg@@ ed , then Ord@@ ner@@ 1 is used as a basis . if no target file is specified , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 as target file .
NOTE that only the folders will start automatically , not the merg@@ ing . to start the merg@@ ing , you must select the corresponding menu entry or the F7 key . ( further details follow . )
during the read of the folder , you informed a small news window over the current progress . if you start the scan of the file , only the files are listed until then compared .
if the scan of the file is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a listing window with the results on the left side , ...
any file and any file of the scan is found during the scan , click here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the folder Cor@@ rection is usually folded . you can click on the + / - click on the object or select the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu includes two functions of sub@@ direc@@ tories and all sub@@ direc@@ tories can be open to which you can open all the folder .
if you click on a file , the file comparison will start and appears to be a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name refle@@ cts the data type in the first file ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type in the other folder is different , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object . if the merg@@ ing is started automatically , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , the colours A / B / C are red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries are different .
folder as the same as the same as its overall content is identical . then , folder is the same color . in folder is the age un@@ considerably for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors refle@@ ct the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red is red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exists , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exists , delete the target , if it exists )
... b and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exists , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory dat@@ at@@ yp@@ es . as long as such def@@ ective objects exist , the merg@@ ing cannot be launched .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory dat@@ at@@ yp@@ es . as long as such def@@ ective objects exist , the merg@@ ing cannot be launched .
the mode for synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it@@ ites target is specified and if the option is synchron@@ ize , then cho@@ oses the calculation 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so they both files are identical . if for one record ...
... A and B exist , but not the same : merg@@ ing and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after the merge and diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
if two folders will be merg@@ ed and select the newer file for cop@@ ying files . if the files are different . if the files are different , but the date is the same date , but the date is identical .. c@@ eps such error cannot be fixed , cannot be launched .
during the coll@@ ision , a file named after the other uses , if the coll@@ ision was successful , and according to other messages , if the result is concluded , you should take a last review and see if the status is okay with order .
if applicable in the connection dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflic@@ ts . ( the column for dissolved conflic@@ ts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merg@@ ed ) .
you can select either the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or any entries at once . if you have chosen all the gathering actions ( also in all sub @-@ folders ) , you can start the merg@@ ing .
please note : if you don &apos;t have a target file , then it will be used in three @-@ folders mode C as target while two @-@ folders merg@@ es will be chosen as target and synchron@@ ize A and / or B as target .
if you have chosen a target file , please check if all entries may be displayed in the target file , also in the Ord@@ n@@ erst@@ one correction , there are some options to avoid by certain items . check these options to avoid un@@ belie@@ vable sur@@ prises :
to perform all entries : select direc@@ tories / continue in the directory &quot; menu or press F7 ( the key contrac@@ tion ) . in order to execute the current version : select the current version or press F6 .
if due to contra@@ dic@@ tory dat@@ at@@ yp@@ es are still in@@ valid assem@@ ble actions , a message appears that shows the faul@@ t@@ ely elements . you can select a valid promotion for them .
if you meet all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options run , sim@@ ulate and v@@ om@@ iting .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen to be done without any changes . you will receive a detailed list of all promot@@ ions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then take certain actions with all entries by . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together a single file ) , then opens a coll@@ ision window ( note the screen photo ) .
if you are finished with a file , select once again and press F7 . if you don &apos;t have saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then you will continue to continue its work with the next story .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , notify me of updates and detailed Status information . at the end of the list , you can try to transfer the cause of problem to try or the probl@@ ematic record . thus , you have the opportunity to select a different action for entry or problem , before you continue with the merge .
if some items have been assembled together , see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries are not taken together in the current session . even if the result was not saved , or not saved , these entries are regarded as er@@ le@@ pers . only if you change the assembly action , these entries are attributed to the merg@@ ing action .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that are displayed on the displayed pattern , are displayed several samples in the el@@ element . separate space holders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . file must not comply with this pattern .
files and folders that correspon@@ d to this pattern , are not shown in the element tree . it can be displayed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ olon ; as a sign . valid space holders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspon@@ d to this pattern , are not shown in the element tree . it can be displayed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ olon ; as a sign . valid space holders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ign@@ ore files that are ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S , and many author@@ ised files will be ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this file specified with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( please refer to info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems you have a Ver@@ itable attri@@ bute . in other file systems marked a file as hidden . this option can choose whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on .
links to Files : if the option is switched off , sym@@ bo@@ lic link is compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to show the links . this is de@@ activated by default .
links to folder , if the option is switched off , the links are treated like normal file and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that the link will be treated like normal file and re@@ plen@@ ished . a link to a folder would lead to a du@@ dl@@ os@@ schlei@@ fe and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; c@@ lash off . ) This option is switched off .
a complete analysis of any file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ tested , non @-@ white and white conflic@@ ts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower if it is applied to files , which does not contain any text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large file over a slow network , it may possibly faster than the change date and the file size . this option is to use a certain measure . please use this option in default setting .
similar to the amend@@ ment of date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered as the same as it is equal to , if cop@@ ying the change date . please use be@@ ware . this option is ab@@ id@@ ated in default .
activ@@ ate synchron@@ ize mode if two files are compared and no target file . in this mode the suggest@@ ions are so chosen , so the results are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting .
if there are differences , instead of cop@@ ing the cop@@ ying of the newer file as a action . ( this is sure that the other file is not changed also . ) This option is switched off in any case .
if a file or a file is renamed or deleted , then the original version is renamed and receives the original version with the .@@ original extension already exists , this without further backup is deleted , not only the merg@@ ing single files , not only the merg@@ ing file folder . this option is switched on .
normally , the folder extensions can be visible with the mouse button . if you don &apos;t want to move the window with the mouse , you can switch the window box in the window menu and switch via the switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer , a file simply by double @-@ click . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can use a single file as well as you can start your folder . if you use the result , the status will not be converted again , and the file will not run once again when you start the folder .
this status is still lost , if you have to read the directory : directory &quot; Menu : new !
K@@ DE supports network transpar@@ ency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this way to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open , which are on local or remote b@@ ills .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a file within a compressed archive with a local file .
a UR@@ L has other syn@@ tax as local files and folders . a few things you should notice :
a path may be relatively high . or .. . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ L@@ s , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the UR@@ L file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes on the server system , sometimes on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a short list of limit@@ ations :
or it can &apos;t be distingu@@ ished if a link shows a file or a file . then it is always adopted as a link target . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no possibility to work per@@ missions or change date . hence the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( notice the option of the size . ) ( This is only allowed to local files . )
the main purpose unit is currently available as a differences viewer in K@@ De@@ vel@@ op . K@@ De@@ vel@@ op will always start the built @-@ in differences viewer . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the text menu .
usually , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part file , it takes or k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files must exist at least one of the two files . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch will need to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can select a patch file and select from the text menu of preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work if any of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files has been changed since production of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it is only supported the Compare from two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the coll@@ ars or the info is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is Kom@@ pare ) there is already . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 has already shown that it can lead to the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I use G@@ PL programs already very long and have learned to have much learned into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who walked this way or pass him .
you haven &apos;t compiled the program from the sources and con@@ figure sk@@ ri@@ pt . in the default setting con@@ figure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . in the REA@@ DM@@ E file you can find information on this topic .
if only the number of white signs are different , these lines should be treated as identical ; if , however , only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not identical . if , lines , next to each other , this , is co@@ ined , this o@@ is .
the editor will need for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this important information is only lost , if the result is easily stored as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to design your own file format , which could save this information .
the effort has so far too large . you can re@@ produce a specific version of the select a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after the remove text is suddenly , no src directory ; published and the text can &apos;t be clear and the text can &apos;t be ext@@ ingu@@ ished . what does it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used many colors to high@@ ligh@@ ted sub @-@ distingu@@ ished . even more emph@@ asis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . do you use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the wild Wild Web . thanks !
to use all functions of &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
for information , as you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes will be available on htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile and install 3 ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are un@@ certain , you will find more details in the REA@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker , you should no problems when comp@@ ile . should not be difficulties , report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cutting ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt remov@@ es ) cop@@ ied into the selected text and ext@@ ingu@@ ishes the text from the intermediate shelf on the current c@@ urs@@ or@@ position or re@@ placing the current market .
only differences are shown : files that are identical in all files are not shown in folder , and therefore not in target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to update the folder with the function update . )
only entries are shown , the differences will also be cop@@ ied . if the target files are not already cop@@ ied in the target file , if the target file is not already changed , however , this option can be switched off in a later program version .
NOTE the buttons on the source with the select A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons on the end of the selected group ( if they are not already available ) , if the lines are already available , they will be back on the button on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a min@@ iv@@ or@@ schau of all virtual working areas . it is quite practi@@ cally to change the current programs on the working areas to change their size or to move it . this works both within a working area than also with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual working areas as well as the current applications . the applications can be selected and even on the desktop .
with the intermediate mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . moving , the movement is possible to be able to other working areas within a working area .
the text @-@ menu depends on which the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . however , the context of the text appears only the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries , maxim@@ ize , on work@@ space and extent . the commands will follow the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of work@@ space . it appears only when using an application .
k@@ icked up the application to select the selected virtual desktop . it appears only when using an application .
if the cruci@@ fix@@ tures can be marked , window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s can be post@@ pon@@ ed within the storage area and also to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is crossed , are displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual desktop areas .
en@@ abling this field can view the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working areas . is it along with name display , are provided with ordin@@ ation numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working area .
if this field is crossed , the background every working area is also displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; now . others are displayed on the empty working areas to allow their selection .
here is the view of the program windows . simply shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be known : Classic sets and k@@ p@@ ager ; like from P@@ ager applications in some other sigh@@ t@@ ages ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal line and per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular in a vertical series , which is very well suited for the representation of the working area .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager @-@ mini@@ ature range in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed into the size , the window as a symbols or with their content . it also runs outside the control bar .
click on the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent select switch @-@ switch ... lets the dialog appears .
at the moment it can &apos;t be changed in the dialog , but you can do this manual :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you have no write permission for the file , you have to apply to your system administ@@ rator . in this file , you must define the key wind@@ ow@@ transpar@@ ent@@ mode and this file values are :

&amp; like ; is a screen saver . you can read it with &amp; can ; one part of the screen . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designer and people with a visual ability . this documentation is intended to use a complete manual for the use of &amp; can be .
&amp; I like ; is a very powerful application that is constantly increased to new functions . it is optim@@ ised for use on powerful accounting .
if you are looking forward ; start a window as above . the main window of &amp; mag ; shows the enlar@@ ged area of the screen . the image that is shown in the magni@@ fication window , is an enlar@@ ged area of the screen and is called in the following option .
in the default setting up &amp; can be enlar@@ ged in the area around the mouse po@@ inter as a mobile Lu@@ pe . alternatively , you can choose to display an additional screen area in the enlar@@ gement window ( optional selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse button on the screen edge ( eg ; on the left edge of the edge ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse inter in the enlar@@ ged window , select the mouse inter . please note that is not able to recognize the mouse button . this is still not able to recognize the mouse button . this is always the default value ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse po@@ inter .
in the selection mode you can adjust the selection window to its own needs . you can shift it with the arrow and mouth buttons and change its size . this may be done by the following way :
move the mouse inter at the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fying machine . this is also with the arrow keys .
if you add the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can shift the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . NOTE that the upper left corner of the selection is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; I like ; poss@@ esses a lot of functions . you can copy the larger image directly to the printer , into a file , put into the intermediate shelf ( to insert it later in other applications ) , the picture turn and much more .
starts or stops the up@@ dating of the update . the stop@@ over of the update causes that the required CPU time is due to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , low , medium , high , very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will appear in a window .
&amp; can be used automatically your introduced short commands to store files , open@@ ings of a new window , print , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document again loading in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , en@@ large and smaller , etc .
you can also known as &amp; c@@ est@@ fier ; it can use a screenshot of screen . you can use a hole to view into a newspaper or a photo . this application is for various people of benefit : from research che@@ ur or artists up to Web@@ designer or vis@@ ually handic@@ apped .
the detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( specify either this UR@@ L in the address strip of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( rep@@ et@@ itive @-@ strain @-@ Inj@@ ury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click p@@ ains are prepared .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click on the same spot . it is meant to help people to make people using the rep@@ et@@ itive fuel Inj@@ ury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and every mouse click p@@ ains . moreover , it can em@@ ulate the goat with the mouse . this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ ool ; can pain also be caused by the cli@@ cking of the mouse , and helps to use the computer without pain . suffering from pain , you should try to work with the use of your computer , you should not happen to a doctor if this is not yet done .
in order to draw it even once again : even if &amp; mo@@ us@@ al ool ; pain helps that are caused by cli@@ cking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by the mouse to the mouse , and as for all ergonom@@ ic tools , the result can be very different for each other .
the use of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; monit@@ ored your mouse movement and leads a mouse click when you break the movement shortly .
is the intelligent translation is enabled , power &amp; mo@@ us@@ ool . move the mouse , waiting it until the end of the movement , before the ind@@ ul@@ ge of the mouse button is executed . the smart translation requires a little exercise , but you are re@@ conc@@ iled to them .
this sentence must be used after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; mo@@ us@@ ool ; a mouse click .
is smart translation is enabled , the time offset time is switched ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is stopped , after remov@@ ing the mouse button , before the mouse button is waiting again , if there is no evidence for mouse .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ ool ; it is now activated by mouse button . this function is activated , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . this moves are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es@@ .txt ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to move the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider there . there is an ar@@ bit@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler sound buffer that you turn to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is selected , it is selected and k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available in G@@ NO@@ ME or other window manufacturers please install the respective documentation , as you will start a program automatically .
sets all settings back to the values that were set to opening the dialog box . if you have already put the button in turn , the settings will be back on the status after the last drums .
best use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent translation should first be switched off . if you have re@@ conc@@ iled the automatic click here , you can see a smart translation .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first of first , you should make a mouse click without effect : click on the neutral ingredients of windows or on digits in browser window , which does not have link to un@@ certain reactions . you can par@@ ked the mouse to such places , until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is clean , you should clean your mouse . it is usually quite simple . the tri@@ ck is quite simple . the tri@@ ck is clean , but also the rolls that come with the mouse ball in touch .
first of all , you need to take the mouse ball . as this is done by mouse to mouse . it should be very clear when you see the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball &apos;s ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole , in which the ball was used . the dirt and contam@@ ination can be easily removed with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
in very rare situations breaks the operating system version of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; if you just started a shift in this case , it means that &amp; mo@@ us@@ ef@@ ool ; the operation doesn &apos;t finish anymore due to a lot of mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ ool ; use another window manager and one window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click here . by this , the status of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; set it and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; mo@@ us@@ ool ; still mouse cli@@ cks and set the c@@ ursor to another point .
work@@ around : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor &apos;s mouse , if you don &apos;t want to make sure that the mouse click on a neutral area . secure zones for mouse po@@ inter and eg ; the gray areas around the mouse control and menus .
I &apos;m trying to edit the smart translation , but I create it not to edit the text .
the intelligent translation is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can easily move on this way , if you want to move the mouse with ex@@ press@@ ly Mau@@ st@@ aste . but it will probably prepare it only once more problems . here are some advice about it :
use the smart translation not , if you just start the end of the text area instead , click the end of the text area a mouse click and keep the Um@@ sch@@ Alt @-@ button , while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and click the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . therefore , if &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is expressed a sound like a mouse click . later , you can easily use the intelligent translation can also use without the audi@@ ble mouse click without the audi@@ ble mouse click .
to use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window , it must be installed on most system the case .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers are equipped correctly .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ ool ; bet@@ ting the mouse button soon as soon as the mouse po@@ inter is very hard . this program was developed for people who suff@@ ers to the RS@@ I syndrome , and those who are emphas@@ ized the mouth of the mouth .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; can also be config@@ ured that there is a certain time waiting for a goat , before the mouse is loos@@ ed . in this way , the goat and dis@@ assem@@ bling can be carried out with the mouse .
a detailed user documentation can be set with help : / k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ( specify either this &amp; UR@@ L ; enter the address strip of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ) .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; it is a program with the silent user to allow their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; the user can choose the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation sets , which should be spoken again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screenshot ) , enter the command that is used later for the voice output of text . further details will find in the description of the setup catalog .
on the second side , select the standard text @-@ pass@@ us text@@ book . from the text @-@ pass@@ ages you can choose text pass@@ ages without having to shed it without them . text pass@@ ages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right image photo ) determine the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ tic . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary , so that only correct words can be taken into the Wor@@ ter@@ ies .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is conf@@ id@@ ent and contains essenti@@ ally a intervention for the key field of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a continuous memory of the already healthy movements ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; you can enter right here , you can listen to the phr@@ ases that you want to listen . each whole set will be attached to the running memory . you can choose from out of the phr@@ ases , which should be spoken again .
with the Menu item k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two kart@@ ing cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ st Screen , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice services .
in the input field of the map voice , you give the command to call the voice of language generators . in the evaluation field , set the string , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; kn@@ ow@@ eth two types , add the text . select the check box when the text is taken on to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is given as a parameter . you can use the following space holders :
of course , on the order of the speech output of your speech generator . this command can be found in documentation on your speech generator . examples in the app@@ endix .
with possible kt@@ ts@@ d as language service is used and k@@ mouth ; as the first attemp@@ ts to ign@@ ore the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice services , and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is sen@@ sible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the initial evaluation promotion after sel@@ ecting a text passage , which action through the key contrac@@ tion or by cho@@ os@@ ing a text passage in the menu list , or in the glue for text pass@@ ag@@ les .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text may be spoken directly , and additionally added in the dis@@ continued storage . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text will initially be entered only in the input field .
with the second selection of the mach@@ ining centre for text @-@ pass@@ a@@ book , you can define whether the text @-@ pass@@ s should be stored in the closing of the processing unit automatically .
with the selection of text @-@ pass@@ able book , the book is saved . if you select changes , the text @-@ pass@@ a@@ book is not stored . choose from Save , will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the text pass@@ s should be stored .
the page Wor@@ st Screen Saver contains a list of words books for Wor@@ ter@@ field . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box contains more than one file . with this option , you can choose the currently used dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ tic .
with the buttons on the side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or adding them into a file . below the list you can set in input field and in the selection box for the dictionary .
choose for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation is simply determined by count of the assignment . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , to add only correct words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; seek what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merg@@ ed and how these weights are to be led .
with this option , you can create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically in the dictionary , create a dictionary in time with your voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
the main section of the window for processing of text pass@@ ag@@ gl@@ aries is divided into two . in the upper part , the text password are depic@@ ted as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can choose an selected entry . if you have chosen a text passage , you can choose the text passage or the associated key@@ pad . if you have chosen a text@@ pass@@ book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text pass@@ ages or books add or selected text pass@@ ages and books . can be either via sel@@ ecting the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or over a thr@@ ottle menu .
the order of text pass@@ ag@@ m@@ holes or text pass@@ ages you can change with the mouse to the new place or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button keys .
the chosen text will be cut out and cop@@ ied into the middle shelf . if in the entrance field , a text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of the store stores .
the chosen text is cop@@ ied into the inter@@ change . if in the entrance field , a text section is selected , otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the store stores .
the currently active pro@@ position is spoken . if this text is located in the entrance field , this is used to save the selected phr@@ ases of the event .
if this menu entry is crossed , one sliding tool bar is fitted with buttons on the processing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sch@@ ra@@ ff@@ ed left side and pul@@ ling , the tool bar can be post@@ pon@@ ed to another spot .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow strip in the lower part of the main window with regard to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not crossed , this status is bl@@ ind@@ ed .
this menu entry is crossed for text @-@ pass@@ ag@@ ings with entries . the vest is arranged by default on the processing window directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the sch@@ ra@@ ff@@ ed left side and pul@@ ling , the tool bar can be post@@ pon@@ ed to another spot .
probably you don &apos;t have the order for voice output not right or not complete . open settings k@@ mouth ; let us open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the map voice . ( see setup dialog for language synth@@ esizer . )
Festival is a speech output system of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ er are supported . license allowing it to use festival free and limit@@ ations without restri@@ ctions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , supp@@ ose that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command is then then :
Free@@ TTS is a well @-@ known language generator . currently , it only supports the English language language . the license allowing it to use Free@@ TTS for free and further restri@@ ctions .
in order to show an example for the device line for the setup of the speech output , it is believed to install Free@@ TTS in folder / usr / local / fre@@ etts . language edition is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example the option must be switched on . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ eme in a wav@@ ed@@ file , so you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / h@@ adi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would be glad to be the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added , so the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / h@@ adi@@ fax / / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; rm / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a row . this option must be switched on .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further speech service , which is available to all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being used in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
because the setting of the language generators in the K@@ TT@@ SD must only be used as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which is installed in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need to use a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that cannot speak with people who can &apos;t talk , text by the calcul@@ ator . it will be saved a list of the pro@@ claim phr@@ ases which can always be re@@ tri@@ eved again .
NOTE that &amp; cool , no language synth@@ esizer includes . on the machine must be installed a language synth@@ esizer .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - The voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of the module , which allows any application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( TTS ) . there is a common application interface for &amp; cold ; programmer , with which their applications can be equipped with TTS skills . even users can also offer interesting options .
Read texts ( or parts of them ) in text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Applications is embedded .
the speech output is performed via the program @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher , the different background program like es@@ peak , festival , etc .
allows the production of language spending on the command line ( or with shell scrip@@ ts ) via the &amp; q@@ bus ; -@@ manual program .
in ZU@@ TURE : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ SM@@ L ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice @-@ edition service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible window , the TTS services about &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
a application with &amp; GU@@ I ; for configuration and set of kt@@ ts@@ d via k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser and con@@ quer@@ or ; for the presentation of texts of a website or parts of them .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; can be read with the text file quite or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) find discussions about htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / lists info / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to install program @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher and properly set . see also
when the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr or as long as long as any speaker are furnished , the card card is displayed . see also if you have set at least one speaker , the card card is shown . see .
most TTS @-@ synth@@ esizer provide various languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such that is expressed in volume or speed . you should also use several variants for a synth@@ esizer . you should have at least one speaker , before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; as the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise used the standard price .
different speakers for the same synth@@ esizer are comparable to the same printer for the same printer .
if you click on the card cards in k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the card card is displayed . this appears also automatically when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and not yet any speaker .
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear in the list . the top nar@@ rator will be used for voice output if there is no speaker .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to remove the spokes@@ person from the list .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to move the nar@@ rator in the list on the list . the order of speakers in the list also determin@@ es its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
select one voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young girls and girls .
if you click here , it appears on the new speaker on the card card speaker . to edit the settings of this speaker , click on edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to map images and ver@@ ify whether the TTS @-@ service from &amp; k@@ de ; starts . now , you can read &amp; kt@@ ts ; use text orders to create text orders to create text@@ iles and manage . see .
if you have set at least one speaker , you can start the speech output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options .
marking the check box in order to activ@@ ate the business file ; the K@@ DE @-@ TTS @-@ service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is this start successfully , and you can read text orders and read text orders and read the TTS @-@ System from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue to activ@@ ate the field voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if the check box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr the template &apos;s system automatically appears in the system range of control bar , as soon as the approach is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , break , hold and record again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ intermediate rack can be read or a text file to open . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click on or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card player General and cross the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the shown website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you are read the text , read the text , and select the text edition . after short time you should start the speech output .
it is almost always sen@@ sible to mark the text of a website . you can also jump this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing and other invisible brands will also be read .
in &amp; Kate ; the enhanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read it text , check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs first if you read the text , and select the text , and select the language edition . then you should start the speech output .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Not@@ ify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can notify you about from you set aside events . you can read the text of this messages from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the text of this news .
in &amp; Con@@ versation ; , the IR@@ C programme of &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can try different types of news . you can claim a message if you proceed in a IR@@ C channel , in which your nickname . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can read out the IR@@ C news ext .

filter to character applications offer a good opportunity to correct but incor@@ rec@@ tly or def@@ ective messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , is a good example . it is removed the tags / local / In@@ box because of this in most cases it can be accepted as predicted . Read also .
filters are one of the advanced cap@@ abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with business days ; filter not necessary .
in Fil@@ ters , text is edited , before it is to replace the program @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for impro@@ ving the language to replace false spoken words or ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations to select a matching language and speaker , or to use certain mice of language synth@@ es@@ iz@@ ations and their voices .
to understand the working wise of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with an text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; diff@@ ers four types of texts .
the issue of Screen Spe@@ akers has moved the highest priority . it will be presented with all other orders . if the edition of the Screen reader is read , the continued orders will be continued .
warning has the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is getting hot . a warning has prec@@ eding and maint@@ ains the issue of news and normal text . these orders will continue to continue after the issue of the warning .
messages have the closest text priority . a message subject to normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application that can be used for a long text on a web site , you can access to the room with &amp; k@@ mouth . messages are also messages . Read the messages . Read all about this .
the rest are simple text orders . each contract that is used by the card ticket is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example for applications that have text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer text , who have no particular dram@@ atically .
all of the four order types will be shipped in waiting @-@ long , with the exception of the issue of Screen Spe@@ akers . if a use of a Screen @-@ reader uses , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such nar@@ rator , this output is adjusted and ended .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of Screen Spe@@ akers . they are applied to normal warning , messages , and text orders as well as &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter re@@ work the text and give him to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are as Mod@@ ules . in the future it can be used further types of filters .
character pins replace parts of a text by other text , which can be used either as words or as regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be used with pre@@ defined character using chat messages like : - ) by text or for the re@@ form@@ at@@ ment of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding .
&amp; XML ; -@@ converter use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Transfer ) by &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SLT files to translation &amp; X@@ HTML ; are included in SS@@ ML .
with speaking countries , you can dep@@ end on the content of text or dependent on the program that sent the text at &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE messages , you can read text by K@@ DE messages .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for a speech output . if the filter indicates that his rules will not appear on the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; sent by all the activated filter , it will be arranged by all the activated filter , which takes place on the side down below the filter in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of relevant normal filter . is a filter not crossed , it is not enabled and is not used . filter will be deduc@@ ted from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filters , and it will be shown below the following entry di@@ alog@@ ues .
for the setup of character sets , you have to enter a list of words or regular ex@@ pres@@ cription . if this pattern is found in the text , then the text is ex@@ changed to the associated entry text .
enter your filter a name . this name lets you choose any name , it must be di@@ ffer from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the character strings in the column match and replaced it in accordance with the string set out of the column . the list will be published in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to shift the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular ex@@ pressing from a file , the current list or er@@ ase . invite a list of file to the existing list .
here is a language , the filter is only used when the spokes@@ person for the text assignment is one of the registered languages . click here to select a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; Ctr@@ l ; button .
here is a value listed here , the filter is only used when the text is used by one of the stated applications . for example : con@@ vers@@ ational , k@@ mail
the applic@@ ations@@ ID displays you with the program q@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers must be removed . if for example &amp; q@@ bus ; the App@@ lic@@ ated ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 may only be cop@@ ied .
the character sets filters will only be applied on the text , if all the conditions associated with one record in the box of di@@ esen . are all input fields empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison of words the character sets filter regular ex@@ pres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. The words must be limited by divi@@ der characters ( spaces ) both sides .
in this manual , you can find no guide to write regular ex@@ pressing . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; press releases , you can call him in the di@@ alog@@ ues . editing &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ atory &amp; # 160 ; ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ ducer transmitted &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format in another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such de@@ form@@ ations . however , the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached on the ambient variable PA@@ TH , is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the female speaker filter you can be furnished to a certain spokes@@ person on the card card , or to a speaker with specific features . you can define a text by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before you can find a text to the filters , there is a speaker for the text . the spokes@@ person is selected for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker systems , which gives the text at &amp; kt@@ ts ; and the properties of the card @-@ card nar@@ rator can be selected . with the female speaker filter you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if the filter is used here , the filter is applied , if the text is applied on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ atory systems , you can call this with one click on the button to get help on the input .
to achieve a faster work@@ man@@ ship , you should try the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression of &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the characteristics of the desired speaker . if the text described above shown filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements at the eh@@ or@@ est . click on the button on the right to show the dialog .
use this buttons to store your speaker settings or load all the settings .
the female speaker filter will only be applied on the text , if all the conditions apply with a record in the box of di@@ esen filter , apply to at least a condition .
the Voice Edition @-@ API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer its applications TTS features can be communic@@ ated . applications communic@@ ate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synth@@ esizer to K@@ TT@@ SD must be added , so that this synth@@ esizer can be used .
the following section includes a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you can use .
open two &amp; console ; window window . start the window in a window , then c@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
no one of the above language synth@@ esizer supported my language . where can I get a synth@@ esizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ per@@ former@@ filter set , but when using the module for Festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.95 , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , that S@@ able to do it all . you need to use this voice not to read web pages . do you make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and above the ambient variable PA@@ TH .
certain sign or interaction signs seem to cause synth@@ esizer to cause the synth@@ esizer , so that the phr@@ ases could be issued , or just Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the option is set to the right value for the corresponding language . there are problems with specific characters or words , may be fixed by a string setting filter . see .

the list of the above @-@ mentioned language can be in@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . so they are therefore the description of the synth@@ esizer to the supported languages . look at the site of kt@@ ts ; for information that are not yet contained in this manual .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a adap@@ tive module architecture for language synth@@ esizer . if you like &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of another synth@@ esizer , you will set up with the development team in connection .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support for SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not necess@@ arily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the pack@@ ets k@@ deli@@ bs and the draft files for the &quot; &quot; dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text@@ archive for k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility or the each night , created Tar@@ ball , transl@@ ate and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first if all @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your speech synth@@ esizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ sk@@ ri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is used to be used for the program dis@@ pat@@ cher . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr should not be used directly , and the script will not be needed anymore .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual phr@@ ases . the user can add or decre@@ ed , repeat the output or canc@@ el .
if a application text is on &amp; kt@@ ts ; it can be used the features of the preferred speaking speaker . if you have created a spokes@@ person , whose language is English and whose family is female , otherwise , if you want to learn more about it , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; one person is chosen , see you in after .
if you click on the map case , click here to add one speaker to the list or click on to edit the card ticket actors . as an example , the card set of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . individual details on the modules can be found among the modules .
enter the path to the exec@@ ut@@ able festival program . if the path comes to festival in PA@@ TH , you &apos;ll need to enter the festival .
select the character codes for text , which is handed over to festival . for votes , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting will be made automatically . General applies to Western languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak , ISO 8859 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ der points you make noise level , microphone speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you don &apos;t select some reg@@ ler and displayed this grey , the chosen voice will not be displayed this settings .
some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ voices will need to mark multiple seconds due to their size . if you are loaded this check box , these votes will already be loaded into the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) of the first set faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have no speakers set ( or forget to click ) . see .
if the loop is marked by k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr the program window k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol can be visible in the system section , but not the program windows . click on the icon in the system section to display the program windows .
if the check box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr it doesn &apos;t work , it appears in the system area when K@@ TT@@ SD will be read a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD . therefore , you have the possibility to maintain it or on the other hand .
here are all orders in the waiting long , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of phr@@ ases and the just worked set . the nar@@ rator ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card .
using the buttons in this series , you can choose sat@@ a time in order , who should be selected in the list below . ( but not each order consists of several sent@@ ences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings will be taken over on the other cards ( also on the other card imprint ) , then click the symbol in the system section . click on this icon to display the program windows .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or code , click on the card card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and man@@ ages . issues of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ers , War@@ nings and News will not appear . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .

if G@@ stre@@ amer or code for the audio output can be used here , select the audio output . if no output modules are chosen in the list , you need to install at least one module , select AL@@ SA , select here the PCM device . see also
set the talk speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ kg ; % approximately the double normal talk speed . that these settings can be implemented , the program has to be installed .
click to apply for the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device is with you . in doubt choose standard .
in this cardboard box you can create special actions that are always executed when the text order from a message with the higher priority is interrup@@ ted . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders :
the issue of Screen Spe@@ akers has moved the highest priority . it will be presented with all other orders . after the issue of the Screen Reader was previously read , the continued orders will be res@@ umed .
warning lights have the closest news such as &amp; eg ; processor will be hot . a warning keeps the issue of news and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application that speaks news . if you can read &amp; eg ; just looking for a long text in a web site , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; just someone gre@@ et the room .
if a text order is interrup@@ ted by a message , warning or the issue of a Screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the waiting long .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrup@@ ted when both the conduc@@ tors are active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card is valid only for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and expenditure of Screen Saver there are no special actions if this is interrup@@ ted by a message with high priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ify ; K@@ Not@@ ify messages , start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click on al@@ erts .
marking the check box in order to upgrade the content of &amp; k@@ de ; devices are not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no not@@ if@@ ications before .
if this setting is marked , not@@ if@@ ications where a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read .
use this buttons to add or from it to a list . if you click on the button , a dialog appears to add the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the news before , the &amp; Con@@ versation ; sen@@ ds when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nickname .
all events that are not specified in the list , will be ig@@ no@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts ; are ig@@ no@@ red .
use this option to set what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event meets . you have the following selection :
if you choose a custom@@ ized text , enter the desired text . you can use the following space holders :
you can also enter the properties of the desired speaker system . default cho@@ oses the speaker , which is displayed in the list on card box spokes@@ person as the top entry . see also .
NOTE that there is three levels for events . is defined for a certain event in particular application , this is executed for all other events of the specific application . as the last possibility is the promotion to Tr@@ agen , which was specified in standard ( all other events ) .

use the door stor@@ ing to store the settings for the al@@ erts of a file . if you want to start with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click for extinc@@ tion . all entries except all files are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Synth@@ esis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for the control of voices , the talk speed , the volume of the voice and pitch . also brands for the control of ex@@ plan@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML are only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limit@@ ations are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( brit@@ ish male ) , as this is the default , the festival is used at the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or audio in the festival configuration dialog can not be set up to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually extremely mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and punc@@ tu@@ ation filters ( S@@ DB @-@ filter ) . SB@@ Ds may contain text in unique phr@@ ases . thus , you can &apos;t need to keep the whole text assignment . thus , you can also stop or stop or break , even if the language synth@@ esizer it not directly supported .
here you can see the pro@@ position of limit@@ ations filters . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be automatically established as a prec@@ ursor position filter . you can change the settings or further stat@@ ut@@ able filters , starting with them .
at the eas@@ iest way to try out the speaker run by try out . please check the speaker systems , change the speaker systems . if you have changed some features and check out how the selection of the speaker is changed , otherwise you have to have more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts you can start with the advance , since only the first set can be processed , and not the whole text block which can take very long ,
they then im@@ pressed text orders on card ticket or break , even if the language synth@@ esizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal movement border filters will be set automatically when you can start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it can &apos;t be switched off , just away . change nothing at that filter , it be , you know what you do .
punc@@ tu@@ ation filters from text with a regular expression of punc@@ tu@@ ation and add a table sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ position limit ( table sign will be automatically removed from the text ) . NOTE that the default position of the dis@@ position filter is attached automatically .
SB@@ D filter will never be applied to &amp; sound ; messages ( kn@@ ot@@ ify ) , war@@ nings , messages , or output by Screen Spe@@ akers .
for example , if you have removed the normal movement limit filter , you can download these back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; contained the default _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
in the card box , you can send the speaker settings for use . the card card is displayed if
use of the default phone ( the top on the card card ) . with other words , no female characteristics are specified .
use of the matching speaker , which contains all the properties of a furnished speaking speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker is out . otherwise , the speaker is derived from the most originally introduced properties .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the management of the network interfaces , the rout@@ ings and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enables the user management of a series of system and Des@@ k@@ top@@ Settings about a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center can be called via K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable the management of TCP / IP network settings in the same manner as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; creating a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . module network settings ( kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by sel@@ k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; menu .
it &apos;s important to understand that &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical appliances and their driver must already be installed and config@@ ured , thus &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; this device is depic@@ ted and the attitude of the network properties enables .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added with inst@@ al@@ eren of &amp; Linux ; with installed and set . networks later added , the driver supporting the following files must be charged according to the kernel version .
the module network settings will be re@@ charged if the option is selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when the module &apos;s network settings are trying to recognize the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the platform is offered in the list , which corresponds to the distribution and the re@@ eas@@ iness on the best . due to mark the setting , the settings can be met permanently . when the next start of the network settings will be automatically pre@@ set automatically .
changing the network settings are possible only in the system administ@@ rator mode . previously , all options can be seen , the settings can only be viewed , the change can be not possible . in the system administ@@ rator mode on the right at the right end of the module . it is the input of the password required .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three ri@@ ders :
the rider network interfaces are used to manage the network of the system . all available networks are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the adjust@@ ments to display network interfaces can be processed by sel@@ ecting the desired device in the list and click on the push of the button ... in the dialog device .
by default , basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button Show advanced settings shows the dialogue with advanced ways .
with the selection of the TCP / IP settings , the TCP / IP settings are supported by a DH@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server , all required TCP / IP information on each system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , no DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP can be performed in TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network is the sub@@ net@@ mask .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface at the boat . if the initi@@ alization cannot be desired , this option should not be activated .
in this dialog , values are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensu@@ red that the IP address in the network is not used to lead a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network should be asked .
if necessary , network equipment can be activated or switched off , depending on demand or switched off . one switched network is made by selection from the list and click on interface ....
if necessary , network appliances can be activated or switched off . switch off an active network device is made by sel@@ ecting the list and click on interface ....
specif@@ ies IP address of the b@@ ills in local sub@@ net , which regul@@ ates the physical connection to remote network and is used as standard TCP / IP communication with b@@ ills in other sub@@ net@@ worked .
when the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network , where the g@@ ateway module is selected .
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org is dis@@ sol@@ ves once again in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.90 .
the calcul@@ ator according to the nam@@ ing nam@@ ing resolution is a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , remov@@ es or changed online DNA entries by sel@@ ecting a entries and execution in the list with buttons and go down in the priority .
by cli@@ cking on the button ... from the group calcul@@ ator to nam@@ ing a DNS server . it will add a DNS server .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server , then click the button . next entry is then added in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to nam@@ ing a record and then click on the button .... It will be displayed in the dialog .
the list of known calcul@@ ator describes invo@@ ice @-@ to @-@ IP address mode for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it will be used in the first line when no DNA server is available . in small , closed network , it can replace DNA server .
normally , the list contains well @-@ known calcul@@ ator some entries to support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . this is still replaced in the test version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
specify the IP address of the well @-@ known machine and click on Add .... The Di@@ alogue New alias is now displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known invo@@ ice and add the button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several known as names , add one knob , and enter the other as name names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known invo@@ ice from the list and select edit ... The Di@@ alogue Cl@@ ay will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by OK , the list of the static host@@ s will be updated .
in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activ@@ ate the changes , must be set in one &amp; console ; the following command will be removed .
the homepage of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distribution ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient to install it , and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is just the rpm package downlo@@ ading and in one &amp; console ; with rpm such as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graph@@ ical surface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development stage with libr@@ aries and others are needed .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; kne@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should be done .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network systems will be discussed in the second , all of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files .
this range can not be re@@ placing the knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information on the PCs are used in a small ( home system ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated using TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . well , 5 has never been found large spread . by IPv6 , this description is concentrated in close future . this description is concentrated on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address of a network interface . in foreign network , on &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administ@@ rator to be al@@ located or if available , DH@@ CP can not be used . definitely , the IP address can not be chosen as any event !
at the setting of a own small ( home ) network of network should be selected for this purpose of reserves for this purpose , to avoid IP address data to the global ( Internet ) network , so the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the internet , so it is possible to use any possible use .
of course you can access the Internet for such machines due to a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , usually addresses are used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , net mask is usually set on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so all the computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route which requires the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = its own computer ) . the standard route is needed for IP further action .
the address address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in local own machine . usually the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file will sometimes be al@@ tered at DSL connections , so that it could not be sur@@ prised if in the case of active DSL connections , another contents are set to be specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is ass@@ orted by scrip@@ ts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand is expected as expected .

everything has gone round , the symbol for the tape drive , in order to indicate that the band was put into a corresponding message . the volume of the band can now be sear@@ chable . the volume of the band can now be searched for the band .
before the design of the band it must be solved , first the entry must be solved . there are three methods to do this .
&amp; dat ; available through a change of symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the tape and shows a corresponding message . the band can now be dis@@ card@@ ed without any danger .
before a band of &amp; dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; dat ;
a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this procedure is necessary to be form@@ at@@ ted before use before you can find out of the band from &amp; dat ; do not apply to flo@@ ppy disk plants . flo@@ ppy disk plants usually do not apply .

select a file or a file in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the belt movement . it is made only the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
marking the desired files from one of the archives with a leaf@@ lets . they are made only the so marked files and / or sub@@ file .
click on the right mouse button on a file or a file in one of the archives and choose to re@@ produce in the menu ....
once the rest@@ art@@ work was started , the dialog appears to restore . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the work for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue appears to re@@ produce . this dialog shows the progress of re@@ created , as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the belt file using the band inhal@@ er . this process trig@@ gered all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this is a f@@ uses profile with the straight marked files and the default settings . you can also use the following settings for the following settings :
the current work folder , which should be made in which the backup should be updated automatically , according to the chosen folder automatically .
for any file that are listed under backup files , that only the files can be backed up on the same file system , as specified in the file systems , you can apply separately under backup files . each entry is independent of tar independ@@ ently from the others .
conduct a continuous backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last ink@@ age file , a sn@@ ap@@ shot file will only be secured , which have changed since ever since .
the name of the file , which is used to determine changes have been used since the last ink@@ age source .
del@@ etes the sn@@ ap@@ shot file in front of tar . this means that all files will be backed up and a new sn@@ ap@@ shot file for the next backup is used .
the functionality of the kno@@ bs files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented for the time of this documentation .
the settings can be set via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can take :
the complete path to the device @-@ file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
this setting is active , transfers &amp; dat ; before the tape is bound to the drive . if some drives is necessary , it can be performed before reading or write operations .
this option is switched on , trying to un@@ lock it ; possibly this setting will not work at all tape drives .
if enabled , the option is switched on , when dis@@ solve the binding of &amp; dat ; automatically dis@@ card@@ ed the band . use this option not at flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; c@@ ate ; the hard@@ disk block size for tape drives . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must be &amp; c@@ ate ; in any case the block size for your tape drives .
if &amp; c@@ ate ; a band is form@@ at@@ ted , write it a file to the start of the band . this file should just stack a disk on the tape . the contents of the file is set up together :
( N byte ) The band ID . the format of this character is b@@ ail@@ ed : seconds , and the invo@@ ices of the system is form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the era has been form@@ at@@ ted in which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID will be used to find a file using the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ archives that can operate directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar -@@ versions should work , while there is not a incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the content of a secur@@ ing . this icon is only active when a band is bound .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Panel viewer for system prot@@ oc@@ olle . this program is not able to know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to perform the different protocol files . beyond that , you can upgrade the rapid access for example on information about problems which will appear on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps to understand your calcul@@ ator in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , which can not know where you can &apos;t know information about your system or where the system puts the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can provide fast access for example on information about problems which can be appe@@ aring on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore some advanced functions are able to be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , we have system@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sys@@ log server and sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition , and will be explained in the other chapters .
as you see in the following screen photo , provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with the help of a protocol file easily fil@@ tering and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , we try &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system prot@@ oc@@ log in which you can &apos;t start with system @-@ wal@@ ter@@ right . the protocol files will usually take advantage in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually have no auth@@ oriz@@ ation to read .
you can also use the filter strip to fil@@ tering a character set into the filter panel . in the default setting , the selection box contains the record line . in the default setting it will only be displayed , if in one of the columns , the string set of the filter search engine is included .
you can also select one other entry . the string set of the filter sear@@ ch@@ in will then choose the column process , and carry it out in the filter strip the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines should be sent , or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol lines of level errors will be displayed with a higher color images than the protocol @-@ lines of levels . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to view only certain process ( for example , in system prot@@ oc@@ oll or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can try to investig@@ ate the process identification ( PID ) in the column process , as for example , if you want to investig@@ ate the output of a certain command as the example of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you are using filter strip .
in addition , you can activ@@ ate the option to make new lines in the context of the main window to make all new upcoming protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files into separate windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open more window and manage . once you have selected a window on the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has a own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ s@@ oftw@@ are@@ .@@ org@@ . d@@ ort you will find more recent information about the access of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; find also in the following folder des &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following so named ) as &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; . this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v .
the V In@@ it develops quickly to the standard for control of the program running at the high drive system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and also more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ in@@ it .
I will not go further on historic aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know nothing more : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to do a machine on system V In@@ it , without a new installation and new format . that &apos;s why you need to ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one there .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it diff@@ ers also from BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub @-@ folders of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this file is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following other file :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scrip@@ ts . basic services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include no such items such as set@@ serial , which will only start at r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie between / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t need a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something to do something to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for various places after the programme in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the default run@@ level is listed in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point you can throw a look inside the second column and probably re@@ alize that the pre @-@ set run@@ level 3 is possible . if you want to change it / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab of hand , then you can repair all the system , then you come to rest@@ ing the system and execute the following :
but how do you start all the right scrip@@ ts ? if you enter -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;re probably something like the following :
you will notice that in this file is no real files . instead , every entry here is a link to one of the scrip@@ ts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
as starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scrip@@ ts is so written that there is a argument as starting and stop . you can start this scrip@@ ts actually from hand on the command line as follows :
this would read the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K comes stop called . if it incorpor@@ ates a S , the script will be called with the argument .
some people wish to create a simple type , machines for many purposes . I might have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ lap level , that can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . I may also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is easy to say tri@@ vi@@ al : simply draw one entry from the range of the available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or to stop ) .
you can change scrip@@ ts between run@@ le@@ vel@@ n post@@ p@@ one or the position within a level , leaving the entry of its original st@@ level ( or his position ) , but this is only going to pull out an entry from the range of dis@@ able system services .
NOTE : if you are post@@ pon@@ ed in a new range . to copy it only on a new run@@ level , you must select ex@@ press@@ ly cop@@ ying from the menu , or even in the target range -- even then , if the same entry is already in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of a updated can be not calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the remaining entries , before you can try to add the system service .
NOTE : at present there is no way to restore items , which were thrown into the paper bin . be careful so .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activ@@ ate the various work@@ areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the c@@ ursor keys to meet a selection of upper and below the previous .
to move a record in another round level , move it with cutting into the intermediate shelf ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with Insert ( with Ctr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a updated manual , press the button keys to switch between different fields . use the dialog button to accept the dialogue button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to ver@@ ify the changes .
because of the risk of data loss we require any confirmation in the menu file , before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ rc . default settings will be taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ rc ) . changes to the default settings are stored in a local ks@@ ys@@ v@@ rc file .
I have released the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine doesn &apos;t start . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default value to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be okay ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution &apos;s manual .
the type , such as system services in these distri@@ butions are , but does not comply with the configuration for propri@@ etary policy programs , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you &apos;re using a different distribution : check if all configuration files are available ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are just no news if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send us more about the run@@ level to this manual .
these documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . using this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; user , it &apos;s enough to read the chapter adjustment from &amp; user .
after you have done changes you have to save you . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or record storage in the menu .
&amp; user &apos;s ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two boxes , user and user troops . to edit , select the desired users or the desired group with double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog for User or group properties .
some map cards are represented only if you have extended system settings . only if you have limited adjust@@ ments ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , if you can pre @-@ use individual settings . additional card cards appear , if shadow -@@ pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xen .
the password ticket is appears if shadow -@@ pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xen .
this card card appears only if necessary for at least one can be activated ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , the limited restri@@ ctions can be changed in KB .
these parameters can be set individually adjusted for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the fil@@ esystem .
the map groups informed about the group corresponding to the user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , find in the field of Prim@@ itive Group . furthermore , the user can mark the user in other groups , by using this in the big field .
the dialog features a list of all users . to add one user to the group , marking this user in the list .
to add one user or a group , select from the menu user or group or click on the matching set of tool bar . the edit or del@@ eting of the selected users or the selected group works .
with this module , you can add the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ manager , remove the boot password , remove the time to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove operating systems , remove operating systems , change and more .
