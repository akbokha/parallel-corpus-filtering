<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files uses a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for one original or a derived photo.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also suggest the metadata store in the integration of metadata in & digikam. if you don't forget this, you can select the metadata from the database into the files by using the menu album the appropriate point.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what you want? do you make a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, as you start the real work, since you can select all images, select the same attribute, select all the images that will need the same attribute. this makes sense to focus on the best with the rating or leaderboard. this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best pictures.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now leave with jars, key words, as you continue with other programs often, or categories continue. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you have catalogued pictures from another source with built-in keyboards, then it is no problem to build the pictures on the right spot. the change of the hierarchy is no problem and can easily be replaced by using a sub-tree to another. the modified passwords are persecuted by & digikam; updated while the trees are persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows such as different metadata. this is a very rough reporter, since each block of metadata is composed of many sections. filename and calendar data features of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the passwords - the nearest section refers to labelling or comments, the third major tool to katize your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They want to see most of them all photos, you want to see them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are securely on how to get your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not yet a beautiful beach panoramic. if you see it closer, then catch some details to see, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you that this is the landing point of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing, associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may hear the silence. the labelling has completely changed this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others, consider the title might be more important than the image itself to create a interest. if you show images you should tell us a history. remember that the key is to help him the meaning that it moves to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a painting is not perfect if the strength has only work with a labelling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam; you can use any text in an international alphabet (UTF-8), as labelling. you can also export it to your wishes to your wishes to the label and / or the title of web-Galeriesystems. you must not tell the story for the opening ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system, the Earth was not a boring planet before Google Earth's Earth? good, because with pictures the train on the spatial presentation is now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities offered by Geolocation are already innumerable and can be able to open your travel through pictures with geographical data. & digikam. you can also show the photos at the recording location. you can also export the photos to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Earth view.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyrights is a word game with copyright and called the practice of copyright to remove limitations about the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also applicable in all changed versions, so also for the work of other.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is stored on the information page of & digikam; as information is required:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (Synonym for narrator and author): this field should be added to your name, or the name of the photographer, then it can't be changed the name of photographers, then it can't be changed. this field does not contain even Semikolons as a partition.</seg>
<seg id="173">The author (synonym for landmark): linked with the author. this field includes the name of photographers. examples: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent photographer. since this is a memorial to the author, this also has to be filled.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (Synonym for Contributor): use the Anbieterfeld to identify this photo. if the photographer wants to be listed here. if the picture is here, the image has been here, then the image has been here the image / agency offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright. everyone who has no protection against abuse. everyone who has any protection against abuse can be clear or modify. the solution for this problem is only digital watermark. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is one picture of the unique. & digikam; will be available in the near future for forklift processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: PLATTENFEHLER, plate relief printing, ECC, transmission error, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, deservance, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we're talking about CDs on the road or a fire. this type of rlusten are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, there are some problems with the so-called New media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data acquisition company in the world, has some interesting statistics which reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to tackle the problem with CDs / DVDs and you may have no more expensive than a few years. of course you can get CDs and DVDs in archiving quality. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe that is in your diarrative space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk to make good disks and good recording devices. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you're writing a lot of reliable. it is so far to choose the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very obsolete for error, even if you have just been written. therefore, the rest are only effective data, the rest we needed for the formatting and control towers. despite this massive protective cover, ultra-violet light, cratzer, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a reasonable program called IsoBuster that works on CDs and DVDs. it also runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications the corrupt data of damaged disks, hard drives, flashmedia, USB drive etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray disc appear to win the format pre-war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything was told, of course also for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burning the media with a good recording of high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. Read the media with a description, date & author license and afterwards protected the data on the next generation of media. don't forget to read the latest hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Flowing manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer encomes include a new disk, but not the data. Google lists a big field study about the error mechanisms of hard disks: floppy disadvantages</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: disks keep at the longest in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error correction, SMART can not set this error. some of SMART assaults this error. these are the expected lifetime of life. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only around the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also backed data loss due to one power if you have backed files, but these losses can easily produce no large problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most of the electric devices have not comprised lots of machines. these can cause severe damage. these can cause severe damage, hardware loss, destroying motherboards and other defects. protect themselves before the unavoidable up to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power tips is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in connector. however, it is usually possible to contain any overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for a overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure to protects the protection against flash or so that it protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a overvoltage each cable can use any cable, you should make sure that all peripherals can also be connected to your system. some manufacturers are also included to your modem. others offer connectivity options for your modem. others offer connectivity options for coaxial cables and the TV map.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these tools are especially developped for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for on the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection your system is stored in the power lines, it is not really help you in a complete case. even a failure of few seconds can result in the loss of infinite data. it can therefore be meaningful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection of overvoltages these devices will automatically make up your data. some models allow them to work up to the power. if you get a USV, you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements like a overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that you can be subjected to your RECHNERSYSTEM, and compare its safety with electricity, you can think for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you think. at the end you should always remember any cables just before you can ride in the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as a backup target for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular deal with any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are in comparison to the hard disks, however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send data about the comparatively durable Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore just as solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online. for $25 per year you can get unlimited storage that should not be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From sight of data backup are the web solutions very safe. transfer errors will be automatically adjusted and with the large companies, in the offer a backup and a reduced memory. so they are desasterable.</seg>
<seg id="202">The graph illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transfers are due to transmission errors. the file system will provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">This is the worst thing that nobody has occurred when it happened in your hardware. all these disruptions can't be found in your computer. nobody seems to have any protection. nobody seems to have thought that it seems to have thought on. the Internet with his TCP protocols is a significantly safe data road than the in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses, as they generate intereferencies within the data flow. they remain unnoticed that error.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently affected by transmission problems, you should look at the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of error per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can be able to be able with turnouts on low level and is available under one of the GPL-compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows is available. Read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still used in Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that is used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">This doesn't estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% for the workplace systems. for notebooks, the percentage of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the most important damage. it is currently limited to Microsoft systems. it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know only a few viruses and under & Linux; so long no longer exposed.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less obsolete for data loss as proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. a very good English articles found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file not completely stored before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the major cause for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 flashing settings of fundamental physical limits. the technology is that the technology is further developed for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in direction of the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end-quality optics are optimised for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full size sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive can be responsible for $100 & euro; so do you apply any other for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss. secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you can make something more dangerous such as the new installation of your operating system, exchange from discs or the size change of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash, if the drive is not connected, if the drive is not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster proposes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane: fire, water, electricity, children and throws are dangerous for your data. they are normally a whole room or whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">This means Desastervoram always means a not local storage. bring your fuses the stairs up to the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is a further advantage of the physical separation: as above already has been a common reason for a data loss in spite of securing the panic. if you use a backup is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete fuse: a complete backup of all files are to be secured. it is a moment of moments without history and represents a complete copy of a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete moments up to two times: the complete backup and the last differentials.</seg>
<seg id="222">Continuous backup: a backup of the files has been changed since the last backup. you can rebuild the original status in any time. this fuse comes to another backup system in the next with the exception that it is only sampled and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful tool which can easily be able to create your machines. in contrast to script files or other types of file transfered rsync only the difference of files that really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase safety above ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time you come up a whole daily version of the last 7-14 days, one weekly moments for each month. each additional thinner should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC files, retain XMP files, original keep, storage, scalability, media, refind pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">With this valuable pictures the next 40 year survive, that is approximately the period of you really interested in you, because they are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unforeseeable due to your nature, everything is predicted with intention and realize during the time. unfortunately, there is no other possibility as the current system is backward. ever less variations you have used in the past, so it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be based on the explanations in this document. use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to read your images, then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: anyway if you change your computer architecture, your storage and fuses technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change an system in its size. this means it is always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out of which you have put the scalability with the endeability and the range that you want to have a dedicated plate or partition. * nix systems such as & Linux; can copy this range and to produce a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record is recognized, but they don't end it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& value; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC & dollar; parted resize / dev / SDC & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; residue 2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of travagFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day is no software, you can read this yourself. this task will be easier for year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary format, which appears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard, but it can be reliable, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. this format is not so many as TIFF needed and a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a reliable compression salescalms (deflate). it is therefore possible to convert your pictures in this format. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital negatives format is a license-free and open resource image that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the needs of metadata. a handful camera system is now available now and we hope to use the competitors of Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, in order to replace the & quot; Extensible metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to create your data into one file itself. the file information is provided with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers go ahead of a original of your recording, mostly used in the raw file. however, there may be the metadata separately from the image file, and as mentioned above already is reasonable size. therefore, you should use DNG as containers and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports any compatible online metadata standards, providing a great range of operations and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI workshop, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and explanatory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures on the camera carrier, you can use this as a temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your repository. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive processing, you can use external programs again. if you work with & digikam; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut down under circumstances from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export it only in Webgalleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; get a description, as you can have photos that you can already have on your hard drive. the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; connect this with the calculator, on the camera on the display mode, and switch them one. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a ferous -indicator will be available on the lower end and the presentation of all photos on the camera. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file extensions for any file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera formations of each record. with the sidebars characteristics and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a updated or his metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and information information to be stored in the internally from the camera. a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded from your machine. NOTE that at some digital cameras not all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows internal metadata such as an Exif, manufacturer notation, GPS etc. this information are the same as at the metadata side bar from the main window of & digikam; or the picture processing. NOTE that this metadata is not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer, is the click on the button and then you will be deleted from their camera in one single album in & digikam;. downloading the photos will not be deleted if the pictures have been downloaded from a album before you can delete photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can choose only the desired using the standard selection method of & kde; select the button download and then chosen. the button is chosen as long as you have chosen some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this is an option of new image. these pictures have been added to now from & digikam; downloaded. in this case, the new pictures can be downloaded with a star in the feed table. if you download this option, of course only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you select the buttons stored or chosen file, a dialog appears to read the target album, where the list of existent albums, can be displayed as a regular file, displayed in the section of My albums, then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam; invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete these from the camera, you can delete the button Delete From once. if you want to delete the button Delete, you need to select this first and then deleting for extinction.</seg>
<seg id="260">NOTE that there are no way to have deleted photos, which you will be deleted from the camera. they should not be carefully inspect if the photos were successful in a & digikam; -album you should be clear from the camera. if you make the camera case you should make it more faster than the camera's camera because this is considerably faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos are often not especially interesting names. that may be converted to double filename in the same album. therefore, it can be meaningful, the date and time to integrate the file to integrate the file names.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and sealing conditions. if you use this latter option, automatically created a file per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options as the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos can be stored on the record in the section standard autonomy. if you select this option, the corresponding entries of the Exif information can be corrected in the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can corrected date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another date format as the default format, you can use prefix photo -% Y-% -% d% H:% M:% S. switch on the date and time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you have to use the option filename, you have the opportunity to change the file names in small booking. or in large booking if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digikam; for a photo is displayed below the name indicates that the camera will be stored in the preview. its settings can be stored and automatically use when you can open the camera table.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can all use information about the orientation of the camera to start accepting a automatic rotation during the process. not all cameras do this information. in the section icon Metadata you can read more details about the information that embedded your camera to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera is not enabled, it can switch & digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to switch off the button, use the door knob, and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is available on the date, at which the photo is available, it can be loaded on the image data. all pictures with the same date are loaded on the image data. all the cameras will be available in the same description. all the cameras are available in the section icon Meta data, you can easily put information on your camera to the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case, it stores & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, then select the button extension and select the option of date-based underside at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The simplest way photos from their computer on their camera is to download button. select the upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears in which you can choose to uploaded files. you can also select more than a file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After selecting the image selection, asks & digikam; you will be loaded up to the images. a file selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired file and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as common concept in this document. this is a position that is indicated in length and latitude. the determination of data can be performed by American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographer it can be interesting one picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses an airplane to kartografting. environmental planners, military, police, architectural bureros and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've got later, where the photo was done, you can open a look at another & digikam; if you want to locate the place of photos, it can simply define this aspect of the photos, it is good for the position of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to come the GPS data into the image? first, you should know that Exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrds and map referee. the question is in this fields? there are at least three ways to achieve these data files and image files with the KIPI module for geographical order (manual) and last about the manual input of well-known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has an GPS unit. but there is a few containing GPS receivers together. either as map module or via transmit the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. you must save this data in gpx format, as this is the only format is supported by the module to the geographical order.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data from images and from GPS. you can make the same below & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length and wide grave or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the foodstuds to be created for instance by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you as much control over his work flows as possible. there are many adjustments, select the behavior of & digikam; click on this settings. you can change in the menu dialog box. you can click on the symbols of the left on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">The action can be shown on embedded preview or picture processing. you are putting the default behavior of & digikam; fix when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the search dentity and urheberable data. these data will automatically be selected automatically in the corresponding IPTC data fields. also in a database synchronisation, these data are written in the IPTC fields.</seg>

<seg id="297">With the attitude from PNG files, you can reduce the size of PNG files. the only effect is that the image data is more time to compensate and unpacking. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. it means 1: low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF files you can switch the Deflate compression salesm for TIFF. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality, as the Deflate algorithm works freely.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the Unless JPEG-2000 files, you can select a loss free. even if you have written the loss of loss, the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. as this paragraph was not supported, but was not supported in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam; the image processing is only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast to manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal to sensitive lines in output. if you use this option, add this problem with minimal loss of details. this option creates a bit soft, eliminated the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. default is it a fixed colour balance, which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that prescripated pictures in four steps more details in the nickname. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-lights, so that the parts of your camera will be taking into the settings. using the setting of your camera, it creates some unusual results, since they can try out some parts of the missing information from the pointed tip.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try the lack of green and red. of course this is a question, how much colour or white you want.</seg>

<seg id="317">The input profiles should adjust to the camera table and model that you can use. not all profiles are contained in the same type. there are some such as Canon, which means no color tonmapping or gammacorrect correction. this means that you have to perform the color tonmapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate you like your image of a device. this is very useful before you can print it as your camera and some colors are therefore extremely satisfied, instead of your printer can rely on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is fairly obvious that colour profile for them is intended for the models. unfortunately, there is no table of cameras and profiled lines here. this response is unofficial:</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; for example. they are not part of your distribution. for more information about KIPI modules are available in section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the lower edge of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and below the tool bar to fast access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of the image processing can change your photos. no of the features will have the original photo, before you use file memory or custom buttons from the tool bar. NOTE that you can't have the original photo, as soon as you have stored the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image, before you can change it. this can be done with the storing file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not stored the photo, you can reproduce the original image, reproduce or the button "button reproduce in tool bar. you then lose any change that you have been conducted at the photo since the last salaries.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of the image processing can be easily done or restored. the last promotion can easily be able to recover editing and reconstruct rework from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this often, you should make the key shorter, Ctrl; -z to restore Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you want to press the & LMB; if you want to press points or reproduce button in the tool bar at a moment, you will select a text menu. if you select one of the menus, all the promotions are still restored or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start the image processing, you can move between photos in the same album or the same keyword in the tool bar, painting high, image below or the entries in the menu file. if you have changed the current photo, you will be asked if you want to back this.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can find in the photo, and zooming in the Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the menu-menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full-screen mode. if you do not want to use the Esc button. normally, if you do not want to change this in the settings dialog of & digikam; change it from the & digikam; do you see the section on the setup of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the actual picture, you can print in the menu file image and get the default & cool; pressure dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual pictures or whole movements. you need to select the images with the standard methods and from the menu album. if you follow the assistant, you need only to meet your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window is available at the right edge, which is important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available, without the navigation file, even in the image processing is available, if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking click on the same rider, the sidebar will appear or vanish in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the same file, you can enter the lettering with unlimited size or add. NOTE that all special characters are allowed to be copied to the EXIF- und IPTC- Fields, that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are marked according to 2000 characters and are converted to other signs. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should notice these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you come to you, use either the button to turn or switch easily into the next image, the labelling are stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the turn button, there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, it is always done if you have chosen a metadata settings the always is written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation shows a value schema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Search and sorting line. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or using the keyboard cutlets. to evaluate several pictures at the same time, select these out and use the text menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field of urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering of the keyword, the keyword and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digikam; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is adapted to the specified search password. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many passwords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief for the input of juniper in a picture series. if you have entered different passwords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Passwords can also be put through aigners of the respective check boxes in the tree. all keywords are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are chosen in the main view and you can select a keyword in the keyword, this is not only applied to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the section of the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword keyword filter is used to change the selection of the main window with their album, - Datum-, keyword and searches. if in addition, one or more keyword filter from the right side is used, only the cut-quantity of these two are displayed. all created passwords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also go to Tags and do. suppose you have chosen several pictures to make you with stichworlds. if the keyword exists, you can simply define it out of the right side bar and you'll ask if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter is selected on a few words. they were chosen with Strg + a, and then put a keyword from the right keyword to the selection and put there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes will be held at every start of the program. you can also be switched under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, it would have to be one or should be it, you can change this easily with a double-click on the text and change in the control range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, after which is sought in the database. this may be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operators that is a name or a string, which is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouped options, you need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button. the options see as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted & digikam; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you have a colour workflow workflow that have actually photographed from your camera or scanner with a colored workflow that you can print the colours on your monitor from your camera or scanner of the same, or that you print, or in the web which form them out of your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic on color administration comes, then you want to know what buttons must not want to make this tutorials. the sense of this tutorials. in addition, this tutorials will make you sufficient background information about colour management. in addition, you should make links with deeper information, make your own informal decisions, make your desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow can be carried out all six below, then you need to take colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the RGB color space. (further information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image spending is by e-mail or the web where the RGB of the de-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if so is so good works and life for all so easy, why should you use another colour space and make thoughts about colour spoolng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors are really shown below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors which we can see, the hufeisenins region, and the colours in the RGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour browsing, please visit Bruce Lindblooms side and click on info and then click on information About RGB Working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to do my monitor with my monitor, if I have decided to work only in the RGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB color space or not, you need to work your monitor. if you are working on a RGB of you, then you need to use your monitor on the RGB standard, you must use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five Automatic corrections to improve the picture in most cases. use it before you can try out a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, abusing, automation and contrast from the menu corrects automatically, automatic and contrast from your colours. they will have to experiment with these effects, to see what is best possible at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scalable for the whole image that the dark point black and the brightest point is so bright as possible without its color shady. this function is often a magic correction for pictures of the dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Aborted: this method Adjusting the lights of the colours of the selected image as it is possible. this means that the comparatively very good results achieved in improvement of the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only rubbing. it is a very powerful operation, which works either miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic-up: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. they determined the dark and bright limits and adjusted the red, green and blue channels on the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast ratio: this method provides the contrast and the luminance of the RGB values of a picture through the lowest and highest values on the maximum range and a rejiusting of all values between. this is only visible at selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance sheet is a bit limited to a colour space with 8-bit per colour. if you can occur at far from the original image. if you can carry out the white balance in the shell mode, which is working in 16-bit mode, so you will drop your ways to correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance salute by Pawel T. Jochbal. it is starting with the menu entry colours white balance of the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The feeder can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original image as well as the preview of target bilateral. if you want to see the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, then it is enough to click the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The target photos features a red markers. the luminance of the pients under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above will be a histogram, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful because, most pixels are very small luminance. with one button you choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will decide.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on the shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment lets you improve the attendance details of your photos or even down diment.</seg>
<seg id="401">Tightening with the above controls, you should use the color pipette Pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture shows selected color to calculate the color temperature of white balance. on this type, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can reset the white balance sheet with the default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The oversight Indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pient is shown.. you will display the combined income in white balance. this will be displayed in the preview as a pure indicator, and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons storing as and shop do exactly this. each setting of white balance you can save here with a text file and store later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knob default settings set all the filter values back to their standard values and the related neutral white balance. NOTE that even neutral settings can be displayed another photo as your original. if you have changed your original image.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the codiers per colour channel of the image. 8-bit coding is the wide spread JPEG format, 16 bit coding is better for high quality images. this coding are also required more turntables, calculating time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialogue as to edit pipes. it uses the change and assignment of colour profile. colour tonmapping can be carried out by the window for the helds. a detailed instructions for use of colour profile can be able to rate the chapter color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colors of audio correction. this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner must always do the same error and you can always need the same correction. in the manual for audio correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way of coating problems is to corrected the tool that you will find at the Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool Farbeffects provides you four colouring effects, a Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and a Canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect of the picture was completed, and afterwards the development of the picture was inverted. the result was a partially negative of the picture. this tool allows you to rectify this interesting effect of this tool.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity shows the image what chemical is possible. an additional increase is a negative image that is not created on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar power-effect. the original image is (1) and the arranged (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation that he has a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and glasting. try it, it simply embelleth many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the market name for a daylight colour film which is made by the Japanese company Fujifilm; and thus a reference for its smooth frame structure. Velvia offers very saturated in daylight. Velvias strongly of which colors are also some Photographers, especially those of which are hardly any landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neo-filter simulates Neonlight on the contrast. the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the slider repeat strength of the neo-lights. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras have frequently problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to experiment the different colour effects of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors. all your juices can be satisfied with the result. once you are satisfied with the result, you can use the knob Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can do a photo with bad light conditions, you can reduce the brightness of brightness and saturation a good choice for saturation. all changes you can try to see you in the preview. if him get the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool graduation and the simple leukstrength / contrast / gamma value, the tool is very complicated for improving the imaging. even if the dialog appears only the field of slider. concrete the three shooting down below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains an output of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or the selected area. under which, three sliding windows can be stored in the inside, and the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the control of the control, it is possible to move the control and change this picture as the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and the preview of the picture will be viewed as a preview of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box, whether the histogram is depicted with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a constant colour is often dominating the linear histogram of a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic setting is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three Shelves: the chief for the dark shades, the middle for bright tones, and the lowest for middle tones, often called Gammaids.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinboards can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the values of the shadow, medium and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection values for each area. there are also two controllers can be used in order to change the output values, for example, the output values can be used as background to create something different in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values apply automatically depending on the intensity setting of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: using these buttons can be stored in the file system and later again, Gimp levels is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three colour pipet, the input will automatically reuse for all shade, means and sun-oils, please click on the preview of the original image to set the values of the histogram of red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposed Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixel and indicate that the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator that you will get the effect only in preview and it's not a effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example for the alignment of input values used to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, the half of the original and the target is indicated. the preview can be updated in dependence on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel of the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this cheese there are two symbols between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures those with a digital camera, mostly the linear mode of a constant colour produces a wide beam. in this case it helps the logarithmic mode.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move a curator according to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that this bright tones can correspond with dark outputs, and add the related image and dark darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red markings on the area you want to change the original value, set the original value on this line and move your point on this line and move your value to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons can be exactly this. each curve can be stored in file system and later. the file format is that Gimp curvy format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you make this method and the three colour pipettes automatically, the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and sun. enable you to use the color photos for the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixel. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is a indicator that you will get the effect only in preview and it's not a effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black-white photo which was corrected in the Luminescort. Schatten- and sunny was used with the color ological and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-mixer of & digikam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels, or the colour shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel-mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour of the images. you can process it from the menu-channel-mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the paint for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can corrected the relative distribution and rash. the seat of the window indicates a preview of. the original can be viewed by their own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of target bilical features a red markers. if you are positioned in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram appears to indicate that the respective color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls are right down below: regulator for red, green and building allow you to mix this channels even if you can enable the appropriate color. this is especially convenient, since you can also enable the tool to generate great black-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black or white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you monmic, the reduction of colour is in a visible noise that looks from the color channel that looks different in the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern is different. if that the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion so you can reduce the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Stores as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any any blender setting you can store up and load. the format file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposed Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixel and indicate that the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator that you will get the effect only in preview and it's not a effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below, you can see a photo in which the blue channel was readjusted. the Luminanz Store is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the image detail (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was still fascinating due to your crash. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working steps, as colour images simply can be converted to the computer. also with a set of film rollment profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film transfer with a green Linsenic filter. this looks good at all the scene images and fits perfectly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to 004 Cokin (tm) Green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange film: simulates a black / white film transfer with a orange lens filters. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, like the 002 Cokin (tm) orange film.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film transfer with a red lens filters. this creates dramatic potent effects and can simulate Mondlimats for the daily time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film transfer with a yellow lens filters. this is the natural color one correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones throughout the shattage. this is very similar to the process of a printing and re-development in a sepia. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using & digikam; Tool texture can use decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of a color image or not, you can look like a oil painting on a screen, whom Stich of an old master, a pop style portrait from enlarged points or as a mural painting on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter block to the right increases the bond of depth, or three dimensional qualities on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textured is used on the picture below. the original image is (1) and modified (2). parameters relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Adding the & digikam; tool box can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an actuator in the boundaries of a photos is not a simple task. an opportunity to keep his attention. this is a psychological Barrier for scattering eye. under the picture frame, the module can start from the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired box type for your image. through an easy line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), abbreed with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttonhole and decoratively inserted a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of frame in percent. the value for the width is limited by 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the pressure of images, especially if you have used the tool after side ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily add one-format text in a picture of any place. this also takes you to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive. enter text and placing it with the mouse. use text exposure, orientation, colour from the colour space and the character set with its characteristics as you need to be the character set. for the end, simply choose a frame for the text and / or a semi-transparent background. this is the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text, can be changed to the button "OK. after the image once was stored, the text part of the picture. it can't be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Apply with the & digikam; tool Template may apply a template about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image stencil can be used in the image processing can be used to put on an image via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there is no restrictions on the size and orientation. you have to add the PNG file format and should you want to add it with maximum compression (9) to add it an e-mail in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-Users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you have to set your stencil file in the dialog. select the stencil files. these settings will be made for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root file for the templates, a building intention to reflects the ordinal correction of the stencil template. the option of a folder is being updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is enlarged the shown picture. it will be centered for the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Cladding this button in this button. it will be centered to the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template for the whole image, you must check the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to move the picture below the template. take this picture and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the template on your picture. the picture will then be adapted to automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; presents three different tools to boost the sharpening. each of you have pre-extracts in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpens is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates, particularly in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpens mask works on the contrast of the edges of the edges. actually, it is no bit, it works rather psychological Dunes and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three, since he really has improved the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalised images require a correction of the sharpness. this means that sharp edges can be printed with only minimized edges. the same phenomenon can normally be printed on paper. SLR cameras do normally require more afterwards sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera internal sharpening has been applied. pictures in the raw format, however, must always be poured in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner apply a sharpening filter already during the reading of the picture. if you enable this deactivate, you get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can usable results by using a photo with the sharpening tool. you can upgrade with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should be careful but because the results are not very natural: the sharpening of the edges, but also enhancing the noise. in general, it is necessary to upgrade the menu entry. you can reach more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite issue: a painting is cracked, it is considerably easier than it. use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry, and experimenting something with settings. the feeder opening on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter uncertainty is a very good tool to remove sanding from your photos. a demonstration can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help the image. the feeds shows the output of the Filters with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are frequently good results and should increase the effect. if you make the sharpen mask to be strong, smoking and impression of grats near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius makes a bit like many pixels on each side of an edge through the filters. high-resolution images allow bigger radios. they should be the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the promised image that will be added to the original. this means the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a break from the maximum RGB values and to apply difference amount. it can be determined by a minimum difference between the sounds of sharpening and therefore beauty errors in faces, Himmler and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example for the unsharp filter. the original image is the (1) and the image (2). unsharp masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool is focused on a picture through improving the sharpness. it used the urheberable discrimination filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; maintaining a picture of sharpens. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. this is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filing. it is usually achieved better results than unsharp mask. it can start from the menu by using colours refocus on picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular pressure is much better than the Gauß 'folding. the Gauß' ash has a very long tail, which is also affected by the original quest pixel, which is far influenced by the Gauß 'fverse in most cases even very strong from the remote-date results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the most important parameters for use this module. it is the most important parameters for use of this module. you can set a higher value if your image should be very unsharp, but then you should pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation can be reduced from 0-1. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. the correlation can be reduced to 0.5 and the values above 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the shark effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can be reduced by value of 0-1. however, values are less than 0.1 rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a good value is 0.03. a high value is still diluted.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß 'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß' s sharpness. in most cases you should use this value to 0 if you use a value zero, so you might have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Mat size: this value determines good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß '. NOTE that the module is very slowly if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The store and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any any reproduction parameters can be stored for later, and can then be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture on the other. the reason is that much operations changes the not immediately visible, but later to leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading pictures and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should use the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masked better results than sharpening. this might be caused by causing the unsharp mask a larger neighborhood more than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must create ineffortlessness. even under optimal conditions, it can never be the effect of acute filters. practical is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters always at least as well as the unsharpness mask. FIR Viennese filter is often better at the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small run-focused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image must be corrected. this image has been taken with an analogous camera. this image has been taken on insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods for sharpness correction in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator is set up the sharply of the single point to generate a natural pupid in order to produce a natural pupid.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinted enables a adapted color for the pupille. if you want to do blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove the desired Artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several presets as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail View p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass. a value of 0.9 should be higher, that no sharpening should be subsequently required. please note that the detailed report should always be requested.</seg>
<seg id="520">The alpha [0,100]: a small value of smoothly evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. JPEG Artefacts will be one of the best value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor via alles. p defines the relative smoothing. put this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameters for greater structures. if higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbullature effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is running out. usually 1 or 2 is gone.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular blades da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen, you should also create small angle for a long term. you should choose this value so much possible and for your needs acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrity stems distance [0,1, 10]: integrity stems in pixels. you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: this option can only be low due to quality of this option is only minimal. he doubled the term. we recommend him to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons storing as and shop do exactly this. each setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and can be reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors fixed is comparatively very fast at work. it can still take a very long and a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the push button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how image errors can be corrected with a photographic camera. as you can see it is an inexpensive black artefacts in the foreground that caused by a bad film in the foreground that caused by a bad film in the journey. the original image is (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; smoking is a very powerful tool to decrease Bildrauschen. it uses a urheberlegally protected Algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other Artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair to the lens, can be used to remove Sensorless of the camera or Moireacute; -Effects of collected images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you require further information about sensors of digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot of the image shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a gradient noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following cases you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you need only the window details and the window advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filters. large values increase the filter per pixel. by the radius changed over the picture and the color in it is smoothed and that smaller bug fixes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of sharpness. if it be increased, smoking changes will be deleted. if the value is too high, if you can change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details can not get more and noise or dirt.</seg>
<seg id="537">Kanters: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value increases the frequency response of the filtration. if it is too strong, can't occur the entire noise. put it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="538">Light density: controls the illuminance curves of the picture. we recommend to improve your image or luminance to improve an image. these settings will not affect the smoothing process due to the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the picture. we recommend to improve your image or luminance to improve an image. these settings will not affect the smoothing process due to the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark areas, which typically are stronger, however, it is polluted.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the alignment of Phasenjitterattenuation. this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of the lightening. if it is too high, the edges can occur. it can remove noise and phasenjitter to edges. it can remove noise levels and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are exactly used. all parameters to be set, which you can have set, can be stored in the file system and later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a painting is cracked for your purpose. the solution, image a bit soft, is fortunately much easier than a painting with the menu entry, and experiment with the gluten. the feeder opening on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo Restauration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to decrease photo archive.</seg>
<seg id="546">These filters for the restoration gives you the possibility of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to the Gauß 'cherries, film pieces, cratzer, compressive images and render out the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and lyrical resources. the algorithm is developed with another tool that is developed by the IMAGE Team of GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lost instrument of compression & quot; Artefacts & quot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this attitude is to corrected this problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons storing as and shop do exactly this. any setting of photo Restoration can be stored in a text file and can be reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. it can still take a very long and a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, the module can be used as a photo with equilibrita (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious pieces of films on the face. the original image is below (1) and correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example for the photo Restoration. this time, textures can be read on an old color photo that has been read with a scanner. the original image is shown below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; Toolbar is allowed to remove Hotpixel by photos that were able to remove a CCD camera with a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression is equipped with a built-in suppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark picture subtractive method. there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistants with the button Dark. the tool will recognise automatically the hot and bright pixels. these are lifted up in picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to discover the dark pattern directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels from CCD.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct image. please note that the assistant will attend the last dark image, and this will be automatically refresh in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you into the image of the result. the feeds shows the output of the felt with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted up in all the advantages.</seg>
<seg id="560">In order to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filters. choose the best filter method to interpolishing this pixel blocks. this are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirsty section: this is an average of the neighbour-pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all Pixies that have a distance of 1 from Pixelblock to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixel in bloc.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filing method. all pixel pitch is used to calculate a bi-square surfaces (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is used to interpolishing the pixels in bloc.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: every pixel with a distance of 3 or less are pulled to calculate a bi-cubical surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban Curves (1-dim) to interpolishing the defective pixel in bloc.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long imaging, applied. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. underlined corners, one image of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially in the medium sized and large photo format, frequently the entire sensor area cannot be evenly illuminated. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shady) they can reduce the light to the sensor. telephoto lenses are also reflected in circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="568">But also disadvantages. many Center filter require a factor of 1.5 or 2 while the Blender filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also use with Center filter, a hole of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise free effects of movement arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter, which is used without these filters. the tool has been used without these filters. the tool has been protected by a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the Vignetting-correct Correction Filter and with three further the exposure of the target bilateral.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the highest density at the highest density. the standard density is 2.0, which is due to a optical filter of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, designed to compensate the density by a greater degree of Vignetting to compensate it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchthickness, Contrast and gamma settings: the edit of a picture with the Vignetting correction is decreasing the illuminated thickness of the pixels. you must represent the exposure of target with these options only positive values, as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more sensitive restoring of the target image, then let the values for illuminance / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the Gradation from & digikam; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction is applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the illustration of the corners and (2) the corrected image has also been carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a urheberlegally protected Algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficients of the second degree is treated with the general geometric distortion of lens and may be corrected the concave or convex shape of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficients of the third degree has a similar circular impact, but it is applied to the edges. these correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficients trades corrected the distant corners opposite the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tonnenical distortions can be corrected and positive values of the distress distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value is controlled the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger than in the centre of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners have the link sign of the parameter' parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value is scalable the picture size and leads to a correction for the first degree. negative values enlarge while positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Refuse: this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the picture of the picture in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you the best filter settings, illustrated the dialogue with a preview of distortion structure. the values apply for your image, are stored and when the next start is used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnen- or cold-shaped correction should be performed before all the cutting edges or size changes. the best result will perform these correction than all the first through. if you have an image to cut and afterwards an tonnenical correction should be corrected the effect of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you the best correction to show you this tool a vertical and a horizontal support line. move it to a key location, like e.g. the sewing of the edge or a building wall to fix the lines at this point. in connection, you can corrected the tonnen- / cactress distortion using the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you corrected the resulting image, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu, cutting the image processing or via the zoom knob of this dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tonnenical correction came from the next logical step for some motifs like e.g. photos from the front, frame and paintings, it's the perspective into a picture 90 degrees. NOTE that if you keep the camera with the hand, you always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example for the tonnenical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website under this URL. filter reproduced the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option to simulate a highly sensitive film sequence. the ISO regulator is changing the amount of film pieces and the dominance of colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter channels can be mixed to produce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos, as the Farbinformations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared filies applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the image of the film was set on ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type Aura in the nickname.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & dignam; filter film gritt is a simple tool to produce films to your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed filters, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturer great silver grains of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film corruption gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move into the past life. if you want this special, gallery-artigen, road photographic, grainy view especially in your monochromen photos, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the control, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the body, though frequently higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, so you can turn the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film management efficiency on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an impressive protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil paintings are your digital images like a nice look like a oil painting. nature images and stylish are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regler to influence this effect. the upper part chooses the pinout size between one and five. thick brush are better for great pictures. smoothing the gluten, or out of the other side, the charity is considered.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and this is marked with (2). pinout size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter coal drawing uses colour and intensity gradient to create a Kohleskizze. they are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine, which scene must have selected yourself to skizzze. this would have been good pictures to start it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a value of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator is chooses the pin size and the bottom adjustable the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of coal directories. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adapting the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digikam; filter engraving the picture in 3-D, as if it was marked in wax. it uses a prosectional algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important at the contents. filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image in a gray, montory landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allowed it to set the contrast of filters. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example for the engraving filter. the original (1) and the image (2). the depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art of distortion effects. it uses urheberlegally protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Oil blocks 1: share the picture in cells and can look like it is considered whether it is turned through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Oil blocks 2: analogue to the wavy blocks 1 is distorted the picture here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculation and create a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art-visual effects. it uses urheberlegally protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom conclusions: the image along the ular lines run out of a centre. this is simulates a zoom-up camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radials unsharpness: impregnated the image by rotation of the pixel. this is simulates the unsharpness of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: impregnated the image around the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-sharply: the image by horizontal movements of pix. this is simulates the unsharpness of a linear moving, z: b: from a car or train photographs, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft tonight: impregnated the picture in the dark and strong in bright tones. this is ideal for creating a romantic portraits, glamour photos or add to add a warm and subtle incandescent lamps.</seg>
<seg id="620">Bulk solids: impregnated the image by random shifting of pixel and simulates the unsharpness of a very arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart unsharpness: finds the bullbasins in the picture and wiped them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and created, through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculation and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The regardrop are a nice small tool to make regardrop on your image. this gives it natural your pictures a great look. it uses a Pieter Voloshyn urheberlegally protected Algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows to change the size of the box. since the drip size isn't necessary to reduce the size of small pictures, the number and density of drops. Fischaugen changes the optical effect on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep using & digikam; image processing a range free of regardrop. use the range of tool to realize the area, e.g. a vision that will remain free to stay. if you don't start the Filter Regentrops, the range will remain free of regardrop.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regardrop Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and modified image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the picture depicts the wrong orientation, you can bring it through spans or threats to the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu of transforming or transforms.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blow is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to have a photo enlarge loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A painting is simple. the big question is, how can you find a picture, if the boundaries of the resolution is achieved? how can I find the missing information or errata? the CImg algorithm is used here, making it a good job. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size and choose to change the target values in menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool used to change the system used a linear interpolation method to adjust the pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow injection.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs are using a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge one image. & digikam; used a further developed approach. the extension of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France has been developed and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider Neue size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, the current size will keep the original size of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameters for greater structures. if higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons storing as and shop will be exactly used. each single phase for photo enlarge can be stored as text file and later on.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo blow is very fast when it makes it, but it can still take a very long and a high CPU load. you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo blow by using a small color display. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3) and the enlarged picture (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not just a common operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture with the mouse, simply create the mouse with the mouse, through press the mouse button and move the rectangle with mouse, then you'll move the mouse while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you leave the mouse button, the field of photos will be cut off. therefore, you can change the size of the right after cutting-to-cutting area by using the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting machine, use the button in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file memory or file memory under the menu file to store the newly designed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the presentation area, you can change the size of the rectangle with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In addition to aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or landscape format. in the large format, the larger value of the height and in the horizontal format of the width can be assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after side ratio is used a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal to whether you are centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to reach the selection, horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can set with the Max. base knob in the range for cutting, depending on the maximum ratio and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after side ratio add its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or Vertical). if you are stored in the image values, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data are attributed to the picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembling systems allow help to help you in order to put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third one, harmonious triangles is an opportunity to divide a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Middle: the golden center is a division established on various natural growth smells, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blasting leaves of a sunflower. it is possible in all possible things that we see as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden split in all times when you have used your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is located from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number is equal to 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that rule is followed as a visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquid support lines if you are set up in picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will make your target good results for your photos. compared to the third level, the Golden spiral line will follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and exhausted on this kind of symmetric visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is called the corner of the golden spiral, also called golden spiral. it should be something to create the eye of the composition. this can only be one line or different objects. this somewhat can be just as without the eye, it will carry out his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The gold triangles lead also from the above golden spiral. their failure are the middle-points of the golden frame. NOTE that in contrast to harmonic triangles, the triangles is no equalled triangles. Diagonal at this lines can be able to plazze an static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you need golden triangles using your frames, create a effect of professional Photographs dynamic symmetry: try your image capture and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition which can not reach you.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal and Vertical spans can be used to split the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the colour of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colours and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this kind you can adjust the colour of the lines your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to turn an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera. this creates a picture, in which the things are turned around an angle. you can repair this with the & digikam; image processing and tool-free rotation. choose the transform free rotation and justify the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the door, you can reset the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module free rotation is a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in picture show around the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now Adjusting the angle as in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image, you will find an unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is the function transform to use the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">A elegant way to add the image, is the feature automatic cutting. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">An option Anti-aliasing smoothed the image a bit after turning. keep the above warnings.</seg>
<seg id="668">All performers are carried out by a fixation of the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the centre of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to change the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically recomputed automatically. on the right side of the dialogue, you will find some information that help you help the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas formed by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas formed by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformulated area.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the right: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformulated area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformulated area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Right down: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformulated area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adapting the perspective the image is a bit dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small but two adjustments provide a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you will receive unpleasing triangular holes on the corners. one ability to make it a picture with transformation, cutting the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The mold tool is used to shift one part of the picture in one direction to move the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not distorated into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformation scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissing your image by using the horizontal angles and vertical angle. if you can press at default, the angle will look back to zero. a preview of effect will be displayed on you and the new dimensions of target image will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line ends. move the mouse to a key point, like e.g. the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the spreader tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the image, the image is a bit veritable. for a single note, this effect is usually negligible, but two deposits generated twice as much confiscence and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the refractory, the picture has an unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is the picture with transformation, cutting the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read image formats, therefore, in some cases, of the type such as these libraries have been compiluted. in most distribucks you will be able to work a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependency of other libraries, it is impossible to give it a list of all available file formats. but you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats. if the extension is listed in the list. if the extension in the list is listed, & digikam; file extensions can be displayed in the picture processing. you can change this list of file extensions on & digikam; do not accept any further information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos stored in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to use a detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression method on digital pictures. redundant information reduces the image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, shatters results as JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save a loss free when this is indicated in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the resource image format, you can read more than Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in colour. you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw Image Converter of & digikam; you can find more information about the use of modules with & digikam;.</seg>

<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can convert your in RAW format stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect the same results as the software from your camera distribution. sometimes you get the dcraw quality!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file, and start the module. the raw image converters window appears in mode for a single picture. with the button you can look at the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now redefine the values to optimize the camera settings, if the camera settings can be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as Gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can continue working on the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera is in RGB mode, the RGBG switch doesn't work effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview can choose one of the three output formats, and the filename will be equal and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lost algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, maintains all information of your image and uses the loss free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you want to use your pictures often, or later you should use the JPEG format, since it is just a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as memory format, metadata can be stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file into the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start button to start button. if you want to break down this process, you can break it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to one time. use this mode therefore, e.g. through testing on a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual pictures. however, this is helpful if these in an earlier experiment. a preview of this is not available in an earlier experiment. a preview can't be available at how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to convert all images in a record. it uses the program Convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>

<seg id="886">The OpenGL transfers into the presentation uses very elegant image Transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have an appropriate graphic card because otherwise the diaschau is very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option filename ensures that the file's filename is displayed in the left lower corner, while the presentation will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop ensures that the presentation in an Endless loop is displayed. you can break the manual with Esc; abomiting.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option added pictures ensures that the pictures in random order will be displayed in a random order. it is not the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Delay between the images can set the temporal distance between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transitional effect. you should be the first to show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. random with any transition between the images another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">While the Diaschau you can access a tool bar at the top left edge of the edge. move the mouse to this corner by you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start to the previous and stop the next picture and stop the fascau.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower screen edge, you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>

<seg id="915">The timeline can be interaktiv on the following ways: you can change the first picture of this date you can change the first picture of this date in preview of this date, and also shows the current date of the currently mentioned images, if you navigate to preview.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline, select the mouse button, and the mouse on the ruler of the timeline, so the time display will be displayed in the preview view only pictures of this period. you can break the selection by clicking on a beam bar strip.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photophotoalbum; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your pictures, integrated and the other as module (see). in the following part of user handbook is described in & photophotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create about the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you have to take some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and goal. in the following, each section is described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of overlooked and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photoalbum; HTML example pages see an example for this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, you will select whether a & photophotoalbum; -export file will be created on the review page. Read more about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Recently, you can select information on the HTML page. therefore, you can notice that all pictures of a party are obvious. for example, all pictures are exported. you can't use this setting to hide certain images from particular subject to certain photos.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define, as the HTML pages will look like. most of the settings are clearly, why not this is not specially developed.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below, you can adjust different resolutions for the images. therefore, those who want to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures can download the resolution of 1600x1200 resolution.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer on your site can change the resolution at any time. it can indicate your images with low resolution, as well as if a picture is larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, setting the different folders and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select all your HTML files for all your HTML files, and for each subsequent proposition a new subfile.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder, in which all your pictures are stored. this file is stored and when you select the coming pictures of the storage space. here you can choose either a folder or one from KDE supporting protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check this really all for viewer. if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL you should start here. otherwise, the web browser does not launch in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If you are not able to copy it in the final target file, you need to specify it to the final target file. this is not the final target of files. this is not the subfile of the current files, but the basic folder in which all sub-folders are.</seg>
<seg id="930">This is the just described setup possibilities for all three in basic folder, or URLs. in these, a sub-folders, whose name is set to set it in output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are interested in a family celebration, a meeting or somewhere else, with other users of & photophotoalbum; you can try to create a HTML page for viewing pictures, but if you add a lot of time, you need to add up and photophotoalbum, then you need to do with & photophotoalbum; this work is not even doing once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photophotoalbum; you can export a copy of your pictures in a .kim file. you can import a copy of your database with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in this file or if the pictures can be stored in the file, if you have all pictures together, and this file can be stored on the file, however, the file size is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim -file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the pictures that are located in the file of the .kim file. if you are not found in the file of the .kim file. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export file.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for export of pictures, which you can export over the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it is an internal or external .kim files. there are the following three options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you can copy a manual near the .kim file, you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">This option is copied into the vicinity of the .kim file, copy & photophotoalbum; the pictures automatically gives you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file is very small, but if you want to add it, then select the option rating file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is the maximum image size limits. if you send the pictures maybe not in full size, as the .kim file is otherwise very large. here you can say that each picture can be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file, select & photophotoalbum; the exporting database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to the importer consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures can be imported, then in which file the import should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you can be imported the category of people to imporating file (if you have a Dane), while this category can be imported into the third time window, which should be imported from the categories of imported file in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can set the categories from the file of your current database with the categories of your current database. an example here is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be just to browse pictures and look at: if you want pictures, you would like to watch pictures of your Italy vacation & mdash; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your boyfriend, you might want to see all the images that this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will select the different steps from (1) fixed the information about your pictures, about (2) the flow and view, until now (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has been started as a program to managing your pictures. however, it was extended and today take care of your videos. on many places in this manual we have spoken about pictures, but frequently bad this too.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photophotoalbum; stores all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal securing tools, copy to a disk or revisions in the CVS you can.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photophotoalbum; attend the folders, in which your pictures are stored again. if you wish to start another database in & photophotoalbum, so you can start a different folder with images, you can start & photophotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: photoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry of photophotoalbum; let you go to a window with which you can change the settings of & photophotoalbum; change the following section of user account will be explained in the following section of user manual.</seg>
<seg id="952">At the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call the preview of preview and options for the viewer. for any setting there is an exhaustive help you can call for a button on the F1 button and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In it has been described as you can create different features for each image, e.g. persons, places and Tags: you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Check the dialog, which is used to do already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a labelling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories, subdivisions were already mentioned. in dialogue, you can create full membership groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medium cards as stated.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the setup possibilities, you can select the list of the membership groups. with the above-listed selection list, you can choose the category of your choice. in the left window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of the subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photophotoalbum; share the module system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface. nourishing information please refer to the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called upon the menu modules. the modules can not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & photophotoalbum; are they are not sold separately. most modules have one help, but you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together for several applications, it may be able to test these modules with the demo database, before you can call this new modules first with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu. do not say, I'd have not warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules are connected via KIPI, are very different, so that some modules can work with & photophotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage, if you divide functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The greatest difference between & photophotoalbum; and other applications which are also using KIPI, is an album simple. also if & photophotoalbum; this type of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order to albums, so you can use the features & photophotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This is simulated & photophotoalbum; the current album that is just equal to the current view, so that all images showing you the picture of the picture shows.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & photophotoalbum; the modules also delivered a list of albums. here is & photophotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & photophotoalbum; s browsers the contents of a category shows, for example, each of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will have the category that you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums, for example, if you use the category people, it will be selected & photophotoalbum; so if you have selected persons to view and the module would be further improved.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photographic album; not compatible, you can remove these from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select in the modules, which modules are charged.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a starting screen, once you start & photophotoalbum; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you can find out of any other KDE application, see above a menu and a tool bar. under the toolbar you can see the window, where you don't have any information about your pictures, but now click on this window, now click here to show a glance with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photophotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with remarks, where the image has been taken either single or for a higher number of pictures simultaneously. if the picture is depicted on all images Jesper and all pictures were included in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for the search and browses as you can see in section. if you want to see these notes, if you want to use the integrated viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by using people, locations and keypasswords. these are a very important part of & photophotoalbum; because you can always use information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the translation of the pictures within the list: if you are depicted a family celebration and on all 50 pictures of the same 5-10 people, you can see that the names are shifted upward, those who can find faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer a Alphabetical product list, click on the symbol for sorting to date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you would like to work all the selected pictures and this pictures with notes. click on the front and back buttons that are under the preview of the picture at the top.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more comfortable all these pictures to mark and add the menu item more than once with an note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as overgroup. to indicate that it is an overgroup, a special symbol will appear.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context of the editorial notes of the remarks, it is possible to add one entry to a complete or subcategory or subcategory. NOTE that you can see this to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this is predict that you're right in alphabetical order. see this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the remarks, by clicking the edge, which form the upper part of the frame, click and move up from a frame, by using it outside the window mode.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, you can find with the settings, click on the button Options..., which offers you the option to store the current structure and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also make a frame completely hiding. if you want to see this window, use the button options... and then window will open a / fading. this procedure will see you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will receive an overview of presentations of selected pictures, or of all pictures you can see here. you can see the size of the presentation, by simple to bottom of the mouse with the medium mouse button, configure. try it simply times.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you make a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as background picture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on an image, this is displayed in picture viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can delete pictures from the picture show you can delete pictures from that you want to delete the corresponding pictures or select either the removing button or select either the menu button. now, you will see the window, which you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photophotoalbum; it can also be stored for this problem. you can also be stored on the hard drive. of course you have to store pictures anywhere you can be stored in the database Index. in the picture you can see the view of & photophotoalbum; if not all required pictures of the hard drive can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, where the right corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. this is illustrated by the pictures 1-9. however, you can display the preview of this pictures, however, you can't display these pictures with the image capture.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see this function you will find files from the folders and again put forward. & photophotoalbum; if you would not want to avoid the insertion of your pictures please, please buy a larger disk to save all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you can find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to make a little more privacy, you can easily make the images that you can see for others and click on current view into the menu. alternatively, you can also see all images that you can easily pick up your little sister except for the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So, you have set the images in the case of the Falles. if you have locked out the menu entry images, you can simply choose the menu entry images, which you have blocked, blinded. if you want to appear once again, click the back on sperm.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password, which must be entered into the images. to set this password, select password change in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture is very safe. if you can find all pictures on the hard disk and the other, each of which can read on the file index.xml, the password can only read it, those who are using & photophotoalbum; not very familiar, look at private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe all your pictures with & photophotoalbum; lasting and hours over hours that you want to look at any time. from this reason, & photographic album; about a picture _ and video viewer. this can be seen from the preview, as described in writing.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can be seen in view. it shows the picture, but additional information that you have to enter the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the Infobox in the upper part of the image that you can easily pull and what else can be displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. then you can see the text-text menu and you can see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are subject. if you click here the browser, see, right entries to this show. if you click on Anne Helene. as if you have selected pictures from the browser and then Anne Helene selected.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have several pictures in the viewer, you can use the keys for the first and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the text menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run these as a dip album. as frequently it can be a new picture. as frequently it can press the Ctrl button and Plus Minus, the diashau is launched by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the austerity of & photophotoalbum; can be used in full image mode. use the viewer button on the screen. do just use the input button to change full-mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer in the image, you can easily move a rectangle with the mouse button. with the Minus key, the Plus button lets you drawn up again in the centre of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the Zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the equation of the Zooms, so that each pixel complies on the screen a pixel screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">NOTE that the only Zoomoperations will work at videos that are coming and zooming with the Plus- and mint key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the text-menu, you can turn the image. this doesn't work with videos. you can also make notes to the current picture with the menu notes from the text menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures you can find a picture with one person whose name you will have to put on the picture. in the moment you can add and configuration dialog box. however, you will perhaps be careful to mark the image and look more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to get a printer to watch the images on paper. to see what photos you can start the viewer with the pictures and they would mark it as good or bad, while they see one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above gives you the possibility of features with features, while you see them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can reset the appropriate letters. see a picture where characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, you can see all pictures you want to work, print or whatever you've always selected, so you can use any module to copy the selected images to copy a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially characteristics can be displayed in the front view. if you can add photos in the view view, then you can press features the letters for the views, after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case allows you & photophotoalbum; on the picture to paint.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This painted is not stored with the image but in the database. on the way you can easily make your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">You can see a picture on the painted. to finish the painting mode from the painting menu. to finish the image paint on the painting menu. to end the image, you simply impressions the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you have to rule the application of the program & Povray; not completely rule, but documentation about & Povray; you should have read necessarily and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select some objects. then the properties found in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire-modular views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select several objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected lenses, as all subobjects already selected by the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To add a new object in the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object or select either on the icon or select an menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">There are multiply positions, the following foldable menu is blinded, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deletion either from the menu bar below ground or from the original mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed features, click navigate to apply these changes. if you have invalid values, a message with an error code, then you can click to enabling the input or changes with abomiting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to enter the Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the shown object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation contains not in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you work a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview of view-in view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on preview in the property view and a small example of the scene will be controlled with the selected texture. if you want to choose an order element in texture (for example, a texture within a texture Map and not the entire texture Map), cross locally locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Image photo shows the control points of the camera. you can pull this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross is marked the centre for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a viewable level model. you can specify this value relative to the visible lens or as absolute value. objects are only displayed, if they are selected or their visibility level, or equal to the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window orders as default. the object tree and view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graphical views right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like to know the default window orders or if you need another arrangement, you can also save any other window orders and change between various arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To tanked a window over or under one present view, draw the author for the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, draw the author for the right or left side of a view. the new view is tanked on the right or left side of this list and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to change several views over one another, draw the author in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views through clicking on the map sheet in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window subordinates are floating views: views, which are not in the main window. to solve one view from the anchoring, draw the pin to the desktop or click on the small following to the left above the visible arrow in the editor bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click the little cross in the prey bar. to prevent the closing, click the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views on the main window. in the menu view find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can verify it at any spot.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can store you with view window order... save a dialog, where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program needs to be installed. as this manual was written, was & Povray; 3.5. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click the symbol rendering the symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry view.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render-mode meets the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of renders. if you want to rendering a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can insert many Render modes, from a fast preview up to full screen in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render Settings in the toolbar or in the menu View, select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render-mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size, you can define the width and height of the rendered picture. if you want only a small area of the image, select the check section and give the picture section to the rendering form.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination of quality you can select the properties that used & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lights. an exhaustive description of render properties can be found in user's guide to & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture with only a beam of each pix is done, there are often different errors. these pictures have often displayed a Moirè pattern or stepping effects in curves and lines, sometimes you will not appear when it is smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of this mistake. generally, pictures with this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you enter Anti-aliasing, calculates and connects to Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technology is great sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the second method is adaptive to recursive; recursively because each pixel is always divided and adapted for the calculated color values by the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray is followed by the default value of pixels, then both pixels are calculated using the persecution of a specific number of pixels with super sampling. if you add the depth of 4x4 additional points, a grid value of 5 then 5x5 (25) add additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference is divided between the color values, then the pixels will be checked in 4 sub-pixel and can be checked out on further subdivision. the maximum depth of recruitsion can be adjusted by the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. when you can change Jittering, changing & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse lighting reflexion. it takes a very long to charge a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">In this cardboard box you can adjust whether the alpha channels can be calculated by POV-Ray. a pix is then transparent when the associated shays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpected, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene file, select the menu entry file... and choose the dialog window a file.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler is currently supported & povray; yet with the full command of & Povray; if when impacted error reports or warnings, shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support sources in & kpovmodeler, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawacin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can draw objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray; to export the source code in the editor file. to edit objects into the scene file, marking the source code in the editor and move it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and Insert in & kpovmodeler; and in your Editor, you can also add sources for & Povray; also included.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called, when & kpovmodeler; a scene is signposted. usually this povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help of the property, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the shown object. put here the path to your documents and version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; seek to external files (for example allocation data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you refer to files that are not in the file of the scene, you must also use the path to these files. if a file in different paths of the library is used, the first-folded file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for the display of the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle in the camera view and in the window type features.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the objects of the points to the grid-text menu of the wire model views. you can adjust the raster set separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Bigger values produce a precise wire model and thus a better approximation for products, require more time to render. for some objects, such as ball can set the detailed stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you have more detailed projections, all wire model views are further divided, all the camera uses an advanced projection screen. it gives a better approach for projections but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, one wall mounted behind objects. the wall is depicted in a chess pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a bottom is located below the objects. the floor is depicted in a chess pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross the edge of hot smoothing, the non-recursive non-recursive non-term method for the rendering of the scenes, you can adjust the values for depth and threshold. Read more to the parameters in section Render-Modi.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change the window manufacturers or create new window orders. in the section of window orders, as you can create window manufacturers and store.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination of default window manufacturers: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window regulation at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of pre-handhelds will show all existing window manufacturers. a new arrangement can be extracting with the button, and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below names shows all the views of the chosen window order. new views can set you with the door adding and selected views with the door knob.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with map card, you'll receive a card postcard together with the previous View and floating tankle the view is not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just now & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start any more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this manual, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among the beginnings are very popular: a sphere at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should read the following warnings, before you need to use it as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program, you should notice this important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set any camera, no rules can be applied for the pension as a result you can get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you have no light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any faultless installed, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. please read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable performance what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols now, therefore, you should have the menus and symbols, and their use.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you need to remove all objects from the object tree. generate the scene and then choose the menu entry for extinction. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene, which you generate. in particular, this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this is the scene from the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on the view of the view object properties, in which the different parameters of the camera will find. in user documentation about & Povray; you can find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera, but you can change the camera in view of control points, with which you can change the target point of camera. click on the left mouse button on a control point and draw him to the desired site.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you want to push the button or press Enter, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately accordingly to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you might set a Quader (Insert body quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a constant method for solution to this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; this is actually a simple possibility. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and press Enter. in the object there will be the new name immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, if also at the moment just as a limited level. when you rendering the scene, the level rises to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can see the object tree that you can see the entry for the floor. in this case you can see the different parameters of the object. in this case you can see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, allowing you to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Choose from the bottom to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but select a little bit multiple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog can be displayed in which you can select the object. please select the name in the property view. you can see the name in the property view (Name = bottom Pigment), with a click on the button. you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course the preview of pigments only shows a minor black material, because you can check the settings for the pigment. give you the colors of materials at any time. give it a lot of possibilities for the pigment. there is also many ways of possibilities, but you can now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't look in a preview of any colour on Quader and ball, click on the button, then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you renew your image now with a click on the symbol, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the colour code. you can also use further settings. in the Farbenlist you need two new attributes. then you can do this entry twice (you can also do more often, but the chess boards can only be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree or change the colours in the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be simply run, as you have already understood the general work of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties you can change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (don't forget the ball contact with the bottom. otherwise, the ball would be floating above the bottom, because you would need the bottom to bottom a unit below.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now makes a strange result: as previously shown above, the ball surface is like a bit of black material. put on a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now show a material now. as in the bottom, give the ball a pigment as a colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose first sub-object and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on Spice Pigment, select Single Fabrics and put the values like follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach an interesting effects, when you take the time, some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screens and click on enabling or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings are brightness effect and reflexion with some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metal is not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression that offers you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully you have already learned as much as you have to create beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a render method to generate a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene, or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracing, the render of hypothetic rays from the prospect of the subject (i.e. from the camera supporting the scenes) is reflected by objects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources will work out as fog mode. so, the scene will be processed for pixel pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you can see anything, the picture is simple. obviously, every scene needs to be ordered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files are usually the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set device tools. you can add with this option of toolbar for & kpovmodeler; add commands and remove them.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump map is one way to change hairy surfaces, without any beule on the surface individually modeling and without the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump map as well as a texture Map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometrical forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozen, or even hundreds of these principles. these models are then processed, to give them a realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is one way to give the surface of an object colour on pixel basis, by applying a image file as color chart.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, which is also available in other KDE programs. this section is made from six parts and should describe the DCOP functions, playlist, playlist, playlist, playlist, playlist and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function could be & zb; look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok still has some of its own command lines options.</seg>

<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, there is also other like 'shorten' or 'Monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available for these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, we lose information through data compression ever after their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG can now have a slight advantage of MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but more than these bitrate will produce less important because both codiers are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>

<seg id="1527">In connection with codiers programs, there are often a combination of programming settings for the codiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the codiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; adding to the keyboards (English: day) when MP3s has to be encoded with lame, the switch player from lame and the title parameter of & audio ocreator; added the result looks like that: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which the audio CDs can be read out in the calculator. it is written here only from text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal to be legal, but I am not attorney from the & CD; this is that public on the & CD; there is no more valuable, so, neither the artist is able to damage the music company damage. all information can be advised by a bummel through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; it is active a check box (Send of an address). for use of freedb, it seems to be used in the system. this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used for the server, but only the programmers know that the code is checked.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & copaudiocreator; for use of freedb, shall be used to be used as the nearest reflection server. this saves bandwidth on network and resembles the load between the bills.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror-vern for online Abruf by & CD; for information while exercising a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded, or (generally issued monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which is the readout program uses pieces of the & CD; store in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know, search in the source code.... This was already the best choice for the output of audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the selected WAV files, the codiers, and thus the desired file format will be selected. in the first openings for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a reliable compression for audio data). other codiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coater package must be installed by the running Linux distribution, before the codiers can be used. this is also possible for the predefined codiers. more information about Kodierer are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a codierers, further information can be obtained via the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a consolenwindow (eg; console). there must be 'lame' to be replaced by the name of the installed codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device of device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;), try to stop both programs with a command line in a terminal.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the case of & CD; this will not be happy!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use any other settings, this tips may be like to use.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will have enough information about to make those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, everything setup and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with an VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 juniors (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found as not totally free software. anyway, it's not necessary to compile the source files, what you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you have write permission to own (eg; trying to copy slightly in the conqueror anything).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & audiocreator;, something which is probably done only once.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the presentation of a & CD, which must be repeated for each item & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we provide to use codiers for compression of music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps), as well as the structure we are using to use the program to use the freedb to use the & CD; data from the Internet down.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change this settings at any time, we will probably do probably at any output of a & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is delivered to the selected program that the & CD; read data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device name of your running computer. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be connected to the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to the existing entries of the device drawings for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. here there is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be shown, as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only If uncomplete information, please select that you are notified when information is missing (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download on the internet of a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">NOTE: the calculator must be connected during the reading & CD; with the internet, that he can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, it is easier to read the & CD; that's with low risk name / file names or day entries, you can change it easily with the database and file names, they may be changed with consistencies - &gt; renaming and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter all manually, you can download the selection fields and freedb. however, these can be able to use this more than 620 MB, you must be selected this twice, at least the selected fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are the settings for the data-request, for the phone & CD; information from freedb servers on the Internet. how knows the system that get the CD? please read the section over freedb. put everything as in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database here, we want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to page freedb.org and look at a mirror server in your proximity. on this way the load is distributed between the bills. this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both will work similar to the server, as many fireworks the Protocol 8880 standard, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surfers on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want no & CD; data files on freedb server. it should be able to activate the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of the screenshot of screenshot. (make sure the file / tmp is exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously triggered pieces: excuse, there is a reason why any more than one at the same time in only one existing drive? paralleles and encode? the author knows it not, therefore try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this on to throw the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom file for temporary files: if you have access this, then it must be stored in which the WAV files are stored in which the files are not crossed in the private file, if you don't want to do files in the private file, if you do not want to do anything with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All such as it is on the screen photo. the command is something long, under circumstances must be fed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi system, the resulting bitrate is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">NOTE the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted if needed also. kidney 3 is an outstanding variables for the names of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use except this sample iels:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: at a dual core or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just finished the basic device of & audio-creator; this configuration is used as standard for each item of a & CD; if you have chosen the organization's structure of your music, you never need them to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, this section is described as the process of the readiness on the hard disk. we will create a connection to the music on the hard drive, because we are comfortable and the & CD; data from freedb will be able to recover the process of this section, must be repeated for each serving & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not contained in freedb, see the screens are a little different from as those for a & CD; they will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of them out of the internet. Comments will be displayed on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; this example happens. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet happen, the & CD has to be defined in the drive, defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length are listed in the window, as in the screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then search in section Questions and Answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked out by freedb, all the titles of the pieces were already filled and will also be displayed in the name of the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that it is more than a record in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there will be a window insert, and you can select the database entry that your opinion will fit for your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings can choose from the dialog for the settings), you can't have any local database, but require the data from the internet, you require the link to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: CD Editor's CD-data and the Titels of the First piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; accordingly to the model on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first row of the 'current title', the rest of data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist is not to be entered in the input field 'Current title', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower Commentary field can be used for the individual comments inidividuel per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments on all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful Abruf of the data from freedb is not empty, but it contains always a good idea to check the contents of the CD Editors, lest you begin with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words with big letters start or not...), but also to prove whether there is any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">NOTE: in this example, we use only ID3v1-tags. this is limited the length of the fields for the artists, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comments. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have an unlimited Feldlands. this option is set up on the tab card; let it take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the Tag version of the generated files later with the day editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see you in the help to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply choose one entry that is evident with the style of the unusual CD; it is not important because we don't want to talk about the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the selection of 'OK' you come back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors will be back and you see that the fields for the album has been filled with the specified data, which we have chosen for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. click the title of the piece in each case and others information that wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure the same way up to you all the title of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Please note: this window will not be downloaded, if you have downloaded data from the freedb. it is already written in one of these categories of database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. NOTE that the artist and the album can be displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">NOTE that there are a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected, or out, make sure that all the pieces should select one or out the button. select all the pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was launched by clicking on the button selection of the readable process, this window appears to confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the contracts and track what will become.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab to switch on the order window. it is on the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. this is just read on the hard drive. status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>

<seg id="1602">By the way, the file for the TMP file and the target file are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have a write access to the file for temporary files and target file?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the lecture of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The mission 1 reads the first piece of it, it is finished. but we have completed a new record: Contract 4 is the coding of pieces 1 in the format MP3. thus, please read and coding in parallel. NOTE the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings, to read this behavior, the number of parallel processes is to read and encode. with powerful machines, the result is unclear. the calculator is not a problem with the simultaneous reading and encode (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last titles is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order in the waiting long of the codierers. after the last piece is coded, a little window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, as the program may be adapted for your needs, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different other programs, has many variants to learn. best for example to learn the options and settings. it shows screens from different card cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, always yet to read? even if only the help was clicked out after the first strong start of the program, without any point out spot (above all, if the program is no audio CD; in the drive is), or from unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author can not be adventured. it is known as the first version for a manual and audiocreator; you can always do it. at least after the contact with the author and if you read this section, he has understood this section and is therefore understood with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you have managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN you don't need to use this information but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; the MIDI- and karaokesper von & kde;. besides other, he did not have real-time graphical and karaoke-real texts of texts also some features, the others & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI-synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS maps (for latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First you can choose... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also use a file from a & konqueror; window in the & kmid; window. this works also with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To watch a music piece, open it and run the button to play in the tool bar, select the entry version out of the menu item from or to make the space taste.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will start automatically, once you move it to the & kmid; window. (at several pieces they will be added to a collection and then fold in succession.)</seg>

<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust the events that should be displayed automatically and even better: the event settings will be selected automatically, so you will automatically choose the karaoke text, but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to adjust the events type, select from the menu settings the text entries and song events. the same function have also the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you are merged. these will be played in this section as you can use collections efficient.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To put a collection, first open the collection manager. these can be found in the menu collection below the point.... click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by copy in copy and then click the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can adjust the required values in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection will not be stored. concerns the when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs for a collection, it must be selected in the gathering manager. there you can add to add a song. it appears in again the file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the setting of automation.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If Automatic Add to the collection is activated, a piece of opening (using a file or drag & drop) automatically add to active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic add to the collection is not enabled, when the piece of a piece is activated, the collection will be activated and sent. this collection will continue to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection of collecting the collection and select the desired song, and then click below.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can choose the order, in which the songs will be played. if you select a series of the menu sequence of the menus, the songs were played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add a time or remove a random order in the menu, the order will be established.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To match a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump to a song, select the knob Next song, the entry next song from the menu, or press the arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the knob pre-made piece of the menu, or press the left arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, it doesn't matter if they are stored at the leaving & kmid; it is not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily necessary for synthesizer that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events in events that stands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-Map, which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet, and therefore always a trumpet, if it should play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have a soundcard, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards GM is compatible (including AWE and GUS maps, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI-maps. you have to edit the corresponding file of hand (with your favourite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that needs all necessary conversions for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which is so often appear as desired. for that, however, each additional textid possesses a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Check PATCHMAP... END LEKEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END define KEYMAP "an additional keymap... QUEND MOCHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that it is used to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and END that the end of a Sectiones is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send your map file as e-mail, so I can get in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, how the patches are shown by General MIDI on your specific keyboard. the general use can be seen as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation mark is ignored. it is believed that GM-patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to lay all sounds, who doesn't need this instrument on the sound with the number M (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to the PATCHMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is playing a score with Patch 127 (Rifications), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and play the sound 60, regardless of which sound in the MIDI file stands.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum-patch of Patch (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;), and not the one that means the sound height of the same drum (such as some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are depicted on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As the PATCHMAP section is the order of lines very important, as well as their advantages. you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several conymes for each channel and each instrument. you must only use different names only in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to remove sounds on the percussioner channels. look like the included Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to switch some channels on other types. if you want to switch the first and the second channel, simply make the very simple to the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is one of the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you are using the keymap option. if you are using the keymap option, all events are ignored, which are ignoring the patch on this channel. in this case, we will always use patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the percussioner patch on the caster channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio can be multiplied with the value of pitch bends. if so, if a MIDI file will be converted with the value of n * (r / 4096) and then only relayed. the value is 4096 will be used, thus in the map file is no decimal number.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM provides that a keyboard, that is a pitch of a pitch of 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards to play two sounds up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of keyboards (one for each MIDI-channel). on these sounds you can be played, which sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain canal. for each channel there is a selection list where you have changed an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, no more green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to indicate the sounds tones. view in the menu settings under the point of the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">Tempo-LCD displays the speed, with which a song is played, the higher the number, the larger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find, a song is too fast to change the text, you can use it. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the right and the right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about it like a music piece. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can use niemously zwingen, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. they have control over all.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, DEB) of & kmid; it's that happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to solve the problem, you need to download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To be understood, therefore, & kmid; drag & drop. open the file that you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and draw them on the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activate the setting for the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can find the arrow button on the left from the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the default tempo, click the LCD double.</seg>

<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file, if you add one file to the collection, then switch the setting of Automatic Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. once you want to play the first file. so set the setting of Automatic Add to the Collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you can also connect B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you make that?</seg>

<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a matching debugger plug in the project settings. with the button options beside the Debugger-plugin option, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated, some additional elements appear in & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that will be displayed in the contents of monitoring variables. usually, typically in the left Dock.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the day file and the tool. day file are handful, symorientatives of images (above the Editier window), the text and instructions faster into a document, than a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created (see below), download or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how the XML files are creating, then the & induction rc file; and also tool sets. shortly, one & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featuresalogy; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; itself. tool sets allow a fast insertion tags in a document without danger of a writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Day file are nothing as a folder. you contain only the & induction rc file; and the daily XML files. day file carry the name of the writings language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below listings the elements of the daily XML and declares whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use so many users using a better view and more information on the work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and boundaries will be explained in simple ways.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a daily XML document. it can only contain once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but does not contain any element type about himself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The Tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the daily class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only for the type beads. returns the name of the class, where this method is one. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute and the attributes within this Tags can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is intended by the & lt; text &gt; -Tag. this is a short element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This item describes a attribute of a Tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. additionally it contains the name and the type of attribute. additionally it contains additional tags that will describe how this attribute is to be displayed, etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Available source texts used for the attributes in the Day-Editordialog and in the Attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop-methodenname within & quantaplus; used to achieve data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a cutting and methodor names. the arguments that are handed over to the method. can be made empty or% daily name%, which means the name of the current Tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A box-day that evaluates the elements of a list. can only be found for a attributor of only once. it is a basic element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attributes of a tags within a dialog box. this day can only be found for each attribute in a dialogue (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -Tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Is the position and the size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for every field in dialogue. (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that can be found within the defining tags. this element is a short element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements which end a day. this element is a short element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -Deklaration start: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be washed and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not influence anything but look up & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; replaced, but some pieces of work would be disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">For checking the daily XML files, the tools can start up in & quantaplus; window window and check the XML. to choose. a further dialog appears to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, check only when charging the daily XML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family of 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; -element from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the filename for this day XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example for a functional family of 2 TagXML file. this file is described a & PHP; Overloading function. the filename of this day XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & directed rc file; -file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be edited via DTD Bearite DTD settings; for one of a list select & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & induction rc file; with the following entries will be created:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD-indication. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can be determined with the settings.... click on New promotion for the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion is assigned to this promotion. click on the button of each user, a key cuts can be assigned; with a result is the current key cuts.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detailed settings and in the promotion, this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful special type. with the help of this action can use external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that you can change the document or as input (or parts of the document), even the Schnellstart-dialog or the various See... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">As a first thing, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are permitted, it is recommended to use the% script.sh. this way tempted and quantitative local script: $KDEHOME / share / Apps / quantum / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable to be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document names are removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% PID: is being replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; only one instance is running to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; the external script will be used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters of this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above test methods, a script input from & quantaplus can be determined on the default input. in the evaluation input, what can be send to the default value. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the edition of the application can be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, on the default output file; it can be given to the default output format, by the value of the selected text is specified:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the market language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is not too many, therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure your settings. select the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action buttonhole at the bottom end of the window starts the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill all the necessary fields and add the day to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the day attributes and you are planning to plan your use, activate the dialog "day" when available, that is possible to use a input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is the most important symbol of the symbol. who should have the action in conjunction with this icon? replacing it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action will be better, we will use & kiconedit; then choose from the & menu;, graphic further programs (or where otherwise it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, select edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol is not only helps you know what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">In terms of that the day start, I decided to create a button-button as a symbol. by using the green (green becomes most likely to be interpreted, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user you can download, click here; -Tag can be found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of symbol, it must be connected with the action. this happens via the menu with the settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box there is a button, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Choose the file, in which the stored icon is, select it and confirm the OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the turn button and put them on other Tags, so there's still what else, or confirm your OK with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some common & quantaplus; functions for toolbar, or it should be divided this for better overview through some trinders can be divided into several groups. set the tool set to the toolbar tool. make sure that the desired tool bar can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the tracking (right above) for my tool bar. after the choice of element, to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar cannot believe that the & konqueror; -button on the opposite to the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by Probieren all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right file. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored in the right folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the right file. please adjust the tool bar (n) if a file is open (s) if a file is opened.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the chosen value extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatification language you like this chapter, as I describes a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; repository if a man has done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create a non-existent documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we need to handle the second part we will treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # items in the main index of item, e.g. php42, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # 3, tag2, day1.html day2 = day2.html day3 = day2.html day3 = day3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible parts of documentation in the document tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">NOTE the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that there are no known limit for the tree (except by the tilt) mdash; but try it out itself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You know that the contents are referenced directly to a file (and consistent with the upper end of building view & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not influence nothing but look at & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourceship files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The ingredient is the scope of the docrc file, which is to be displayed directly. by writing a & PHP; -scripts, documentation for the mysql _ FETCH _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the list of text list (ContextList) and the file binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of common language elements that should be available (for & PHP; and these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply save after $HOME / .kde / share / Apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / Apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then you create a folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this well and it is valued, send your docrc file using a description of important information, e.g. what documentation is used to use the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have been working with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) with email, toolbars and folders in templates and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, of where all the other & quantaplus; if our team needs to be correct, making it a GPG / PGP key. therefore, the source of resources are guaranteed, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">At the upload your passport are asked for their private GPG keys (the Passihrase is not stored), or in the case that you have completed several keys, you can stay out. in the dialogue New resource, the input must be filled out (URL-preview can remain empty) and will start with click of OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The loading can be loaded up of the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar, toolbar tool bar is highly loading, and in the context of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading of resource, even before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource stimulates the integrity and the resource. in case of problems, it can be returned to correctly. if the integrity was given, a message appears with the indication of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; because hundreds of day files in the day XML is necessary, there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD shop and converts of a DTD option. select the .dtd file containing the DTD description that will be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / Apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definitions set: the string set in! DOCTYPE Tag as well as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd appears</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP according to the conversion: if enabled, produces & quantaplus; based on the conversion to the & induction rc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there is some key concepts that do this to understand and full advantage of & quantaplus; this chapter tries to give them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this differentiation is concerned with a range of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; stored in the common folder Correction of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators different tool, actions and patterns in the global tree to secure, which are available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of Webdevelopment for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user directory, so it can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be done everything from & CSS; -patterns can be specially arranged for the files of a certain project. all elements are filed in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the edit windows, the manageous view, the map with information and the tool. please beat in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can download the boxes with the right mouse button in order to obtain a text menu with the current document, like about the current, other or all cartons, reloading or download of the document, jump to an output or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Justifies in editing area lead to another context of documentation, such as basic processing step (cutting / copy / paste), editing under the mouse inter or open the file if the string measured under the mouse inter is called a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the end of the editors are the tool set of the Editors. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars will be adjusted to the new features and thus connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to add one day, e.g. & lt; pgt; you can find the data for this straight day, then you can add the data for this straight day (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Construction mansion (QIT;) enable it to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate them to open them and strips. in the presentation with Karteireitres are available for files, project, patterns, attributes, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project using legal mouse click. actions like Add, removing, loading or deleting of files from storage media can be carried out with which then displayed text menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost all can be a template: images, program parts, a whole web site & etc; there are all possibilities to open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which the connection it is used. global templates are always available, local templates just for the corresponding users and templates are available only in the project. more information is available in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available script file. the concept of draws in Global, Lokal and project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can download the available information on a script. about the rights is available, such as the script will start to work or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-click of element the cursor in document to the position of Elementes, is a list of command in terms of navigation and collection of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other construction projects. with it can change manfast attributes and namespaces. this entry-related entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for your development. it can be downloaded documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'document can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes of boxes at the bottom end of the window, can be achieved above the useable information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This board selector shows information about any in Quanta running script. for example, the DTD used the current document and all modifications to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cartilage shows all the errors of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are carried out, give all error reports (such which gives) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. Show it on a symbol and you get the appropriate command. the chocolate set of the tool is the option to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send an tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar-archive about & kmail; if they get a tool bar in an email, they can download these in & quantaplus; as any other backup and loading!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantaplus; if you want to transfer the configure Skript. in order to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and here not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble at the start of & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin file. also you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH before her bin file is. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined with a wide range of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; -Editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to work with an adjacent idea that would be an independent market-up languages? well, this would make him a absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Not longer on pure & HTML; restricted, is & quantaplus; now you can define it on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantaplus; therefore the appropriate & IDE can be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding effort of all & kde; the idea is not only possible? thanks to the & de; -scaffold is not only all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; so as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity for almost every task. due to self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, they can have to have any script syntax. (more about it will find them in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a fast web development and was developed quickly as well as mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quantitative; Plus is associated with commercial versions of & quanta; connected. the original developer left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the individual documentation is help with help: / quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quantitative; currently developed and maintained by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick release list of files you have opened. this list changes every time if you can open a file, which is not found on it, whereby the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for the later usage. you should try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project management system, only one error reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted from the Middle rack there, the special characters contained in & HTML; caption, so that they are displayed correctly and not from the browser as a formatting assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the interchange in & URL; -Schabortion, which is the correct way for insertion special characters and spaces in & URL; s. in the first line to the Inserted & URL; s in the Anker day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or off. it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. that is very helpful if your & PHP; -script error reports available!</seg>

<seg id="2155">The fields are self explanatory and should be filled out at the top of the project called the entire directories for the rest of the project. all these paths and author Information fields can be completed later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when input of name is automatically filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small booking and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the machine address the machine that you want to access local data. either a name (hostname.example.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>

<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from local file system to the project. it can be selected several files or whole file.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you can download and change it. on serverside scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) it must be different.</seg>

<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project was open. this behavior can't be influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, open project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar. the dialogue is open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved, if you want to store changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; modified files. same happens if you can download a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management gives free access to the files in the project. there, can be administrated the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but are missing the entries and open with the right mouse button menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here, several profiles can be found here. profile information about the site of the highly adjoining files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profils. if only one profile is present, the button is blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the core memory and can be forgotten in programmer. this option is useful if the most common high load of files is necessary and the rather unsecure password on the plate store -option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog when you change your opinion before the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-ladeprofiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) to be uploaded on different servers. when editing or creation of a profils, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server that will be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the load. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves from. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually it must not be changed, except the network administrator does not work on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attackets, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. do it stored on the plate, so that it cannot be read, but everyone with programming languages can easily be seen in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set files and toolbars. it can be loaded into a project lots of views, i.e. by simple excretion of view, several files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently openable files and tool.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool bar, accessible via Settings tool bar project tool bar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most to do. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own work.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As above mentioned above are tools in & quantaplus; best available via the menu toolbars. use and add to the tool. the aspect of toolbars will be treated down in the section Hinds of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and symbols may be set either by using the context (right click on the tool bar), in which the new action can be removed, toolbar cutting or toolbar, which can be displayed in the dialog, where you can be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">Through the call of the text's text to a action (symbol) on a tool bar, the entries will remove entries and action, are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and promotions can be set up on them in the menu with the settings of the settings... and settings are set aside.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in the essential document, code-calopes and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates, postpone or any of the system existing directory in the preceding tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations that you see for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied with delivered conditions for their use. please read the conditions of any template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file apart from text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted into documents by linking (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples is found in the advance tree under global templates. more information on templates is available in stock.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by each text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents have been created. usually, a simple assembly for the purpose and organising the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found under global templates. see in for more information to the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This species is useful if not a new document based on an advantage but the same text area always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples have to be found under global templates. see in for more information to the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are organized for all websites as templates. they are organized a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a compressed tar archive. currently there is no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure to Popular (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose the file as an entrance to the local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as the happen, you notice that (even if it was stored as a project situation) the situation is not visible in the project tree. look at the project tree under project management.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on the file as a local / project template. alternatively, the option can easily be pulled with pulling and lay up on the construction.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be used in a system file. it can be used to create all file management functions such as goat and lay, or Insert on the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select in the file tree or in the project files, click on a folder to the right and secure the site template. by default, the project is secured, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project suggestions allow a very precise approach. you can merge headlines and footage or dynamic with & PHP; design, processing files or associated with them. in addition, you can keep some things by templates in projects very profound in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The advanced structure in the window templates is based on the $KDEDIR / share / Apps / quantum / Templates and $HOME / .kde / share / Apps / quantum / templates. each of this file corresponds to one of four types of containers, as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, select the right mouse button on the file and select the text-menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is covered, as soon as usual attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all apart from the role model in the plant. if a regular player would be disabled, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal file, the Blah would appear with something like text construction. if nothing appears, it is probably found in a regular ordner.</seg>
<seg id="2213">According to pre-set or pre-set text for templates in this file. this may be general headlines or footlines for all templates for a specific project and enables a special presentation with a special headlines in a special headlines with the matching headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, a text menu (shown on view, right mouse button) has a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste the templates from a place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; and source code editor that can be reached via the menu tab. the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit the source code editor in which the result is visible in the VPL; -Editor in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">At work with the VPL; -Editor to a document, the & PHP; it is not possible to edit the Vohandenever from & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; -Editor, it is not possible to change the source code editor. there is no plans to change this behaviourless.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that simultaneously the changes in the source code editor and in VPL; -Editor synchronizes in the source code editor and in the VPL; -Editor synchron is already active in this mode, this mode is already active, retrigger the active cursor from a window to attach the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via synchronization by VPL; -view, one can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be set in addition to a click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be set to fast computer and a great Spanish for slow PC.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose, one wants to change the title of the website, so it is possible to select the document properties in the work with the VPL; -Editor, as soon as a new document with the VPL; -Editor will be created. this means the change of the hanging of the body. thus, you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allows the store of information about the document itself, e.g. whip elements for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added by pressures of the contents below or removed. a click into the list allows the change of content, such as key words on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to the design of a look of pages on the browser. you can list CSS rules on the list below list. a change over the list is exactly as with the Meta elements. this is currently not supported by CSS rules.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to adjust the external CSS style template by using the file button and chooses the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is like in a text-processing, because of them with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor can works as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by intiffs and can be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The tags of Tags will be done in the same way about the tool, as described in the source code editor, as if an Anker day is not removed, e.g. if a Anker day, surrounded by text, each other is necessary Anker day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables assistent or the lists assistent are deactivated. they will be used later in & VPL; this release must be used in this release the tables or lists of toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to Compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me tell me why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributions had undertaken many changes simultaneously. another programmers had changed the same file in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts at merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">That was used by me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within this lines. and there was no notices on the digits, where the result of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be able to display differences within a row and changes to white signs. later, any number of more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare it fast text, copy it simply into the intermediate shelf and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the Compare and merge of folders. this function turned & diff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way assembling is fully supported. this is useful if two persons are independent of each other in one piece and changes the original file. in this editor, you can even edit the result before. in this editor, you can even edit the result below. the image photo shows three Quell files at the merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you complete the Compare and merge complete file. this screen photo shows & diff3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and reflect to the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are visible. if lines just differ in a certain number of white signs, you can see at a look at the summary of the page on the left side. (no doctor more if the man changes the reverse)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in a row, then shows the colour that file is different. red colour means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same names, but in different folders, then you can simplify the filament to write only the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner3 -o Zielordner</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog enables the manual of file names to select the option of file browser (file...) or the select one of the latest file from the opening list. you need to specify it in the next time. if you don't have to specify the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">If you select a file, you can choose to select a file, if you select a file, if you choose a file, for B and C but a file, then uses and kdiff3; the file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merged crosses, the input field is active for target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to determine immediately a output file. you can also use this step later on the store.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup -button opens a dialogue with settings. here you can specify options before you start with the info Compare action.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare all of a text, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the interchange to the active comparison window. when comparison begins, you can't select any files, you can simply connect the dialogue with the break -button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use a goat and pick you: draw a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind? sometimes it contains a file e.g. several similar functions. if you want to figure like these functions, it would need to create a relatively large effort. you would need to copy it into & diff3; download and compare these relevant sections simply copy, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">NOTE: currently you can recover anything from & kdiff3; only the fieds of text is supported in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some edit the goat and lay out of text in another program as a cut and Insert (instead of copying and Insert). in such case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each word window, the info line contains the characters A, B or C, the file names and line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that window is optional.) Every way to rest for a file, leave the mouse a while on the line. then a small help window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. it has the colour blue, B the colour green and C is magenta. (this default settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, you can distinguish what file is different. (color for conflicts in the settings), the default color is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text, the column is displayed. when differences were found, the column is displayed. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only relevant characters only in character strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare single cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line which separates the collapse of the text is interrupted by the digits, where the source file does not have lines. if the line breaks is activated, the line will show line on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result-window (under the comparison windows) also has a info line with the inscription edition:, the filenames and [changes] if you have the result it usually contains the text, but often contains it conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! to all conflicts are deactivated, the store is deactivated!!! (do you use the buttons to the next soldered / UNGESOLUEN conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative window can be used, each difference may be solved in the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Through a click with the left mouse button in one of the window, the first row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will never be visible. (this group will not be visible in the beginning of the group otherwise.) This group will be lifted up with the color background colour for current area and on the left appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic transmission, or by manual facts, no further line will be in the case; then it is only a placeholder for the case that you can change your opinion, and perhaps there will be another source. this text appears either in the final stored file, even in a mark that you may copy and insert differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; collation conditions; however, appears in the intermediate shelf, when you copy such text from the results window. go careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">NOTE: if the sources chose the options to ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly with the picture channel and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can use the right side, side down, end, strg-beginning and shg-end, as you can also use it from other programs. the oversire-column next to the vertical image download can also be used by hints.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye-window, you can also use the other keys to edit buttons. with the inserting button you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the entry mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary-columns synchronizes the view of all the window at the beginning of the respective group (as already in section merge and the edited output module).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons to the current / first / last difference to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-image / Strg-up), for the next / predominant conflicts, even after manual receptions are still considered a conflict. therefore, between dissolved and UNGESOLUTIONS have to be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the marking in the intermediate shelf, you need to copy the copy Speed button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is activated, you'll need to copy it automatically into the meantime. be careful with this option, because you might require the contents of the intermediate shelf.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line of line will be stored according to the elevated operating system. UNIX variants use a line feed character\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the line output of the source file not at, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">Options and list of the latest files will be stored automatically and restored to the next start. (menu setting ungen- &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a lettering with fixed width. (in some systems, the dialog appears also available with variable width, you should not use this but not use.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in short lettering. if the chosen scriptures are not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colours, some colors are not available in their pure form, but would be broken down. on these systems, the buttons will automatically match an unfolded colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, when the tabulator button is inserted into the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise a table character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or Return, the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, each selection will be copied into the middle rack. the manual copy is in the middle shelf.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select whether line of line type you prefer to store. the default value is the general value on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When you are trying to find files & diff3; first, all entirely identical lines can be ignored during this stage. the second step can't be ignored every row. in this step, white signs will not be ignored. also when merging white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editing (in some systems) save a car reset '\' at the end of a line, but then you could see files with different sizes on page-side-side comparison, but then you might have different dimensions in the page-an page. however, if this option is enabled, however, this option must be disabled. during the collision, this option must be disabled. this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding character ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored in the result, however, the differences are still displayed as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensiv after smaller subdivide. option is enabled in default setting. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatic-jump mode, this setting will be shown, as long as the result of the selection, before the next UNGESOLUTIONS will be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatically all conflicts in white characters each. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white signs can be used in figures or comments, if the automatic selection should be ignore in numbers or comments, if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in chapter to Scanning folders and merge of a merging. look for details under documentation on the directory and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and is already an older version, then the original version is the Suffix .original version, if already one such password file with the Suffix .original exists, this will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of user interface. changing this option does not need to finish the current running program. you need & kdiff3; finish and restart the change is active. (this option is set to the KDE version of & diff3; because the language is stopped globally on the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be set separately for each entry. if one option activated this option, for all entries the upper setting is used.</seg>
<seg id="2340">On the selection fields for coding, a short notice that is to be modified to local code. (this may not be changed here and has not an informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code for source files. this is influenced how special characters can be treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared with different coding and can be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file, you can define the coding of storing a file.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define the processing volume, they could not work with your codec. (e.g., your files will be 16-bit ASCII, but the procedure command can only be set with 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn these to modify the changes of changes in white signs in text or review. (NOTE: this applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you are three files. in normal mode all differences are displayed in a colour encoded side-column. but sometimes, you may only see the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is still displayed next to the normal still a second oversire column with the necessary information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space for long lines. don't just use the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">The comparative window in the side by side or overlap. this can be beneficial to display of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and choosing files to perform files. if you use only two files and use the filename of the last source file as preset names for the output file. (if this function is used to start the merging file, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it becomes visible to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which means that function can be used to cut out parts or correcting the integration.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is presented to this external command, then the output of command command is used only when using the command. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds to your requirements. each input line must have an corresponding issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought to allow users more flexibility when using the diff results. however, an external program does not need to program, and most users want to program the good news. the good news is, that in most cases, or perl are fully sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this procedure command for line with the input in large letters: SED\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's. *\\' in the Ernaming character sets refers to the found text in the first clause. the\\ U converts the found text in large letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems apply some key words to include automatically records: SED\\ _ BAR _ Log\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ BAR _\\\\ _ BAR _\\\\ _ BAR _\\\\ _ BAR _\\\\ _ BAR _\\\\\\\\\\\ $is necessary because $a special characters can mean and end of the line would mean.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you have experimenting with them, you might make it to understand and perhaps you like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The noignore of numbers are actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it's good as an example for another preference command for line-equal suitable. one's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Jedes character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you would like to perform several statements on once. then you can use the semicolon ';' in order to split apart from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of use, you can also use something different like e.g. perl. perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / ON / Switch' All that are required at perl some details. where to\\\ (and\\), it requires perl only (and) without the specified '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">Data according to the normal preprocessor-processor for display and merge. furthermore, the other operations are only changing the data, which sees the line-equal algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">NOTE: in rare cases if you use a normal Preprocessor, the line of line preprocessor sets the output of the normal preprocessor-processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but like every function, the text changes or differences, you can't notice certain differences in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers must work in a file many files. from this reason, you can compare with & diff3; complete file reitalic and merged together.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal to perform a proposal; you can adjust the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can it be simulate and shows the simulated changes to do without them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads selected actions either with all (F7 key), or just with the selected objects (F6-key).</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the Compare and merge of individual files very similar. you must open a file on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders will be merged, then Ordner1 is used as a basis. if no target file is specified, and kdiff3; Ordner3 as target file.</seg>
<seg id="2367">NOTE that only the folders will start automatically, not the merging. to start the merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the read of the folder, you informed a small news window over the current progress. if you start the scan of the file, only the files are listed until then compared.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scan of the file is completed, shows & kdiff3; a listing window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Any file and any file of the scan is found during the scan, click here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder Correction is usually folded. you can click on the + / - click on the object or select the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu includes two functions of subdirectories and all subdirectories can be open to which you can open all the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file comparison will start and appears to be a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the data type in the first file (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type in the other folder is different, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object. if the merging is started automatically, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colours A / B / C are red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder as the same as the same as its overall content is identical. then, folder is the same color. in folder is the age unconsiderably for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaflet, which is green, then yellow and later, when it is old, red is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exists, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exists, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... b and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exists, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. if A a folder and B a file is): error: contradictory datatypes. as long as such defective objects exist, the merging cannot be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if A a folder and B a file is): error: contradictory datatypes. as long as such defective objects exist, the merging cannot be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active, if only two folders and no explicitites target is specified and if the option is synchronize, then chooses the calculation 3; the necessary action is identical, so they both files are identical. if for one record...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not the same: merging and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as visible file names for the output file only B; directly after the merge and diff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be merged and select the newer file for copying files. if the files are different. if the files are different, but the date is the same date, but the date is identical.. ceps such error cannot be fixed, cannot be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the collision, a file named after the other uses, if the collision was successful, and according to other messages, if the result is concluded, you should take a last review and see if the status is okay with order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If applicable in the connection dialog, KDiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged).</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can select either the just selected entry (file or Odner), or any entries at once. if you have chosen all the gathering actions (also in all sub-folders), you can start the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have a target file, then it will be used in three-folders mode C as target while two-folders merges will be chosen as target and synchronize A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have chosen a target file, please check if all entries may be displayed in the target file, also in the Ordnerstone correction, there are some options to avoid by certain items. check these options to avoid unbelievable surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To perform all entries: select directories / continue in the directory "menu or press F7 (the key contraction). in order to execute the current version: select the current version or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to contradictory datatypes are still invalid assemble actions, a message appears that shows the faultely elements. you can select a valid promotion for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you meet all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options run, simulate and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen to be done without any changes. you will receive a detailed list of all promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then take certain actions with all entries by. if a manual procedure is necessary (together a single file), then opens a collision window (note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select once again and press F7. if you don't have saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then you will continue to continue its work with the next story.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, notify me of updates and detailed Status information. at the end of the list, you can try to transfer the cause of problem to try or the problematic record. thus, you have the opportunity to select a different action for entry or problem, before you continue with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some items have been assembled together, see & kdiff3; these entries are not taken together in the current session. even if the result was not saved, or not saved, these entries are regarded as erlepers. only if you change the assembly action, these entries are attributed to the merging action.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed on the displayed pattern, are displayed several samples in the elelement. separate space holders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. file must not comply with this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, are not shown in the element tree. it can be displayed more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a sign. valid space holders: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, are not shown in the element tree. it can be displayed more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a sign. valid space holders: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that are ignored by CVS, and many authorised files will be ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this file specified with a .cvsignore file. (please refer to info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems you have a Veritable attribute. in other file systems marked a file as hidden. this option can choose whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to Files: if the option is switched off, symbolic link is compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to show the links. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Links to folder, if the option is switched off, the links are treated like normal file and recursively searched. (note that the link will be treated like normal file and replenished. a link to a folder would lead to a dudlosschleife and & kdiff3; clash off.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of any file through and shows the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, untested, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it is applied to files, which does not contain any text. (give an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large file over a slow network, it may possibly faster than the change date and the file size. this option is to use a certain measure. please use this option in default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the amendment of date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered as the same as it is equal to, if copying the change date. please use beware. this option is abidated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activate synchronize mode if two files are compared and no target file. in this mode the suggestions are so chosen, so the results are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of coping the copying of the newer file as a action. (this is sure that the other file is not changed also.) This option is switched off in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a file is renamed or deleted, then the original version is renamed and receives the original version with the .original extension already exists, this without further backup is deleted, not only the merging single files, not only the merging file folder. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder extensions can be visible with the mouse button. if you don't want to move the window with the mouse, you can switch the window box in the window menu and switch via the switch between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer, a file simply by double-click. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can use a single file as well as you can start your folder. if you use the result, the status will not be converted again, and the file will not run once again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is still lost, if you have to read the directory: directory "Menu: new!</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO-slaves. KDiff3 uses this way to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open, which are on local or remote bills.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on FTP server. the second command line compares a file within a compressed archive with a local file.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has other syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should notice:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relatively high. or... that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes on the server system, sometimes on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished if a link shows a file or a file. then it is always adopted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to work permissions or change date. hence the permissions or change date from the original. (notice the option of the size.) (This is only allowed to local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose unit is currently available as a differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop will always start the built-in differences viewer. in order to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences and then select in KDiff3Part display from the text menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually, and kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a KPart file, it takes or kdiff3; the names of the original files must exist at least one of the two files. then starts & kdiff3; the patch will need to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, you can select a patch file and select from the text menu of preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this doesn't work if any of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files has been changed since production of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it is only supported the Compare from two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the collars or the info is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is Kompare) there is already. furthermore, the name KDiff3 has already shown that it can lead to the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>

<seg id="2431">You haven't compiled the program from the sources and configure skript. in the default setting configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you can find information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs are different, these lines should be treated as identical; if, however, only a non-white character is different, the line is not identical. if, lines, next to each other, this, is coined, this ois.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will need for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends. this important information is only lost, if the result is easily stored as text file, and it's too much effort to design your own file format, which could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has so far too large. you can reproduce a specific version of the select a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After the remove text is suddenly, no src directory; published and the text can't be clear and the text can't be extinguished. what does it be removed?</seg>

<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system, installed in the KDE. if you are uncertain, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automaker, you should no problems when compile. should not be difficulties, report on the & kde; -mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cutting (Ctrl-X or Umschalt removes) copied into the selected text and extinguishes the text from the intermediate shelf on the current cursorposition or replacing the current market.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are shown: files that are identical in all files are not shown in folder, and therefore not in target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to update the folder with the function update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are shown, the differences will also be copied. if the target files are not already copied in the target file, if the target file is not already changed, however, this option can be switched off in a later program version.</seg>
<seg id="2448">NOTE the buttons on the source with the select A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are on one of the buttons on the end of the selected group (if they are not already available), if the lines are already available, they will be back on the button on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. Underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minivorschau of all virtual working areas. it is quite practically to change the current programs on the working areas to change their size or to move it. this works both within a working area than also with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can view all virtual working areas as well as the current applications. the applications can be selected and even on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the intermediate mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager. moving, the movement is possible to be able to other working areas within a working area.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The text-menu depends on which the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of & kpager. however, the context of the text appears only the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries, maximize, on workspace and extent. the commands will follow the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of workspace. it appears only when using an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Kicked up the application to select the selected virtual desktop. it appears only when using an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If the crucifixtures can be marked, window within the & kpager; s can be postponed within the storage area and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, are displayed in & kpager; the names of the virtual desktop areas.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Enabling this field can view the & kpager; the numbers of virtual working areas. is it along with name display, are provided with ordination numbers, & eg; 1st working area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background every working area is also displayed as background in the & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small window in the & kpager; now. others are displayed on the empty working areas to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program windows. simply shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & kpager; -main window will be known: Classic sets and kpager; like from Pager applications in some other sightages; horizontally shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal line and perpendicular in a vertical series, which is very well suited for the representation of the working area.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager-miniature range in the control panel. it has the advantage that it can be changed into the size, the window as a symbols or with their content. it also runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click on the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent select switch-switch... lets the dialog appears.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment it can't be changed in the dialog, but you can do this manual:</seg>

<seg id="2483">In the default setting up & can be enlarged in the area around the mouse pointer as a mobile Lupe. alternatively, you can choose to display an additional screen area in the enlargement window (optional selection mode) or the surroundings of the mouse button on the screen edge (eg; on the left edge of the edge).</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousool; emulated a mouse click on the same spot. it is meant to help people to make people using the repetitive fuel Injury (RSI) syndrome, and every mouse click pains. moreover, it can emulate the goat with the mouse. this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousool; can pain also be caused by the clicking of the mouse, and helps to use the computer without pain. suffering from pain, you should try to work with the use of your computer, you should not happen to a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to draw it even once again: even if & mousal ool; pain helps that are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain, which is caused by the mouse to the mouse, and as for all ergonomic tools, the result can be very different for each other.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitored your mouse movement and leads a mouse click when you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent translation is enabled, power & mousool. move the mouse, waiting it until the end of the movement, before the indulge of the mouse button is executed. the smart translation requires a little exercise, but you are reconciled to them.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This sentence must be used after the end of the mouse movement, before & mousool; a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is smart translation is enabled, the time offset time is switched (1 / 10 s). here, the time is stopped, after removing the mouse button, before the mouse button is waiting again, if there is no evidence for mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousool; it is now activated by mouse button. this function is activated, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. this moves are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; to move the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select the sound system and here the rider there. there is an arbitberegler sound buffer that you turn to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it is selected and kmousetool; at every start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available in GNOME or other window manufacturers please install the respective documentation, as you will start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings back to the values that were set to opening the dialog box. if you have already put the button in turn, the settings will be back on the status after the last drums.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent translation should first be switched off. if you have reconciled the automatic click here, you can see a smart translation.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the response times of & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of first, you should make a mouse click without effect: click on the neutral ingredients of windows or on digits in browser window, which does not have link to uncertain reactions. you can parked the mouse to such places, until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is clean, you should clean your mouse. it is usually quite simple. the trick is quite simple. the trick is clean, but also the rolls that come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First of all, you need to take the mouse ball. as this is done by mouse to mouse. it should be very clear when you see the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball's ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole, in which the ball was used. the dirt and contamination can be easily removed with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations breaks the operating system version of & kmousetool; if you just started a shift in this case, it means that & mousefool; the operation doesn't finish anymore due to a lot of mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousool; use another window manager and one window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click here. by this, the status of & kmousetool; set it and you can continue as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & mousool; still mouse clicks and set the cursor to another point.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Workaround: use the mouse to place the cursor's mouse, if you don't want to make sure that the mouse click on a neutral area. secure zones for mouse pointer and eg; the gray areas around the mouse control and menus.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I'm trying to edit the smart translation, but I create it not to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent translation is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can easily move on this way, if you want to move the mouse with expressly Maustaste. but it will probably prepare it only once more problems. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the smart translation not, if you just start the end of the text area instead, click the end of the text area a mouse click and keep the UmschAlt-button, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and click the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. therefore, if & kmousetool; the mouse button is expressed a sound like a mouse click. later, you can easily use the intelligent translation can also use without the audible mouse click without the audible mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window, it must be installed on most system the case.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers are equipped correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousool; betting the mouse button soon as soon as the mouse pointer is very hard. this program was developed for people who suffers to the RSI syndrome, and those who are emphasized the mouth of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting for a goat, before the mouse is loosed. in this way, the goat and disassembling can be carried out with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2622">To understand the working wise of filters, it is important to know how the program "" dispatcher "works with an text. & ktts; differs four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The issue of Screen Speakers has moved the highest priority. it will be presented with all other orders. if the edition of the Screen reader is read, the continued orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning has the next priority. this stage is important news such as & eg; processor is getting hot. a warning has preceding and maintains the issue of news and normal text. these orders will continue to continue after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the closest text priority. a message subject to normal text. & kmouth; is an example of a application that can be used for a long text on a web site, you can access to the room with & kmouth. messages are also messages. Read the messages. Read all about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each contract that is used by the card ticket is a text order. KSayit is an example for applications that have text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer text, who have no particular dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All of the four order types will be shipped in waiting-long, with the exception of the issue of Screen Speakers. if a use of a Screen-reader uses, while & ktts; just one such narrator, this output is adjusted and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of Screen Speakers. they are applied to normal warning, messages, and text orders as well as & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter rework the text and give him to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are as Modules. in the future it can be used further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character pins replace parts of a text by other text, which can be used either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be used with predefined character using chat messages like: -) by text or for the reformatment of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and punctuation filters (SDB-filter). SBDs may contain text in unique phrases. thus, you can't need to keep the whole text assignment. thus, you can also stop or stop or break, even if the language synthesizer it not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the proposition of limitations filters. when the first start of & ktts; it will be automatically established as a precursor position filter. you can change the settings or further statutable filters, starting with them.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the easiest way to try out the speaker run by try out. please check the speaker systems, change the speaker systems. if you have changed some features and check out how the selection of the speaker is changed, otherwise you have to have more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts you can start with the advance, since only the first set can be processed, and not the whole text block which can take very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">They then impressed text orders on card ticket or break, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal movement border filters will be set automatically when you can start kttsmgr for the first time. it can't be switched off, just away. change nothing at that filter, it be, you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters from text with a regular expression of punctuation and add a table sign (decimal code 8) to the proposition limit (table sign will be automatically removed from the text). NOTE that the default position of the disposition filter is attached automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied to & sound; messages (knotify), warnings, messages, or output by Screen Speakers.</seg>

<seg id="2741">Marking the check box when the property has to set before other features. you can also set multiple markings.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding of the output, this feature is rarely used. the only case, if you may specify the attribute language you'll need to specify the attribute files in another language than the result of the working environment.</seg>

<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; enables the user management of a series of system and DesktopSettings about a single, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter can be called via K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to enable the management of TCP / IP network settings in the same manner as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; creating a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; displayed. module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selkcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & menu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It's important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical appliances and their driver must already be installed and configured, thus & knetworkconf; this device is depicted and the attitude of the network properties enables.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added with instaleren of & Linux; with installed and set. networks later added, the driver supporting the following files must be charged according to the kernel version.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be recharged if the option is selected in & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when the module's network settings are trying to recognize the platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the platform is offered in the list, which corresponds to the distribution and the reeasiness on the best. due to mark the setting, the settings can be met permanently. when the next start of the network settings will be automatically preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings are possible only in the system administrator mode. previously, all options can be seen, the settings can only be viewed, the change can be not possible. in the system administrator mode on the right at the right end of the module. it is the input of the password required.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces are used to manage the network of the system. all available networks are displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The adjustments to display network interfaces can be processed by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the push of the button... in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, basic TCP / IP settings are available. click on the button Show advanced settings shows the dialogue with advanced ways.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection of the TCP / IP settings, the TCP / IP settings are supported by a DHCP server or BOOTP server, all required TCP / IP information on each system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, no DHCP or BOOTP can be performed in TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network is the subnetmask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initialize the network interface at the boat. if the initialization cannot be desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">In this dialog, values are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not used to lead a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network should be asked.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distribution (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient to install it, and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is just the rpm package downloading and in one & console; with rpm such as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development stage with libraries and others are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & kneetworkconf; the following commands should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network systems will be discussed in the second, all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This range can not be replacing the knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information on the PCs are used in a small (home system) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated using TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). well, 5 has never been found large spread. by IPv6, this description is concentrated in close future. this description is concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address of a network interface. in foreign network, on & eg; workplace, the network administrator to be allocated or if available, DHCP can not be used. definitely, the IP address can not be chosen as any event!</seg>
<seg id="2842">At the setting of a own small (home) network of network should be selected for this purpose of reserves for this purpose, to avoid IP address data to the global (Internet) network, so the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the internet, so it is possible to use any possible use.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course you can access the Internet for such machines due to a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, usually addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, net mask is usually set on 255.255.255.0 so all the computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route which requires the loopback address (localhost = its own computer). the standard route is needed for IP further action.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in local own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is an option for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create several archives on one band. the second aim was to answer a question that my wife said, How much longer takes it if you have secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be done by & dat; it can be done on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; Spult the band back and reads the tensioning information of the band. recognizes and dat record, if you don't ask if the band will be formatted if the band is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects and cate; the pre-hearing, searches it according to the appropriate index on your record. can't be asked if the band index will be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything has gone round, the symbol for the tape drive, in order to indicate that the band was put into a corresponding message. the volume of the band can now be searchable. the volume of the band can now be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before the design of the band it must be solved, first the entry must be solved. there are three methods to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; available through a change of symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the tape and shows a corresponding message. the band can now be discarded without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & dat; can be used, it must be formatted by & dat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band types must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this procedure is necessary to be formatted before use before you can find out of the band from & dat; do not apply to floppy disk plants. floppy disk plants usually do not apply.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity drives & dat; with the formatting of the band, all data on the band are lost! after completion of the form, the band will automatically be bound and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the intesting files. it can be done on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or a file in the local file tree. it is secured only this file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Marking a backing profile in a tree. it will only be secured by the specified files.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Marking files in the local file tree with one skins. only the so marked files and / or subfile are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can use the reproduce, the files you need to be restored, can be marked on two types:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or a file in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the belt movement. it is made only the selected file or the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Marking the desired files from one of the archives with a leaflets. they are made only the so marked files and / or subfile.</seg>

<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialogue appears to reproduce. this dialog shows the progress of recreated, as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the belt file using the band inhaler. this process triggered all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a fuses profile with the straight marked files and the default settings. you can also use the following settings for the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder, which should be made in which the backup should be updated automatically, according to the chosen folder automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For any file that are listed under backup files, that only the files can be backed up on the same file system, as specified in the file systems, you can apply separately under backup files. each entry is independent of tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Conduct a continuous backup. to determine which files have been changed since the last inkage file, a snapshot file will only be secured, which have changed since ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine changes have been used since the last inkage source.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file in front of tar. this means that all files will be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the knobs files & gt; and lt; lt; files was not completely implemented for the time of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can take:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device-file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transfers & dat; before the tape is bound to the drive. if some drives is necessary, it can be performed before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">This option is switched on, trying to unlock it; possibly this setting will not work at all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If enabled, the option is switched on, when dissolve the binding of & dat; automatically discarded the band. use this option not at floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & cate; the harddisk block size for tape drives. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must be & cate; in any case the block size for your tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & cate; a band is formatted, write it a file to the start of the band. this file should just stack a disk on the tape. the contents of the file is set up together:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N byte) The band ID. the format of this character is bailed: seconds, and the invoices of the system is formatted. seconds is the number seconds that has been formatted since the era has been formatted in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID will be used to find a file using the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar -archives that can operate directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar -versions should work, while there is not a incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a securing. this icon is only active when a band is bound.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Panel viewer for system protocolle. this program is not able to know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to perform the different protocol files. beyond that, you can upgrade the rapid access for example on information about problems which will appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps to understand your calculator in the background. the program is suitable for unexperienced users, which can not know where you can't know information about your system or where the system puts the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can provide fast access for example on information about problems which can be appearing on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore some advanced functions are able to be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, we have systemlog; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition, and will be explained in the other chapters.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, provides & ksystemlog; functions are available, with the help of a protocol file easily filtering and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, we try & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protoclog in which you can't start with system-walterright. the protocol files will usually take advantage in the folder / var / log, for the normal users usually have no authorization to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filtering a character set into the filter panel. in the default setting, the selection box contains the record line. in the default setting it will only be displayed, if in one of the columns, the string set of the filter search engine is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select one other entry. the string set of the filter searchin will then choose the column process, and carry it out in the filter strip the name of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines should be sent, or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol-lines. protocol lines of level errors will be displayed with a higher color images than the protocol-lines of levels. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to view only certain process (for example, in system protocoll or in the cron protocol), you can try to investigate the process identification (PID) in the column process, as for example, if you want to investigate the output of a certain command as the example of the Samba server. in this case you are using filter strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to make new lines in the context of the main window to make all new upcoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files into separate windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open more window and manage. once you have selected a window on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. dort you will find more recent information about the access of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; find also in the following folder des & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following so named) as & ksysv;. this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init develops quickly to the standard for control of the program running at the high drive system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and also more flexible than the traditional BSD-init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historic aspects (e.g. because I don't know nothing more: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to do a machine on system V Init, without a new installation and new format. that's why you need to ensure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs also from BSD init that the configuration files in a sub-folders of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this file is called rc.sysinit and following other file:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basic services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services include no such items such as setserial, which will only start at rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie between / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't need a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something to do something to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for various places after the programme init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is listed in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look inside the second column and probably realize that the pre-set runlevel 3 is possible. if you want to change it / etc / inittab of hand, then you can repair all the system, then you come to resting the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the right scripts? if you enter -l enter in rc3.d, then you're probably something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this file is no real files. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">As starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that there is a argument as starting and stop. you can start this scripts actually from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would read the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K comes stop called. if it incorporates a S, the script will be called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to create a simple type, machines for many purposes. I might have & eg; a server -lap level, that can only run httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. I may also have a user -Runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say trivial: simply draw one entry from the range of the available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts between runleveln postpone or the position within a level, leaving the entry of its original stlevel (or his position), but this is only going to pull out an entry from the range of disable system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">NOTE: if you are postponed in a new range. to copy it only on a new runlevel, you must select expressly copying from the menu, or even in the target range -- even then, if the same entry is already in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a updated can be not calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the remaining entries, before you can try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">NOTE: at present there is no way to restore items, which were thrown into the paper bin. be careful so.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the various workareas (available system services, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of upper and below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move a record in another round level, move it with cutting into the intermediate shelf (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with Insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a updated manual, press the button keys to switch between different fields. use the dialog button to accept the dialogue button to accept the changes, or press Esc to verify the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss we require any confirmation in the menu file, before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings will be taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have released the standard Runleveln with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine doesn't start. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default value to a reasonable value (3 should normally be okay).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution's manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type, such as system services in these distributions are, but does not comply with the configuration for proprietary policy programs, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you're using a different distribution: check if all configuration files are available (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are just no news if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send us more about the runlevel to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">These documentation refers to & user; 1.0. using this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & user, it's enough to read the chapter adjustment from & user.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have done changes you have to save you. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or record storage in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user's; is an easy application. the main window consists of two boxes, user and user troops. to edit, select the desired users or the desired group with double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog for User or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some map cards are represented only if you have extended system settings. only if you have limited adjustments (Quota) for users, if you can pre-use individual settings. additional card cards appear, if shadow -passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd can be installed as in BSD-Unixen.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password ticket is appears if shadow -passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd can be installed as in BSD -Unixen.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if necessary for at least one can be activated (Quota) and initialized (recognizable to the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, the limited restrictions can be changed in KB.</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually adjusted for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups informed about the group corresponding to the user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, find in the field of Primitive Group. furthermore, the user can mark the user in other groups, by using this in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features a list of all users. to add one user to the group, marking this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add one user or a group, select from the menu user or group or click on the matching set of tool bar. the edit or deleting of the selected users or the selected group works.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can add the LILO-Bootmanager, remove the boot password, remove the time to the booting of the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove operating systems, remove operating systems, change and more.</seg>
