although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live for the first time there .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is excep@@ tionally large .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have read on American music , American writ@@ ers and its sports .
in fact , this country had a great pro@@ found effect on me that I became mainly due to a American film journalist .
when a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the aw@@ esome D@@ enzel Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered by Julia Roberts as a Jura student , who covered the Supreme Court of oil , who wanted to do his interest .
I was prison@@ er .
Free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was &apos; s , as if the absolute truth is , for@@ got anything else , this is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose variety can be so welcoming that you are always that you are , and it is easy to find in a community of equality people .
I had even written a very weak love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the stran@@ ger and rac@@ ism this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of its asc@@ ending is for me , as he is dealing with his engag@@ ements .
he never stops behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he th@@ inks like a former colle@@ ague , and explains only publicly his convic@@ tion for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women .
nevertheless , the people are re@@ acted to his statements and be@@ aten him in swe@@ ars for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won in the repub@@ lican elections , was the highest number , which ever achieved by the Party of nom@@ in@@ ized candidate .
I was l@@ ingu@@ ished .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ lot , I asked me ?
I could cause Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers not acc@@ ord with people in line , which I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism , people from all over the world , a deep gl@@ asting man , with whom I could keep me about Islam and his past .
also voted &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er , created by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; not part of the world .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met us at our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours thus to watch the &quot; Phoenix Sun@@ s &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance is also found in contrast to the gener@@ osity , which I strug@@ gling with Sandy B@@ ahr from the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who was treated me like their son .
it still works with the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es that helped me with much patience and grace to me , and my colleagues helped us to conc@@ iled the complex@@ ity of the American life .
then Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kathr@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who have helped me a lot of my career .
these people and those caused by her short@@ ened values found my love to America .
while carrying out his way to the nom@@ inate repub@@ lican Pre@@ sidential candidate , they subscri@@ bed to me a stop and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pre@@ sidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the med@@ itation with the idea that people have voted for tr@@ ump , because they were either his rac@@ ism and Fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were willing to watch these things , almost the heart broke .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to draw the tr@@ ump sum vot@@ ers as grass .
people to arrange , said one of my friends , exactly what has led us to this situation .
that is super@@ fic@@ ially and respec@@ t@@ less and suggest@@ s a capability to understand those who act on a different kind and way .
it shows the people that their concerns and fe@@ ars about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
could it be that these vot@@ ers are , of which most know are , for Tr@@ ump , because they want to win the control of a country that she dis@@ appointed it ?
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who comm@@ ented the cru@@ el decision to take a man with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differ@@ ently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. of SC . : as much as &quot; re@@ j@@ ection of the White and whi@@ che@@ ash , what a lot means such as pain @-@ trau@@ ma ) , as the Great Van Jones named , did exactly what happened in America so great .
millions people over the world appreci@@ ated the American Ideal - no matter whether my@@ th or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have seen , America is every welcome .
because this country chose the president , twice the son of a Ken@@ o , his story , as he says , now@@ here in the world would be possible .
however , Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s choice is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says : to Hell to Hell , religion and the whole term of Pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the Americas , after 9 / 11 , the white man will say again on Ru@@ der , they say .
with all of whom I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manif@@ estation to Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the human quantity .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the amount answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; I felt the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos will take place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out , and their voices were loud .
&quot; if anyone who is not so is like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a voice and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t it to your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was appointed .
the country that had fallen his son , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all people who look like Mr. Khan , could no find no place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero church in the Province of O@@ ax@@ aca in the town of O@@ ax@@ aca in the city of Cat@@ a@@ ura in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca ?
that the music that played at both locations is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , who lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a great gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but wor@@ lds away from the nearby pre@@ colonial Ru@@ ins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years now , the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music Festival ) plays in the community : one of children and adults consist of sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments with their musical instruments .
a school school with 100 students is become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , which is located in one of the oo@@ rest provinces Mexican , is known for their drugs @-@ ab@@ use and the ban@@ den violence .
however , this was changed after a random meeting with a French pilots , who started a musical project and commanded the youth so much hope .
the young band members take their oblig@@ ations to the music group very serious , the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run home and immediately after lunch running them through the dust of its great passion .
they always come and watch with brilliant eyes and play in the bust@@ le you for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from Mül@@ l
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practi@@ cally located on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ un@@ ción in Par@@ agu@@ ays capital - on instruments that are made from re@@ valuation waste materials :
music with re@@ prepared instruments that consist of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under the direction of Fav@@ io Ch@@ á@@ vez began to walk parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ it@@ ise viol@@ ines , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double bass@@ es , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , trombones and percussion , which were all produced from the gar@@ bage .
the re@@ pertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fav@@ io Ch@@ á@@ vez remember@@ ed a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the starting time :
first it was very difficult because we had no space to re@@ hear@@ sed , and we did not hes@@ itate to contact the parents in the gar@@ bage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact her parents , because many of them did not live with their children .
this changed when Fav@@ io was shown something that he had never seen before : a waste came out of waste .
today there is a complete orchestra , which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
documentation of the &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates approximately one billion tonnes of waste .
those who live with him and from him are the trou@@ bles - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Par@@ agu@@ ay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra by his in@@ spir@@ ing spectac@@ le from the gar@@ bage music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team work successfully fought the illegal fishing industry
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that combat the wild illegal fishing .
this entry , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use .
in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already been operated in liber@@ ian waters of illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were raised to this way , and have little gen@@ ds to welcome a leg@@ als of this kind to their coastal welcome .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Sey@@ ch@@ elles mobil@@ ized rapidly against the ship . they refused to put one of their har@@ bo@@ urs and refused to share a fishing permit to him .
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries . he is part of a team that discovered the ship , and followed .
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the region . it was not managed to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of a p@@ illage of fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative which protects the criminal tra@@ ine@@ ers and resources , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , in 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop , illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagas@@ car , which had been driven by the Prime Minister out of its waters .
&quot; &quot; so we have eight countries that are even@@ ly and work together . they are facing each other , where it &apos;s illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of Pe@@ w CH@@ ARI@@ TABLE Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers FISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regul@@ ated by definition : what is taken , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to make it extremely difficult , so the illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
due to the estimated def@@ aul@@ ting laws , using the specific hab@@ it@@ ats and types of protected , the illegal fishing systems can be protected , which have a del@@ ic@@ ate balance .
however , during their actions against illegal fishing hur@@ dle , and also through the Schn@@ eck@@ er@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions are now in real @-@ time , with fol@@ dable to FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there may include the individual countries , for example lists exist@@ ent lic@@ ences , news for susp@@ ected activities or details that had noticed during a liability or read .
fish @-@ i per@@ sec@@ uted the activities of ships also very atten@@ tively , if these are move on the open lake , with satellite data .
this enables the authorities to know ships to know ships which in b@@ anned regions - about such a ship shows that a boat loads on other ships on the other ships .
in the ide@@ als , such studies show whether the participating ships have a fish roller , where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal off@@ ense .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can be denied on basis of this information about the acceptance of such vessels in their har@@ bo@@ urs , meaning that the ships could not be able to sell their cargo , as opposed to the figures of pen@@ al@@ ties , as in case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a significant financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal catch is not wor@@ th@@ while .
and this is what we want to reach is &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , conduc@@ ting director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a mountain @-@ company dedicated to fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also featured FISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created , estimated to win 20 million USD each year , who lose the eight members of the Net@@ working H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fisher@@ men who enter in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing industry , due to the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . under these , those of Il@@ legal Fischer .
among their practices and actions , as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ feit licensed papers , specification of imag@@ ination names , the fishing protected species and the fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ lasting control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she could not say a ship illegal and a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ als tried to complete the FISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investig@@ ations of susp@@ ects .
it has been dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating networks , which was counter@@ feit lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has per@@ sec@@ uted ships and found it .
due to his collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , FISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; some of our investig@@ ations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system to help the FISH @-@ i , susp@@ ected ships of precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed continually , helps to sn@@ ails the illegal vessels to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; the Il@@ legal Fischer use very ra@@ ff@@ ed techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Ch@@ ef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , a N@@ RO which offers well with f@@ ish@@ eries and FISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships switch to automatically identify their automatic identification systems , where@@ with them can &apos;t be used by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that links the various information gathered together . it is to help FISH @-@ i to help trans@@ cri@@ min@@ ating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but , FISH @-@ i &apos;s Team African nations are actually impact on the und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes it .
recently , Sky@@ Truth is opened together with Google and the sea protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by the position of each single @-@ fol@@ dable ship@@ es worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; merg@@ ed with neigh@@ bo@@ urs to get a better picture of it , who is what where does - that &apos;s just sense , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance to join them to use their resources to exam@@ ine their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w CH@@ ARI@@ TABLE Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run a global system for the per@@ secution of ships .
there are evidence that FISH @-@ i &apos;s Activ@@ ities are not only cri@@ min@@ ers , but they are also going down .
ships that previously made earlier without licence and hardly any consequ@@ ence we know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of them participated in FISH @-@ i involved a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , ever since fishing boats are more licenses .
after FISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board of drag , their use is pro@@ hib@@ ited .
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries noticed this successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is strongly that we have become other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we dis@@ appear every year several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries have joined to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force , since exactly the same model such as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with safety is the aim to make more such initi@@ atives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent affili@@ land Somalia report its first major tri@@ umph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under false flag and was not only used to go without license and were b@@ anned .
the ship was still in@@ hib@@ ited in b@@ anned waters that are reserved for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the niche of dimensional rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof of the oc@@ eans works in the entire world . Emma Bry@@ ce is fre@@ el@@ ance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the topic of the environment , technology and diet .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to join the tom@@ bs in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine town of C@@ ó@@ rd@@ oba , in Argentina .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said within the frame of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba for his father .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not find his life .
starting with the office , such names like his father contri@@ bute to the brut@@ al military operations in La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
he kept the family secre@@ tly for 34 years .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret magical .
as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t know that it is man@@ ip@@ ulated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a th@@ ief , fol@@ klore and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was Deputy Commander of the secret service department of 141 in La Per@@ la .

this is not the history of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pression that is charged with torture in the 158 cases , torture and murder in nearly 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced in the course of the fact that he had experienced in the course of the years that he had experienced a young father against his own father .
its history shows what great power is a par@@ ent about his child and like this child chose a way of salvation .
from the Spor@@ thalle to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I was often looking for us into the sports hall . I had a little girl with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black and white photo , and called me to identify my bo@@ y@@ friend .
he said ,
you are a si@@ bl@@ ong , but you hit you with one of the ER@@ P .
pas@@ sport watch it , that they will not lead you a day , and I will save you .
the Ab@@ bre@@ viation ER@@ P stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ ebl@@ o , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labor Party .
therefore he commanded me to go back into the Sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be fool@@ ish .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for example , my father had passed me .
on the military base I had to destroy the papers that had heard prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University connections , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ ility material , books , just everything .

&quot; the prisoners are tort@@ ured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he made me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get off . he led me to a Bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - simply all possible - standing .
everything was st@@ olen .
he gave me a small bou@@ quet of a blank@@ et with a blank@@ et of a blank@@ et . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump in silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the st@@ olen objects were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he retired on an open space and said :
the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
I entered and saw a couch , tort@@ ured on humans .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they for@@ tified the one end of an Kab@@ els . the other end was fast@@ ened at the body of the person which was straight there .
they are rare with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to bed , over@@ threw him with water and pursu@@ ed him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ italia .

the st@@ iff was dr@@ unk there ... like a dir@@ ty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same sm@@ ell came out of his room .
I recognized the sm@@ ell immediately and I was clear that the sm@@ ell of a body in need is not .
I never forget this sm@@ ell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a man can do a lot ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were b@@ ursed .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were gre@@ eted with the face - all were on hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the intervention , people still rise to the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed that I said to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ilt thou so , Ass@@ loch ? &quot;
I have enco@@ unter@@ ed , &quot; Why have you brought me good ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and buried by soldiers .
I know that , because my father told her house .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man and killed there .
( according to the survival of civilians ) Jorge Rom@@ ero was indicted by the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a leads the director of the La Per@@ la mem@@ orial through the former fol@@ ds .
the way , where you come here , is the way that came from here .
if you look at the map that they took about this way and tort@@ ured for the first time .
here were changed to their names and was assigned to a number of trial rec@@ ess .
when they survived the torture of torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the above , that they should be moved .
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for calcul@@ ating human beings and dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought me all possible things with home .
at that time , I had no idea that the &quot; war@@ yield &quot; - as they knew it - was .
but when I was later to the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear that war yield a bay@@ onet or perhaps the military bases , which one receives an enemy who fought an enemy .

but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... and then it is not a war@@ fare , v@@ and@@ alism .
that is the@@ ft .
I &apos;ve always asked me like my father , the leader of the security forces , in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand .
I was also a officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never enjoyed it to ste@@ al in a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do .
once he called me a cri@@ min@@ als and I answered : and you did meet cars on the road ?
you are no cri@@ min@@ er ?
he explo@@ ded about rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far away , I &apos;ll find you and place you .
in addition we need no other !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then on which I had a jacket and a rolling stock of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he didn &apos;t have clothes with home .
at that time , the defence asked me , a co @-@ disappeared during this crime . I said no problem , they can lay me on load what they wanted .
I was anyway , to speak out .
&quot; the dis@@ appe@@ arances of the Ly@@ re is the last dis@@ gu@@ ardi@@ ans &apos;
now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you have children only once children , we know the value of a life .
one developed further and det@@ ects that it is false to kill .
I even went to say to say :
so well , you have joined the dictatorship during the dictatorship . but what dis@@ appear to dis@@ appear ?
why children kid@@ ding ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
she was as our pet , almost as a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always turned the question : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ?
they could simply take them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what to dis@@ appear their bodies ?
had these people not too families who could have been handed over to their remains ?
the dis@@ appe@@ arances of the cor@@ pse is the last de@@ parts , which can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they rev@@ amped machines to elim@@ inate the extinc@@ t remains of the prisoners .
they were m@@ ashed and somewhere else - no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ia .
just I just told the truth about 20 crime - including my father .
the thought , in my father , was originated during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him prec@@ eding for all of the gre@@ etings , which I had to see .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I did not have killed . &quot;
I felt with comp@@ as@@ sion and asked me when the entire Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian fe@@ el@@ ings , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended it , actually was good .
then I cried :
how can you say something to me ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
you have committed aw@@ ful crime , committed me as a child , and you didn &apos;t have a child .
he said , &quot; Oh well , I don &apos;t show me . &quot;
exactly that I did .
in 2010 , I ref@@ unded the first message .
I finally knew that he was a cr@@ us@@ her .
nobody can be told me that I am vo@@ re@@ ingen@@ ommen . I finally said to my own father .

an translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fur@@ rowing motor@@ cycli@@ sts &quot;
the sign with the translation error in Kyoto , in which one can extend his guide .
the photo was widespread in the social media .
mach@@ ining of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers have been a newly opened centre in which one can extend its leader in the last month witnesses of a very particularly miss@@ ile translation .
on a sign the Japanese word , the &quot; older &quot; driver &quot; was resol@@ ved , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means , perhaps - maybe even with evil back@@ rest &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terri@@ fic motor@@ bik@@ ers &quot; was translated .
the false translation was from 1 @-@ 20 September to electronic ads in the input and in the building itself .
the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into social media .
the mistake had been the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a population of Ky@@ otos , it was also that the loc@@ al@@ tim@@ ings made it carefully .
the Kyoto daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n daily was :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this shows that no one has read the translation .
this is a reward for older people and in an international city like the Kyoto , &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the def@@ ective English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; terri@@ ble generation &quot; ( German : &quot; fe@@ ared car driver &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also the program was not very correct called &quot; Elder Phase &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture for the translation error . still , it declared that the error was already in the text , they did not have been tested by the trans@@ lat@@ ors and that the translation was not checked before it was published .
a b@@ logger was reported as follows :
&quot; it really sorry that older people felt through the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News is slightly more detailed with the phenom@@ enon of the &quot; terri@@ fic &quot; elder motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terri@@ ble &quot; has been listed as an un@@ reasonable description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , which are cultiv@@ ated in accid@@ ents , but are reason for wor@@ ry .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture for example , 1.9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accid@@ ents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a proportion of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 803 from a total of 11,@@ 850 accid@@ ents .
thus their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accid@@ ents have fallen in total , the share of senior citizens caused the same period in the same period .
the nam@@ ing not called Rep@@ orter brought in to Yah@@ oo released version of the article comments to the light , show that some Japanese are appar@@ ently against older drivers :
the article on Yah@@ oo on the translation error received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terri@@ fic motor@@ bik@@ ers &quot; ) about do not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; Thus is not the translation is not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there is no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; in all Asia it is so common
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bi@@ z@@ arre error in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation are diverse .
you need two major skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transl@@ ate him into the target language .
the latter requires the active statement of the target language - something that &apos;s in the womb . in general , the convic@@ tion is that transl@@ ator in the target language - not in the initial language - native language should be .
thus , a French mother tongue should transl@@ ate from English to French , not from the French transl@@ ator into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies emplo@@ y no employees with English as a native language to transl@@ ate into English . this may be lack@@ ing understanding for the transl@@ ating , cost @-@ green or the relatively small number of English mot@@ ives , who learn Japanese to with@@ al .
some companies that have no foreign employees have been able to produce pe@@ ac@@ eke@@ eping . then , the Japanese people will be able to transl@@ ate transl@@ ator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the ver@@ aging and smo@@ other phr@@ ases which can be created by machine translation , show that this technology is still no human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages quite particular .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also the rams are often used for T @-@ Shirts or bags , only from stylish reasons - not to be understood or understood not .

translation error may be acceptable or che@@ er as je@@ well@@ ery or at least harm@@ less . but of large enterprises or from the government who have to ensure a higher standards , you can expect a more serious translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a serial source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and Impres@@ sions on the Internet and Television
main page of the port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to PR@@ EN@@ SA y Soc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7th , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users that they would have no access to the online station Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other user states , that the Internet out@@ comes of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV . no longer be accessible .
other Online Transmitter from the prot@@ ests in Carac@@ as , organised by op@@ positioning groups , who res@@ ist the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the prot@@ ests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament on the executive and the Supreme Court themselves .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection is inspec@@ ted and receiving the Us@@ ers , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ ith : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN .
it seems that Internet@@ pages Venezu@@ el@@ an Provi@@ der again imprisoned .
that is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
special offers such as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ern with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media are trad@@ emar@@ ked since 2014 in the reporting of prot@@ ests . then threatened the Commission for telec@@ omm@@ unication with fin@@ es and closing statements , when the Commission would continue to report this as &quot; Call for Viol@@ ence &quot; ans@@ wering .
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still favour@@ able to buy two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that only Viv@@ op@@ lay will not be accessible by a pl@@ enti@@ ve of the domain name System ( DNA ) , but also two more online channels . this also affects the website , which transfers its meetings to the National Assembly .
earlier research instit@@ utes of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group of digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet suppliers can use DNA . it is a technique through which the DNA server inqu@@ ired of a specific dom@@ ains .
if a website is block@@ ed by the DNS , the server is missing or denied the request to such a web site .
we confirm a DNS @-@ Sper@@ re : @ el@@ capit@@ li@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ locked canal , the broadcast on Thursday , April 6 , was set out when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ eram@@ an El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who was transferred to Carac@@ as live in prison .
Flo@@ res was be@@ aten , while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , as well as reported that the government will regul@@ ates the internet connections , thus the Ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ern is increasingly popular on the current events in the country .
in Par@@ agu@@ ay , many girls will become a slave to get a training
Tina Alvar@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ ad@@ ita for a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina was fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts other cri@@ ad@@ itas , that &apos;s exactly as they were victims of mis@@ use and dis@@ cri@@ mination .

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report of Kur@@ dish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying c@@ ows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and released .
Tina Alvar@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a budget , in whom they were not together with the family that lived there , dinner .
shortly before her studies at the university , she returned to the house , and heard how the owner of the house was full of pri@@ de over them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
those who became a little , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Alvar@@ eng@@ a was never treated in this house as a daughter .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas called in Par@@ agu@@ ay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school .
the shop is very simple : a great family with little money goes to their min@@ t @-@ year @-@ old daughter , or her min@@ der@@ y daughter to another , en@@ rich@@ est family . in the sw@@ ap , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , is that the children will be un@@ counted for count@@ less days , which will never be paid and sacrific@@ ed by ab@@ use and ab@@ use - and all that can &apos;t be able within the context of a contract that cannot be raised .
in Par@@ agu@@ ay , this regarded as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go , in Par@@ agu@@ ay , due to its participation and acceptance of large parts of society , and despite abund@@ ant compl@@ aints by human rights organisations .
after completion of their studies , Alvar@@ eng@@ a lived a few years for an organization that batt@@ les for the rights of the boys and girls .
in particular , she said with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected testim@@ on@@ ies , re@@ bu@@ ked and p@@ ran@@ gers .
she tried to call things in name , for the feeling of grat@@ itude that will be vacc@@ inated in principle .
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double val@@ idity , &quot; explains Alvar@@ eng@@ a .
there is one part of the family , whom her daughter in the faith , that she may improve their training to improve their position in society and &quot; something from himself &quot; can be translated to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which takes up the girl with the faith , just@@ ified that they would give someone to a chance that would never be hun@@ gry and perhaps would be hun@@ gry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
if the girl is har@@ ass@@ ed , his family will find out many years later .
sometimes they never know them .
in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenom@@ enon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a vision .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came into hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body was f@@ ain@@ ted with her body . shortly after he died .
she was 14 years old .
she was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita household in the former military service of Tom@@ ás Ferreira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , which worked as the civil office at the inhabitants of the inhabitants .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in V@@ aqu@@ ería , a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ un@@ ción .
at the end of January 2016 , Ferreira will spread as long as one stick on Mar@@ ín , until they suffered le@@ thal inju@@ ries .
this should be the last pun@@ ishment in the life of the young girls .
some days later , the media reported about the incid@@ ent .
they emphas@@ ized that the ad@@ orn@@ ed child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNI@@ CEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society in the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go responsible for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of s@@ la@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen people came to protest together and challeng@@ ing that there was no further Carolina in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
in Par@@ agu@@ ay , more c@@ ows are registered as children , &quot; ordered Tina Alvar@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which the conditions boys and girls live .
the neigh@@ bo@@ urs of the married couples and almost 60 civil society demands a gener@@ ous investigation of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Ferreira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of girls who had to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
if the case comes before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be a case for the first time in the history of Par@@ agu@@ ays a case from Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go before the court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only explo@@ ited as a work force , they live also isolated from other girls in her old age .
Tina Alvar@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the color , in which her father worked , bank@@ ru@@ pt@@ cy to register and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go to work and began to sell money on the street or to make money at the market .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital of As@@ un@@ ción .
in the house of their emplo@@ yer , Alvar@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
they had to spend the time so that you still stayed at the time for learning .
she arose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their emplo@@ yers .
Fri@@ days for example , clean@@ ed the fridge , p@@ utz@@ te the living room , polished furniture and des@@ ir@@ ate the soil .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learning .
the more they were finished with the learning , the more leisure time she had .
yet this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their emplo@@ yer .
Alvar@@ eng@@ a says that she had to be hun@@ gry , but got not unlimited food . &quot; I was able to re@@ cover more books from the library of the household of the household as food from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the hous@@ eholder , a former military and symp@@ ath@@ y of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who belonged to the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in 1954 to 1989 .
at some evening of the household Alvar@@ eng@@ a Alvar@@ eng@@ a in addition to him and conduc@@ ting articles from the opposition of Opp@@ os@@ itions such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ ebl@@ o &quot; .
in fact , he tried to con@@ vin@@ ce them to give the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held it for intelligent , but not yet with her . &quot; the household had found someone who heard it , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t allowed me to visit my family , because they said the opinion , that I would say there again &quot; poor employees &quot; would say that Alvar@@ eng@@ a said to the indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ ani , at home again , her mother tongue would speak .
their Lord fe@@ ared the formation that they had allowed to lose her , explains them .
however , her was completely clear that they had received for everything they had paid from them , with their hard work .
in the school , Alvar@@ eng@@ a was dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; one thing that will never be spoken about nearly never , are m@@ bb@@ ing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to school if they go to school .
because the other children have parents , recogni@@ zing it immediately that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ ad@@ ita is .
I was able to invite home to my home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friendship ar@@ ises , I felt very clear that I belonged to any group .
isolation was the worst of all , &quot; Alvar@@ eng@@ a explains .

bill writes Egyptian users in soci@@ etal media , to register at the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently filed a bill to &quot; regulations regarding con@@ servation and use of social networks . &quot;
when it is accepted by Parliament , social media must register for social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law then it would be set up a place that was commissioned to provide citizens and citizens with permission to share social media .
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users would have to register on the site with their right name and staff numbers to register social networks .
will it dis@@ missed this , that could bring a pun@@ ishment of up to six months in prison or a cash bu@@ ck .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ ag@@ les and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt In@@ dependent , defines social media than &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs on the Internet and is used to communic@@ ate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is passed if it is assumed that the draft would not be able to register as the Egyptian authorities that will not register for those who are to register for those who are not able to register before the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on stage of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , member of the Law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name for a user name and a password to come by the Fire@@ wall , Facebook block@@ ed the Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to make a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those would be to submit to the Egypti@@ ans and Egypti@@ ans to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it &apos;s not known to know that such plans exist .

Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technologies ( in German &quot; Executive Committee &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights , &quot; ) told Global Vo@@ ices :
I will be strong at the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
according to my opinion , it is so important that as they are certain physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take her , then it means that they may apply a strong monitoring system to apply for citizens , or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people , and also to execute a ju@@ di@@ cial process .
this is techn@@ ically realistic - but in Egypt is all possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the design will initially be discussed at the Leg@@ isl@@ ative of Parliament and the Constitutional Court before it goes into the plen@@ ary debate .
whether his acceptance and di@@ fication is successful , or not , the design &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , whose sens@@ es shall be maxim@@ ized and ensu@@ red that no other f@@ ool has been present on the image area . &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .

up in the mountains of the Iraqi region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Tier@@ sch@@ ütz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza , and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq had to protect the spiritual Per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the le@@ op@@ ard le@@ op@@ ards , which include Africa and Asia , belong to the Per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ m@@ entation of their hab@@ itat and as they always find less pre@@ y .
why is this specific type of Leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ies is in the Kur@@ dish ec@@ os@@ ystem , &quot; and the health and the thought of the ec@@ os@@ ystems has also depends on that a large pre@@ b@@ tier is present .
the prob@@ ability to see a Per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wild bo@@ gg@@ an is low and goes to zero . as the team in the video therefore , that they have a recording of a great cat in the camera , the R@@ aza breaks out pleasure in pure pleasure .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made by the North East Japan were affected by the life of those who were affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima had trig@@ gered the cat@@ astrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Pre@@ f@@ ecture Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast who had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbour@@ ing pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all coastal towns of the country card .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima living in the Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima pre@@ f@@ ecture had to leave their homes for 160 000 inhabitants .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows a local view that had been reached after six years later to re@@ build the life of the local companies .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese revi@@ val authority as well as a survey results of the affected itself .
the housing situation in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that by the end of December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned replacement homes ( in , ar@@ rang , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) was completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could have been finished here 80 percent of the planned replacement .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima forms the final light to around 70 percent .
for example , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by containers ( in the cat@@ aly@@ tic converter , k@@ az@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) are conf@@ id@@ ated .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in containers .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima still life in emergency , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had been successful in a successful months . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated that were dis@@ placed after the disaster in containers , were moved in final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by the disaster , their gates have again opened up to December 2016 , which strength@@ ens nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have been restored into operation , in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima only 30 percent of the fisher@@ men have been restored its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ ic accident , have moved into three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in agriculture in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could re@@ produce 93 percent of his agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farmers in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the farm@@ land in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
it is un@@ likely that only one epis@@ ode of nuclear war@@ n is about 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , lie in the &quot; nuclear stop zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the tourism has recovered again , but also the Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima remains far away .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima should only be 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reported that since the disaster almost half of the coastal population , it is more difficult to earn their hab@@ itat .
is the local population prepared for the next major earth@@ qu@@ akes ?
in order to determine a complete image , the newspaper resulted in numerous respon@@ si@@ bilities under the native population and under the ev@@ acu@@ ated . she asked them about the state of the re @-@ building and even as their in@@ dig@@ nation can be changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article explains the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a quest@@ ionn@@ aire to bring over the ts@@ un@@ ami consci@@ ousness under the native population in experience .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the population resident measures taken measures taken in order to be prepared in the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough for dis@@ ast@@ ers of cat@@ astroph@@ es was done .
as to those who stands the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima pre@@ f@@ ecture had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated
in its issue as the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated aus Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima did not only experience the massive earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , even witness of the worst , cat@@ ast@@ rous phen@@ ols , atom@@ ic accident often had to experience in Japan .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , nearly 63 000 people were moved into areas outside pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , in permanent subst@@ itute houses .
after the 2017 stand , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ phen@@ ols , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated , they are still affected in containers for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima . this is about construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .

with the introduction of the Law of Álvar@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso stu@@ ds almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the middle of Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
in fact , the Volks@@ de Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i , which is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ equ@@ e , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no not@@ able sug@@ ar@@ able sugar .
it is two years ago when the activities were produced in the sugar cane factories .
after reaching the sugar cane , the sugar cane in the region still lost , and the factory lost and after its facilities , until only the frame of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 272 workers had to be found .
some changes the work .
other re@@ signed and p@@ end@@ ors every day to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a solo database veter@@ an , which is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis is smo@@ ked in the sugar cane industry .
he heard that there are in the east of the sugar cane factories , which have been returned into operation after a long time , because they were preserved .
that was something , what he was not expected .
N@@ ene remin@@ ds right that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich will receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resist@@ ive the pl@@ agues , the case of soci@@ alism , low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , bad administration and climate change .
in 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 amount .
the message would have been some decades ago for the country , but the poor harvest were no re@@ vers@@ ity .
why was the Cub@@ an Zucker@@ cane industry switched off ?
the old train st@@ iff was already better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the contam@@ ination of the sugar cane industry was a economic need : the 155 sugar cane factories were techn@@ ically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
mot@@ ives , which led to such measures were the small productivity of the sugar cane and the refuge in the global market .
non@@ eth@@ eless , the sugar rate rose before approximately one decade .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; agricultural exports &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the economic and food organization of the United Nations .
if the current production has reached the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar @-@ export amounts to roughly 85 million dollars for the country .
not all worked fine
today &apos;s day , the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro declared the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ and@@ ero .
since then the process of re@@ struc@@ turing in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the stand@@ still consisted of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full moon for further education .
the same thing in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i on May 14th , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as it is known as a soldier , is talking about the closure of the factory , the word that he is repeated on most repeated , &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost any respon@@ dents have the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first attemp@@ ted year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially collected in order to be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed by the address and the date .
all of them were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could be addressed every dis@@ closure .
since there was the responsibility of responsibility and letters were still more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of two years for the set of the factory , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , in@@ sured in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the stand@@ still of the factory , whose construction he helped him .
with each part , he removed his dis@@ man@@ t@@ led one of his 31 years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work environment was deleted .
in many cases , there were no altern@@ atives for the labour and services that were generated in the communities in which they were created .
we will never know if the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , then the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw that he was guaranteed for the regions of their factories , whose factories have not been in operation for five years .
the population of the population for closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane has been extrac@@ ted only by stomach .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the referendum of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i learned that many things will change , but not always to better if a factory will be closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better , when they started , they also heard it , they also heard the road to asph@@ alted , this dis@@ advantage also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they were given to spare parts .
without future inspec@@ tions , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the assembly .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still im@@ posing .
in the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty Ern@@ ed the old soldier a pension of two p@@ aus@@ ing Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and cle@@ ar@@ er voice , is no subsequent person , nevertheless he gives the lies that told him not .
they have been working for ten years .
N@@ ene is going to be 65 years old in Ren@@ der , not because it is missing at force , but because he is bit@@ terly .

first Nations youth use hip @-@ hop to express yourself and get its own culture

photo uses approval of N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations @-@ Communities in Canada are bus@@ y with topics that are important for them . they are using hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an tour have been working directly to schools and youth centers since 2014 , for youth groups , s@@ ong@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live recording .
the original workshops were directed by David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and lived in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree movements and then with the C@@ ree Hip Hop @-@ hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop increases that the young participating in soci@@ etal issues such as &quot; cultural identity , language , med@@ itation , love , self @-@ acceptable , &quot; or whatever they can be found in the sense .
these questions are in@@ spiration for songs and videos , in which the adol@@ esc@@ ents are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations in Canadian province British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Ne@@ bras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Y@@ oo in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation , tells us the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of Tr@@ änen &quot; in which almost two do@@ zen were mostly indi@@ genous young women or murdered .
cases were not clar@@ ified .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to determine how important of traditional customs and customs , despite influ@@ ences through the glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in Indian languages , although the adol@@ esc@@ ents of the first Nations is not always mut@@ il@@ ingu@@ istic .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ st@@ i C@@ ree First nation will have taken the ref@@ rain on C@@ ree .
the young people involved a little help of Gary Jol@@ ly by the North@@ stars Hip Hop hop group who lov@@ eth them a St@@ atic in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Fac@@ e@@ book@@ side of N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an is available in the heading , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into English :
sometimes I feel when I &apos;m interested in me
but I &apos;m looking for my days on the earth
this is the day when you will take our terror
because we lost our way as a youth in our life
but I believe that we will take us a day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
so they can grow and as well as our youth .
so they can do that , what the Creator is determined

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant in plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , what exactly is shown on the menu card , close to the entrance of sho@@ ck@@ pur@@ u ( in particular , &quot; Plast@@ ic models of the dishes &quot; ) are shown by each food that served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry which dedic@@ ates to manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tus@@ oter district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small enterprises that produce those plastic dishes , which make the German film@@ maker Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a in front of more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually , they don &apos;t know them . a new trend turns it today in normal mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome published the b@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual phr@@ ases with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ gi@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic dishes decorated cell tapes , as they are shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial fo@@ od@@ stuff were changed to kit@@ sch@@ emes collec@@ ting objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ant rank@@ ings :

in reports and foreign media about the inf@@ am@@ ous struggle against the drug trade &quot; in Mexico the mis@@ eries and killed just regularly in statistics . however , this sp@@ ir@@ oning is not against the extent of the human trag@@ edy that fight against this fight .
the reporting on Dro@@ gen@@ bos@@ ses as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the b@@ oss of Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , p@@ ushed the stories of conflict in the conflict in the background .
on the day after a violent incid@@ ent , someone hardly anyone who have lear@@ nt to the grapes , or to the municip@@ alities that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind every body , behind every bone appe@@ aring in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories paying parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose w@@ ounds may never be he@@ al .
therefore , the Mexican telec@@ ast portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co is created the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trade , &quot; ) , that a voice should give a voice , and stories of people tell the fight between the pro@@ secution of the authorities and cart@@ ella .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
we didn &apos;t join us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more sensitive .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug tra@@ ff@@ ers and entire municip@@ alities therefore need many kilometres , to buy some such as milk .
the pain of Vic@@ tims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( german : &quot; how fear life changed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guad@@ alu@@ pe , a father who is looking for every weekend of secret gra@@ ves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Rod@@ r@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father in only one day , her four sisters , her husband and two their nephew lost .
priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare for us today to the task that we have put us to go and to gra@@ ves after people who loved us . &quot;
Guad@@ alu@@ pe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th , he should again be back , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , which is here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but which gets not paid them out because that a d@@ ying certificate will be missed .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the ed@@ itors of &quot; Apr@@ ating a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t need to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we need to show the international community the conflict , the cer@@ emon@@ ies and government leadership .
the project is based on Stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extrac@@ ts from the stories .
KY@@ HB , a reader from Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central alm@@ ex@@ iko .
your contribution remin@@ ds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form them :
I have now know illness and sens@@ ational journalists now for some years .
I come every day to newspaper c@@ ki@@ os@@ ken and see the title pages with pictures that are actually only from a text@@ book for cri@@ min@@ ology or re@@ jects of specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I have the feeling , as if I am the only , or sad . it works , as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to the body .
I can &apos;t be equal or as normal as normal .
she writes :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year old co@@ usin will think that he is great . and it is not normal to hear people songs about the &quot; hel@@ mets &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me is that , when they would have lost to those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened to them .
I see our weak@@ ness if Stories to naked numbers in one statistics .
the crime unemployment of people is un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appe@@ arances were just@@ ified by 43 students in a neigh@@ bour subur@@ b that they were afraid . &quot;
I think it attemp@@ ts to talk to them that they are spar@@ ed from such trag@@ e@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of pressing in the main city area : like a family with thre@@ ats , &quot; it describes how Ar@@ med the Month for the month money from their business pres@@ ets , until it was not only destroyed the business , but also her family had torn apart .
you think all that you lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain is never stopped , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear will come back , when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
each further we are removed from each other , the better .
she completed its report with words :
we want to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know how to kill you or kill you .
I asked me in this terri@@ ble days , if I would like to solve my deep@@ est fe@@ el@@ ings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten about how to live . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ g@@ otten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the generation called generation . &quot;
in the introduction , he casts questions about how : who car@@ es for a child &apos;s wife and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ?
how is it , in a settlement at the out@@ skirts of the most dangerous cities Mexican ?
he is not like the other boys of his age , whose parents will take care of them .
Bry@@ an is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had to kill himself as a egg , potatoes , tortillas , tortillas and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine fol@@ ds on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boys for the whole life of violence and had to learn to live .
when he was five years old , told him that his mother disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had already past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the blo@@ ody body of his father saw that of armed men had been shot by armed men .
when Bry@@ an was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was like this :
Bry@@ an was born in 2006 , as violence by the organized crimes and battle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous cities in the world by the number of mor@@ atorium according to the data of the office of public security and government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Prosecutor &apos;s Office 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only some of hundreds of stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and moved into the soul of the country .
just a few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines . this project remin@@ ds us to those who have not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ cod@@ ata in 2015 , whose aim is to set more complex information behind the drug trade that has shown the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages , to which he may contain pictures , which is shown on violence .
the fact check is important at a moment , in which it goes to lift a rum@@ or or a f@@ ake to escape .
but how is the years after something has changed the first time ? content in social media , matter whether true or un@@ true , incl@@ ined to stand further .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terri@@ ble accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
since its first publication , it has been used since its first release , trag@@ e@@ dies to illustrated , which actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of picture and event - &quot; false Description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the Termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - den@@ y not the fact that it gives abund@@ ant coverage on events in the DR of Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it th@@ rows questions to our review to news on our desire to the pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
in 2010 , a tank wagon passed the place called S@@ ange in the East of the DR of Congo , re@@ vers@@ ed and explo@@ ded . there came 230 men &apos;s life .
after the civil war in Africa , South Africa was neg@@ lec@@ ted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become too dangerous paths of impact holes that were difficult to be@@ eing .
Trag@@ isation fell vic@@ tim to the victims of the t@@ ank@@ ers .
it was described a fire @-@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses including a cin@@ em@@ as , including a cin@@ em@@ as , who was full of people who looked for the soccer world championship .
houses burnt and wi@@ red bodies in the streets are scattered .
many people were burned to infin@@ ity .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , January 12 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the prec@@ au@@ tion form the grey scenes of this day .
the top is an example .
it shows rows of low body , which are spread over the ground during the people .
but here the story will not find her end .
over the years , the same picture was taken several times on social media , b@@ logs and other platforms , but they are not attributed to the connection of the trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what , and what do not in Nigeria and Myanmar .
on January 3 , 2015 , figh@@ ters of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ le@@ aded Nig@@ eri@@ an Ort@@ is@@ an Ort@@ ler and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye diseases reported dra@@ st@@ ically did to flee from which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down in roads and bones .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were killed .
the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count Lei@@ gh to count , &quot; said a population to Human Rights Watch .
many were ch@@ oked , shot or burned .
only from satellite images , the follow @-@ up was depic@@ ted .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the working point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from the year 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here &apos;s the picture from the DR Congo again , when it accid@@ ent@@ ally presented as a proof of the fact that the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acres of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , these ab@@ bre@@ ed use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of false activities ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image has been brought back as a vou@@ cher for measures .
another step further bring to personal comments such as this example , the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arg@@ uments .
the picture from S@@ ange appeared in conjunction with the dead@@ ly per@@ secution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rap@@ ing and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported by the Viol@@ ence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s wrote the following items such as the following descriptions of the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arab@@ ian news page , which claimed that in 2012 , the president My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an reign@@ ed , mon@@ ks and polit@@ icians have been involved in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image from DR Congo to illustrated this information .
the original contribution is to be access@@ ed here on 26 April 2017 , can be access@@ ed here .
other news organizations that AF@@ P had known as their source , but they were also attributed to His testimony , but did not make the picture from DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide range of false information
tracks of these false tracks are enough to return back to 2011 and 2012 , and actually come across all over the world .
using a &quot; um@@ de@@ cent image search , &quot; you can see how far more information limits can be exceeded .
a modified image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 pictures found that the discussed picture from DR Congo is very similar .
they come from a mixed mask , private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have reported false reports , some have attemp@@ ted to dis@@ lar@@ v@@ ae the forg@@ eries .
we have entered examples of the ab@@ bre@@ aker usage and they were associated with the respective countries , based on which page they have been published . therefore , we want to display the range clearly than by the language alone .
several examples were used from the bottom of listed countries ( which were also linked together in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be donated to the map ( on the map in orange ) :
Map : News Fr@@ ames .
other examples of false copies of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries refer to pages or server , about the examples of the f@@ ake or counter@@ feit messages are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are described according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available on inks about Tin@@ eye , probably some counter@@ part examples .
as memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Bur@@ ma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( judged by al@@ ti@@ ers and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for a miss@@ ile use of the image from the DR Congo , with one part one Twe@@ et , the symp@@ ath@@ y opposite the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand of a b@@ log@@ gers , the claims that are del@@ ayed to del@@ ig@@ itim@@ ize , since the pictures of it ab@@ bre@@ wer@@ y were used .

the government of Myanmar published a judge making it as &quot; explic@@ it@@ ly fing@@ ers News and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding regarding Myanmar . &quot;

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian @-@ orth@@ od@@ ox congregation , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo did not show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page was claimed that the president of Myanmar will have been involved in 2012 that mon@@ ks and polit@@ icians have been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and currently the picture is still included in this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 on students who had been killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explic@@ it@@ ly explained that the image is not of the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ rom@@ atic attack . &quot;
when the picture later , in connection with the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to raise the connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertil@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria br@@ anded the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo is provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , on and ext@@ ingu@@ ishing a discussion under Muslims after the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the stop to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their events took this events that took place in the name of the Isl@@ ams , a larger attention .
USA , 2015 .
the image has been recorded as a cover for the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 by the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 . but the messages that were linked together were not attacked in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after an em@@ bass@@ y that allegedly had been written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Pascal &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , in circulation , the discussion for@@ ums like this here on Vi@@ etnam@@ ese and explain it to the wrong announcement .
from the em@@ bass@@ y , in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Pascal Martos .
there are more confirmed examples of a def@@ ective use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , Netherlands and Argentina .
on other users , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ eye , but are no longer re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiop@@ ia , Sri Lanka , A@@ zer@@ bai@@ jan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ L@@ s and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and dis@@ missed them about image file in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared quite clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image may possibly be correct but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two severe them@@ es or frames ( one flo@@ ods ) , which passes by the post@@ s . the first frame foc@@ uses on Religion .
the photo was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in the context of Christians by Muslims , or to the defense of Muslims - the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is subject to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to exam@@ ine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a de@@ eper question is however , what happens if reading these pictures can &apos;t give no longer faith .
with social media , there are thre@@ es@@ core people who have un@@ intended to re@@ alize the water around a trag@@ edy .
sug@@ ar@@ ys this mood of false and fal@@ sely information that actual fact is un@@ true and tast@@ es the real hor@@ ror of what actually happened in the DR of Congo in Nigeria , and in Myanmar ?
the spread of the spread images has already been deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
a argument is that it comes back from images of a turn@@ able to det@@ ect the trag@@ edy . the pictures even requires from the victims itself .
at the same time the conc@@ ern that certain images readers and vie@@ wers des@@ en@@ si@@ zing and sel@@ ecting the ability to receive emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study en@@ acted , such as violent media , to help others ) .
while there are some distinc@@ tive represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting , because with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they are thorough@@ ly thinking about the situation , in which a picture is somewhat sug@@ gar , which actually can be used in the context or entirely ab@@ bre@@ ed type .
a study of false supplements should be considered to be considered internationally as an internationally .

a blog with the name im@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( i.e. un@@ covered ) , language enthusi@@ astic port@@ rays a selection of words from all over the world , which is difficult or not to transl@@ ate .
such words there are in any language : you press certain situations or fe@@ el@@ ings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ translated words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are de@@ eply lic@@ ed in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ slo@@ esa ) .
but all res@@ ist hard on any attempt to a simple translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient to understand why a full explanation , and sometimes a little context is required to understand what a word is meant .
this unique words have been collected for a full time in a online list .
most of these lists at Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and L@@ ingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog one finds words out of Mw@@ ot@@ lap language from V@@ anu@@ atu , as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Get you by your parents in recognition of them how to make yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik Language , spoken in parts of Brazil , like :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The conveni@@ ence or sl@@ oth , which fe@@ els , after being cast off at cold days in the sun .
in bird words from his blog About :

sometimes , as we influence the world to analy@@ ze ourselves and classi@@ fy the l@@ ingu@@ ist on this page even more of these &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words , show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages .

like Sri Lanka with the worst fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrophe of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently the worst high water@@ - and dr@@ unk cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
trig@@ gered from the Mon@@ sun , which is usually ending in late May , are due to severe ra@@ kes the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 distri@@ cts in the south and west of the country .
after a statement of cat@@ astroph@@ es from Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people have been killed because of flo@@ ods and sl@@ amm@@ ate .
over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and roughly 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe stay .
the ra@@ ins were left slowly on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water flows in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene products in the population provide a massive challenge in the affected area and still un@@ accessible areas .
the subsequent pictures and videos have an impression of the extent of the flo@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrophe :
high tide at Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water walls up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
Sri L@@ ank@@ as dead@@ ly flo@@ ods wor@@ sen@@ ed the dam crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children , after further ra@@ ins are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was at the flood water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ag@@ oda was also over@@ flo@@ oded because of yesterday &apos;s water p@@ eg@@ s El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are made for transportation of emergency deliveries to their superior villages .
there are also various organisations and start @-@ ups to help .
Facebook pages like help Flo@@ od Vic@@ inity in Sri Lanka and 2017 disaster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about high @-@ water and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue team are needed for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all , dry food and vi@@ vid goods for high @-@ water @-@ offer@@ ings -
we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 4@@ 49@@ 729 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need to help animals in this field .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share its position data with the help of the app to share the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ ic@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , pic@@ nic me a &quot; high @-@ water help &quot; button a who allowed to call users , a vehicle to pick up by auxiliary services and don@@ ations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
similarly , they introduced a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had more than one thousand requests and 150 successful navigation actions for the epis@@ ode .
the agreed of the government and civ@@ ilian population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as , with which several social media platforms are fully explo@@ ited , they bring residents in need to safety and aff@@ ection@@ ate aid workers .
this has prev@@ ents the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the recovery of the norm@@ ality .

in January , when I joined the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco , I took part in the neighbour@@ ing and love friend on the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me her children . she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute , we still call for the rights of women .
in the next channel we concl@@ ude rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of ra@@ um@@ bre@@ ll@@ as and people , some keep the ic@@ onic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from a American flag , other gu@@ inea f@@ olen fighting against Islamic flag .
my gir@@ l@@ friend look at me and says , &quot; these things are not afraid of you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; I ask .
I have already led this conversation .
people , with whom I have been working or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their introduction .
they c@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practi@@ ced our religion differ@@ ently .
we identify us to be a Muslim but different kind . but some@@ how we put all in the same Muslim she@@ ds .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective show that as soon as Muslims , which can &apos;t fit there , must be Muslim .
compensation to be ordered
I don &apos;t ste@@ w that alone .
this is even the poet , whose po@@ etry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures come in a sense when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I am now , he was an orth@@ od@@ ox@@ er Muslim pre@@ acher and sch@@ ol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day , at which he died , the centre of his po@@ etry .
but in the western introduction , religion was deleted in Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his po@@ etry .
this lion makes a major part of the history of the 1,7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists of Muslims of Muslims , Western books have been colon@@ ised since the turn of centuries .
this promising image language is determined by the dark man who should fear , and the exotic woman who should save .
the Norwegian Palestinian sci@@ entist Edward S@@ aid gained the story behind this pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures can also be seen today .
our polit@@ icians , the news industry and Hollywood .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how this powerful , fool@@ ish Nar@@ rative is dominated our news fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ r@@ ativ over@@ sh@@ ad@@ eth the reality that led to the nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the USA will not operate their first female pre@@ sidency in the last three decades .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative sch@@ emes to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are forced to bear their head in public buildings and Saudi Arab@@ ian women , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , that these both are both sides of the same medal .
a mighty group committed &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong f@@ ool weak@@ ens mus@@ lim@@ atic women who lead movements for change .
it looks over , that the first Muslim prayer was spoken on American ground of Afri@@ kan@@ ers who had been killed with slave ships .
there are the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this f@@ ool has occupied our collective pre@@ ference @-@ art de@@ eply and def@@ ective that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children to target an@@ tim@@ ing lim@@ atic attacks and al@@ ik@@ es .
because of these stories that we tell , and because of the species we tell it , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , the religion but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion Swiss francs
in the news industry we do more than just Stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative who help us understand the world .
and my industry is talking about to record the Nar@@ r@@ ativ of the 1,7 billion .
and we are doing here , where seven million Muslims were in the highest degree &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one @-@ third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immig@@ rants of the first generation , who come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my parents were employed in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first je@@ well@@ ery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ ni@@ atz@@ ers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ zer was made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ ans from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan said the Sk@@ ylin@@ es of the world , my parents were uns@@ aved Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ fortun@@ ate Muslims and American ?
sometimes when I ask , why I don &apos;t ask pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ ful hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ us to wear all Muslims with respect - &quot; from respect to pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I am jo@@ ke , we do not wear all t@@ asch@@ ans with us .
we also must be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; to be selected almost always for additional safety g@@ ul@@ ks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim sch@@ ol@@ ers , Muslim activ@@ ists and inter@@ religious activ@@ ists who were efforts to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current band of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ist equipment with fin@@ al@@ ise , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for counter@@ part , which is already a Muslim ; or what about Islam is , man@@ i@@ pu@@ rely .
due to the stories that we tell , and due to the way , in which we tell them , the Islam@@ osity exists in more than just a stran@@ ger , who enjo@@ ys the head cloth .

I would like to declare this .
I was born in Muslims , but a Muslims was born when I was four years old when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the under@@ floor of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
if Sozial@@ sci@@ entist who describe religious life , she lay on the following terms : faith , behavior , and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are not always visible , but they are there .
maybe I would like my gir@@ l@@ friend , my neighbour@@ ing in the fire , my rock in the fire that I am Muslims when they could separate by the 15 @-@ metre concrete and air that could separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous rit@@ ual with my daughter , if I have called them in my arms , and ye die Arab verses to protect the cor@@ ro@@ gan@@ s and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every of them get 3 times .
I be@@ fore@@ see that they are protected from evil , the evil which can see and see the evil which you can see .
my Muslim faith is not always visible but my Muslim Br@@ otherhood is always part of my shadow .

Muslims should be too hard to talk that she had said to me , if I have a bad day .
Muslims will be in it , as they have brought me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a people , that - over centuries - by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; kol@@ oni@@ alism , which has founded a company with the name hon@@ ored British East Timor @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep importance to call my whole Lord .

affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palest@@ ini@@ ans who have families like with my grand@@ father , of the colonial world , who have divided the Muslim world as the game of risk .
Muslims should know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have all of up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first fli@@ er bom@@ b of history was rejected by a Muslim country in front of a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an ind@@ ish , fas@@ c@@ lic subject to the British Empire , led by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; since he led the first mos@@ que in England .

it means to know that if a trag@@ edy carries a trag@@ edy that carries a Muslim name , the story of four times more will be reported as a story with a white attacks .

structural Islam@@ osity exists in the Muslim regist@@ r@@ atures which began with President Bush and President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of Mos@@ che@@ en .
it is in the immig@@ ration that takes a five @-@ year old child in Hand sch@@ emes .
it consists of a country that linked its bound@@ aries from just outside the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list , &quot; which contains largely Arab and Muslims .

initiative for ex@@ plan@@ atory art wants to pres@@ erve urban language diversity
history of guns , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can you give it a way , here and now , in spite of a language you want to enter into connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , the founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the explanation of stories in their original language .
global Vo@@ ices reported a short initiative called Steven Bird , the Im@@ port@@ able blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the voice variety of major cities and would be worthy .
in fact , in urban regions , such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS had already been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not given to the children of children .
the project is valid for the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avo@@ ided , if we make cities that di@@ vers@@ ität , safe spaces , in which it must not forget to hear them .
while &quot; listen often , it is often associated to understand this events instead &quot; the list@@ eners to feel to feel , link . &quot;
in this format , Co@@ unters will initially set their history in their own language and transl@@ ating or explain it in English .
even if the participants have no professional history counter , their dev@@ ot@@ ion and its representation is that the audi@@ ences are to put on it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emot@@ ions out , than be the language not longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which will be told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the co@@ at@@ ings en@@ chan@@ ting in Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain the country of typical customs of cre@@ ams .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel of Has@@ en and Pav@@ ian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
after he asked the importance of his f@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara will be asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience , that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a wide Gr@@ in@@ sen he divi@@ des his feeling of in@@ kl@@ us@@ iv@@ ity :
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tively ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project , can organize T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own history .
Puerto Rico requested by the United States New Com@@ position of State School

the adv@@ oc@@ ation of the deb@@ ts have also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is your requirement :
the people Puerto Ric@@ os demands that the polit@@ icians , mess@@ enger and government agencies , which are responsible for deb@@ ts for their cor@@ ruption .
we require a financial ex@@ am and a tap committee without personal interests in public deb@@ ts , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate rem@@ un@@ eration , which can be found in the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay a debt , which is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be able to canc@@ el their pension funds .
we require immediate measures .

these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto R@@ os requires a wide re@@ struc@@ turing of the state infrastructure .
outside the outside wounded measures will be taken without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens from the people to be rejected by the people .

the book which was published in last year and has been licensed out here , contains a number of lifts , who emplo@@ y the free culture in the presence of suppression .
it is hom@@ age to bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction to the introduction :
this book would like to know how to assem@@ ble movements for free knowledge and what the true cost is associated with which this is connected .
activ@@ ists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have been working on page to create about the ne@@ b@@ ula , which gives our news@@ fe@@ eds and create a little sense of our experiences .
this book is a trial , Bas@@ le Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
we haven &apos;t have any information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of the collections of his friends and his family a voice that goes on his release , and they want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how bas@@ sel has a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us begin to think about their own fate , de@@ eds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what we have decided to have us ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time extreme consider@@ ations ?
the web developers for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the det@@ ention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was taken from the A@@ dra jail , an non @-@ military setup , transferred to an unknown village .
his wife , the writer and lawyer No@@ ura Gh@@ az@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ ed Bas@@ ed on the basis of a &quot; stric@@ tly ge@@ heim &quot; drawn the command of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
Gh@@ az@@ i reported that she had been cont@@ acted by people who had been cont@@ acted by people in the Assad government , and set them out by a alleged death part against her husband in knowledge .
his stay and state remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , played a decisive role in it to expand access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ician and at the moment of the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded bas@@ ics , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of Bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ otypes , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construc@@ t the ancient ruins of Palm@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arch@@ e@@ ological sites in the world , the trail of numerous civil society , and the Greek @-@ Roman architectural style of hi@@ bit traditions and Per@@ sian influ@@ ences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that 10 years after he began to put it with this work , the IS all this architecture that is not just the cultural heritage of Sys@@ ri@@ ens but of the world are em@@ bro@@ iled .
this str@@ apping to the digital archae@@ ology and the preserv@@ ation has created a time cartridge that will be established for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
the case was not able to close this project , not yet able to close this project .
No@@ ura Gh@@ az@@ i has also contributed to the book , and writes about the passion of their man , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my total life to dream of freedom and bas@@ sel taught me to embr@@ ace her .
I was over@@ whel@@ med if I know his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even as he was found in jail .
I learned to read English well , to write and to speak .
he always has his knowledge to everyone who has asked . he has taught other in@@ lets to read English and to speak .
bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smart@@ phones .
he brought me the internet .
he also brought other in@@ sist@@ ed how to use computers , at least theore@@ ti@@ cally , without having held their hands in their hands .
Gh@@ az@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote in prison in 2012 to 2015 , when he was found in prison .
bas@@ sel and No@@ ura have been working together for a year together in the book .

the stories of many other people remain unknown .

Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to cor@@ ruption , director of dis@@ miss@@ al compl@@ aints to previous post
Mos@@ am@@ bik@@ ans re@@ acted to a cor@@ ruption in case of a governmental member after half of his prison sentence to the workplace in the state appar@@ atus , was committed to the cor@@ ruption .
this is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other accused were sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other accused .
the money came from public Gel@@ dern from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council stood at the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 due to good guidance and required his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 , then .
in accordance with a statement of the Prosecutor of the Republic , the request of the Republic , there is no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , due to its old post@@ age , since the company had no discipl@@ inary method after his det@@ ention .
however , many inhabitants does not know the promotion .
the centre for public integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , shortly CIP ) , a local instance , committed to public transpar@@ ency , sentenced to a interview with Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to set up the director :
represents a withdraw@@ al in the fight against cor@@ ruption and illustr@@ ates the absence of transpar@@ ency and is even a step towards the efforts of our strategy , such a CIP .
what we can take to knowledge that the company would have a discipl@@ inary procedure against the contra@@ dic@@ ation .
however , the company was apparent , however , pro@@ ves no reasonable steps for the use of the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio Vaz , a significant voice in the mos@@ am@@ bul@@ ance of social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well as &quot; resist@@ ible &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza a compet@@ ent guy would be , he was sentenced to imprisonment after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating re@@ tain , he could adv@@ ise and his image .
but because he is ink@@ om@@ pet@@ ent , he has entered into the company to be re@@ integrated in the company which he helped har@@ m .
consequently , it is apparent : Cam@@ b@@ aza is to be paid for his silence .
contra@@ dic@@ ally !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ am@@ bik@@ ers and student of politics in Brazil , the director told no mur@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was re@@ warded by the state , because he could ins@@ ei@@ ve him that one would be re@@ warded with such a way that someone has already re@@ warded me .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the Mor@@ al to return and to serve the state , * he had already used a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only himself served on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as handy to become an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is ti@@ red , the pre@@ loaded , and finally was sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was re@@ warded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefer to mind the prime minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves include the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Mos@@ am@@ bik@@ ers will not only stay for ever as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , cut @-@ in and - by said - Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous imag@@ inations were , when he was energ@@ etic , that &quot; an ambitious man should be able to sell also the pat@@ ernity in its am@@ bul@@ ance , his own individual interest , for sale . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but it does not change of his counter@@ parts .
a ambitious man is de@@ cri@@ min@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were re@@ jects :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he sat 10 years old and came out free .
and today it sets him the company , with which he was dis@@ obe@@ dient , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Directory of α@@ λ@@ ι@@ к ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017

Facebook block@@ ed the rapid word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to in@@ justice
the bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ er@@ b@@ se or sp@@ age .

according to the Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their postal network out of the network because it was the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or general as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian &quot; .
Facebook presents the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or ar@@ ron@@ ized ( in bur@@ mes@@ ial Scri@@ pture ) as part of an initiative to set the widespread problem of the Hass@@ le in Bur@@ ma in the social network .
in recent years , the asc@@ en@@ sion has given radi@@ cal nation@@ alist movements to the Word .
in particular , it is a word that mostly of Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a min@@ ority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hat@@ red in Myanmar , the company dedicated a lot of sen@@ sel@@ ely content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; just like to be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word is calling out to call hat@@ ches automatically .
the context is important and # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that Post@@ s , in which they have discussed the use of the word , or dou@@ b@@ ts to the use of the word , have been cen@@ sored .
in addition , there are several bur@@ m@@ ese words with a fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same accounting sequence such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is also written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ alter ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ k@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
Fac@@ e@@ book@@ n@@ utzer A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ ate declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends on spiritual kind , whether they could destroy them as he could play his back pain .
the set ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the frag@@ ran@@ ort ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - similar to the rac@@ ial expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ un is the opinion that she is Hass@@ le radi@@ cal nation@@ alists , however , st@@ ressed that Facebook analy@@ tical his m@@ ute , before all the Post@@ s ext@@ ingu@@ ishing , which occurs in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it felt the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you can write on Fac@@ e@@ ook .
what instead of instead , the mail should be carefully analy@@ ze and check him by chec@@ king the following words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ alter ) .
the good is that this dre@@ ad@@ ly nation@@ alists , the hate speech will receive a pretty good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circum@@ cise her nation@@ alism .
while the action can send a strong signal to all sending , the hate language may not keep the efficiency of this strategy .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat should have proven that the Zen@@ or@@ ship often is often an cat and mouse game , with the user social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative writing of the scen@@ ic word to press their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ ate described as Facebook began to delete his position when he wanted to share his friends when he al@@ lied to his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is :
... when I was atten@@ tively atten@@ tively to this new Directive of Facebook , I made a post to make my Facebook friends , that the word is closed .
Iron@@ master , my post from Facebook is removed and me , the li@@ ken , post@@ ing and parts of in@@ timate for 24 hours , because the post &quot; will not say the post &quot; Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posters from people who have no negative out@@ look , or the simply trying to show their opinions towards the hat@@ red radi@@ cal nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that its post was removed , nothing to do with hate language :
post without Hass@@ ler &apos;s speech .
in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious foundations are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook has supposed to do more than the start of the initiative , for example the bur@@ m@@ ese internet community ask :
Facebook likes a we@@ alth@@ y inten@@ tion to reduce rac@@ ism in Bur@@ ma through their platform , but it does not work .
these words will only take more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it seems , as if they start this without local context or technical support , they have b@@ anned words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Er@@ bs@@ enc@@ ur@@ ry . &quot;
even as they found it , they didn &apos;t have made mistake , they tried to prove the random post@@ age .
if you have a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that have a large turnover , would be great .
Fac@@ e@@ books automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has donated for a lot of don@@ ors under the users .
instead of it serious , users can now take over Facebook fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ le to see if their posters will be taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post , which have no hate language , but still remov@@ es :
with homologation used .
the bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to eat and look at a chair and look at a Indian movie .
just to try out , whether Facebook contains the post , which contains the Word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , with homologation .
next post &quot; When you are a doctor , do you he@@ al people ? &quot;
screenshot , with homologation .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious foundations , social networks are used to expand their voices and their influence .
among others , Hass@@ le is to con@@ vin@@ ce the violence into the municip@@ alities in Myanmar in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine Area , especially in the territory of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes are forced to escape thousands of Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
Facebook has been working for his failure to bring out ar@@ cer@@ ations to his bur@@ m@@ ese sides under control , critical .
but rather than just hit the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better ongoing in context than on code concentrated initi@@ atives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 038 ; Tobago is finished with the children &apos;s playground
a wedding ring in sand .

the children &apos;s before is illegal and Tobago is now illegal .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted a law on 9 June 2017 , which is supposed to provide this practice , so that the married age is now at 18 .
prior to this amend@@ ment of the husband held several members in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group that was gathered in representative of the various religious groups that the state is not one of the country since that , at the age not the rich regulations . &quot;
this happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ tual partner of the UN child prevention , the min@@ ors of the age of 18 , defined every man under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15 were already married , in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the national central office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which grew up , laws about the children , followed at the feet and fre@@ ed large support . dou@@ bt@@ edly , they followed this result .
nevertheless , it was not smo@@ oth@@ ly smo@@ oth@@ ly .
a Hind@@ u leader , e.g. had no concerns to say the crit@@ ics of children &apos;s children to say they should be dam@@ ned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind religious opposition asked for vol@@ t@@ ages in this actually un@@ comp@@ lic@@ ated cause , and somet@@ ime in doubt if the opposition would agree to the bill in the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against children &apos;s before decided to be decided in spite of 4 Sen@@ ators ( among them one wife ) of the opposition and an independent , which he could be discussed under the Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where he would already make a simple majority to the law .
now only the President of the country &apos;s vote and the law pro@@ claim the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators found on Facebook a status update , Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against children before she was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 voices , and nobody decided on it .
when he had decided before the Senate , the study now be decided to be the law .
the majority of the social media user was exc@@ ited because the laws have been finally modified .
Facebook member of Lov@@ ell Francis , who cloth@@ ed a prime minister in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and un@@ necessary sm@@ ede , which does not wear the core of the matter , but know what ? the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that is almost every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely enough to dis@@ order the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day finally came :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excel News !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for sure ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who list@@ ened to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society , which said quite open@@ ly about it , how important the adoption of the law said :
the married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independ@@ ently of the religious status of 18 years .
the draft on behalf of the husband has been decided on June 9th , 2017 .
in the Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 members and there were 35 members present at the vote .
all members of members who were opposed to the law .
the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tobago is no longer allowed .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # tri@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ ild@@ use .
many thanks to all the activ@@ ists who have f@@ aint him .
congratulations .
a Dan@@ ke to our members .
however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma M@@ aha Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organisation of the country .
before months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj Mah@@ ar@@ aj announced his inten@@ tion , ju@@ di@@ cial steps should be adopted , and he seems to be the promise .
while the Att@@ orney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a Ver@@ fe@@ eder of the Law , said it is right through law@@ ful if Mah@@ ar@@ aj would like to pres@@ erve the law , most social media users , one would need the debate on the subject .
Patricia Br@@ rell sm@@ ote :
Dear Sat , when we would like to keep the debate in general , in a way that only pan@@ ic and un@@ m@@ wood could cause it , that it may be used by large , hard fleet , that they may be used in the advantage , if you would be ready to pass the discussion ?
or do you believe that it is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a ju@@ di@@ cial ancest@@ or against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there is still places on the world where the children &apos;s before in different grad@@ ations legal or continue to rule the norm , though it returns to them .

on Sunday early , the Office of the local news service Yar@@ News announced that they were chopped .
by the site of websites , Turkish users can watch the Wikipedia content again .

for over one month , Turkey enters the popular and on the crowd sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for Tag is clear how important the platform for users is to find useful and reliable information .
both students as well as rep@@ orter and fans of TV series are against the pl@@ ywood .
although many techn@@ icians are lived for block@@ ed websites ( a current article by the New York Times stated that Turkey has the third largest V@@ PN prev@@ alen@@ ce in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users are not in this category .
although Turkey has been closed since 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , has been held regular block@@ ers of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
after China , Turkey is the world &apos;s most famous country in the world when it goes around the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship Wikipedia by Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages are now updated ( pages that are on the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer computers ) , which is not difficult on the system of domain name , thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is available in spite of the legal pro@@ hibition .
in a b@@ log@@ mail reported to IP@@ FS about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( on the number of Wikipedia ) , we put everything that on sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so , the opportunity to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and shared manner .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ k@@ ipe@@ di@@ a.org itself .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step is performed independ@@ ently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it was just around screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to walk sper@@ m .

a Nep@@ al@@ es@@ ian wild@@ life photographer uses his camera to do the need for the natural protection .

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he had seen around him , never satisfied . they disappeared with bad mot@@ ives and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated him itself to bear and try to bear the situation .
he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar opened Sag@@ ar to bring up to the international stage .
and his home place directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that shoot the attention to Nep@@ als wild@@ life .
he described the Facebook as this first @-@ class location in his work helps :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it better give to a pas@@ sion@@ ate game photography ! !
I rested in at home when suddenly Nav@@ ar@@ aj ( the Manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) had called a call of my father , that at the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a Leopard would be a Leopard .
the river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist location Sau@@ r@@ aha .
I go immediately with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had seen him and showed me the place on the other side , where the Leopard was found , and I immediately began to tri@@ p@@ sen pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar disp@@ ute a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and would like to destroy understanding that wild animals are not so fine , as they look like .
and he should know it , because he stood ti@@ ger@@ m from the presence of face to face :
a tiger could not be aston@@ ished by the mind of sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
even I was at home for the darkness at home , when suddenly the king of the Bus@@ ch@@ works appeared in the way . he puts down immediately , and he fired me through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
his passion for funding from Nep@@ als nature and wild@@ life is not always easy .
it was waiting for 22 days , and lived in a tent to make in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took to capture a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live in the tourist area .
see below some of these photos below .

years after the wedding car there was Indian women for the first time , the names of their hus@@ bands

this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , a award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was again published as part of an Content @-@ Sh@@ aring Convention .
in many parts of India , women do not avoid the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands , or even of older men in the family .
instead , they use a Pr@@ on@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ osen sp@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh , give women to respect the husband to respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should ab@@ use the norm .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted out of the Indian state O@@ dis@@ ha by a family @-@ court in O@@ dis@@ ha by her family and the village community , after she had an married transformation with name .
the tradition also did not call their wives also at the name , also under men it is also common . however , it is far from less assign@@ ments if not at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health@@ care and house fr@@ auen , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main constitu@@ ent of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they discuss the enemy of pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss it .
as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is run by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and is used for the installation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of intern@@ s , such as child hei@@ rate to the network of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and runs these clubs .
they reported how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and made them simultaneously to em@@ bass@@ ad@@ ors at the same time .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in its discussions round showed , hand@@ led by women who did not call their hus@@ bands in the name .
she was chosen for this topic , because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
the names of their hus@@ bands did not speak according to the name of their hus@@ bands , a Br@@ auch , which they keep all sun@@ light , and never have put them in question .
Roh@@ ini m@@ ills :
this tradition has test@@ ified that a woman respec@@ ts her husband and wishes to give him a long life .
one woman who doesn &apos;t hold this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ y , as woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deep that we have never made us up to this discussion round thoughts .
in the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never been called her husband until now had never been called by name , as it runs at home .
she showed the discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband is still long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , I must call him from now on his name .
with this confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
following the video projection , the women tried to bring the debate with a exercise in speed .
Roh@@ ini asked any participant in the name of her husband with different feeling - happy , off@@ ended , sad , lov@@ ingly , and so on .
then she asked them , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it be equal to this ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women shall never speak the names of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so not@@ ori@@ ous that it was just before the whole exercise in front of the whole exercise ; another decided to dis@@ pose the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family , having c@@ ursed it .
the expression of their faces was ek@@ static .
I think it will never forget it again .
even in A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ r@@ ausch about , with an ancient Br@@ auch , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands in the name .
and they held their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a wife called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas used to the women in his head : his wife could not stop his name .
another cler@@ ical member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was afraid , she was afraid , saying that it was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less ob@@ vious and the situation in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women tries to stop other practices , as for example , as the tear of the cin@@ ogen@@ ous red point on the fore@@ head which shows the husband :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the cin@@ ematic red point when it was also open .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard it to bear him .
the other women are not complete with that , but my , they be now in a better position to pick him up on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a saf@@ er place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip to every discussion club .
usually , we packed lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make women make sure what could hear , &quot; says it . &quot;
in the last months , they celebrated their own bir@@ th@@ days in their own birth days with cake ; they d@@ anced and talking about things that they had never thought earlier than they had never thought .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working here for so many years since so many years I have been working on some things , for example , like our identity of our hus@@ bands , still never hon@@ est@@ ly .
it fe@@ els great , certain things according to say , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have connected us on the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have been carried out in the group since their marriage .
for most , the right is okay , but some wanted to bear a sal@@ es@@ ta cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ants , they have not forgotten .
after many stri@@ fe and discussion about the ex@@ cer@@ pts of your own clothes , the Mor@@ al is associated with Sar@@ is and much more , Car@@ ug@@ ged Roh@@ ini its own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
as next , they decided now to plan a trip to Go@@ a , when they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they can create it .
on the question of whether in the five months have already changed something changed since the first discussion club has been modified , Roh@@ ini announced that the things have slowly come into ro@@ les :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women proven a few times , but then they returned to say the name of her husband .
some , included me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are present .
just one or two say the names of their hus@@ bands , one or two women are now able to bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they would like to reach their lives - like the Fe@@ il@@ ies of more freedom of movement or their own clothing - at the end of a difficult navig@@ ating river .
by adding mut@@ ually self @-@ trust , they will be aware of them that they will sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a vic@@ tim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there too .
but this club there is everyone of us that will change anything .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman is home in the club and other people reported that we speak and what we do .
we sit all in the same boat .

at the beginning of the month three men were killed in Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and found a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and imprisoned in the epis@@ ode , that the bodies of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
it fe@@ ars the local super@@ st@@ itions that the head of a gl@@ itter@@ ing man &apos;s gold was an old or ri@@ ches , explained the career pre@@ cher from Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on gl@@ itter@@ ing men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the aim of killing purposes for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this resulted in that the UN 2016 is a mission to investig@@ ate this practice in the South African country to investig@@ ate this practice .
the per@@ secution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is usual in other countries of South Africa , especially in the neighbour@@ ing area , especially in the neighbour@@ ing country of Tanzania , where the government developed camp@@ a@@ ign@@ s to combat these super@@ st@@ itions and advantages .

PR@@ M believes that Sh@@ aman are involved in the death of gl@@ itter@@ ing men .
the per@@ secution and assass@@ ination of gl@@ itter@@ ing individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , has given cultural mot@@ ives and is believed to do the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que in Bet@@ sy ( PR@@ M ) , which would have existed , according to the victims in the head of power , the ri@@ chn@@ ess generated .

a photo of Li@@ u X@@ ia@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably recently done .
this story was originally published on Hong Kong Free Press on July 8 , 2017 .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u X@@ ia@@ ob@@ o has given attention to international community attention when his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he has been delivered for liver cancer at the end stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State risk ) , after having responded to the draft of the Charter 08 , a manif@@ esto that sought the democratic reform in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Foreign Ministry in China has referred to us as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and is a speaker , it didn &apos;t count it than &quot; it is not necessary to discuss this cause with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China receives China calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winners and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , fre@@ ed or give him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ized the strict treatment of the combination in Beijing , other things are fully pr@@ ono@@ unced .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ized several reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Comm@@ ission@@ er of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ person on it , to comment whether the United Nations should be ex@@ ert to enable Li@@ u to allow treatment abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway fell into the stores after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was finally nothing to do with the decision .
diplom@@ atic relations were res@@ umed during December last year . only in June , Norway signed a agreement to take the salmon into China , since the exports had been block@@ ed since 2010 .
after the message has been widespread that Li@@ u was serious , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ cond@@ itional release of expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to get his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to record his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to adop@@ t Li@@ u and his wife , immediately by the house arrest of arrest and allow to allow medical support to seek attention where he wants .
the Sp@@ endi@@ ces of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ g@@ her@@ ini , called China , also ordered to release Li@@ us , as they said in a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect all the limit@@ ations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they are to meet all visits and receive you , who wish it , and communic@@ ate to communic@@ ate with the outside world .
USA
U.S. Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad divided by the Americans , that he has g@@ otten the possibility for treatment abroad , ins@@ of@@ ing it to him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the U.S. em@@ bass@@ y in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the message agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message sent to the Chinese authorities not only allowed to release Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the US Embassy attracted a true answer from China to itself , with the conclusion of the Foreign Ministry , that &quot; no country have the right to make a unique and un@@ belie@@ ving remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple that China should offer :
protection and freedom such as pas@@ sport and access to medical care of its election , which they are entitled to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international oblig@@ ations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kle@@ y and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government on the way , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally fre@@ ed .
I challeng@@ ed China to fre@@ ed the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ X@@ ia@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , that he may apply in a regular medical treatment k@@ ann@@ . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
the German governments of Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u will get all the medical support that he needs &quot; and that one &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u X@@ ia@@ ob@@ o was the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplom@@ atic sources in Beijing on the news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns about the ver@@ bel around Li@@ u could find the visit to Hamburg .
Canada KO@@ O@@ ZA
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China asked to provide a reasonable medical care and provide the opportunity to give thanks to his family .
Li@@ us An@@ w@@ alt told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ us Mrs. , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always permitted the room in the hospital , and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside , including his law@@ yers to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um told :
Canada calls China on China , its international human rights oblig@@ ations , including freedom of freedom to ass@@ ess the freedom of freedom and dis@@ closed the rights of these rights .
France
France Ministry of Foreign Affairs called China in a declaration on June 29 , to contact Li@@ u from humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be sei@@ zed to ensure that Li@@ u X@@ ia@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments that he , regardless where , is required of his wife and his family contact to him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would have called Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave no further information , whether France will finally record him .
Taiwan
the Council of the land@@ line in Taiwan required China on June 27 at Li@@ u , and a larger tolerance opposite to those who require a peaceful medium to demand political re@@ forms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the reign@@ ing Democratic Fort@@ ress Party called China to allow the sick of intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als Li@@ u to treat in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u , and gave to that many kind@@ ly have asked him to pray for Li@@ us .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that he took initi@@ atives and had been committed to a harmon@@ ious , stabil@@ ised and we@@ alth@@ y in China , which had contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally moved and encour@@ aged me personally , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u X@@ ia@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and legal government in China .
Singapore : City or Country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Domaine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may be st@@ up@@ m , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be viewed as a city as a city .
this re@@ mark has trig@@ gered a debate in the b@@ log@@ osph@@ ere .
during the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State Association of the State of New York , the Minister that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ stands that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has put in question whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , whereby most people go to a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to def@@ end the logic of logic , to def@@ end the existing author@@ it@@ arian statement of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and orders to create this valuable land , you will say that we will finally be no country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the certificate of a flight before the respon@@ si@@ bilities , a mandatory bid .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to what man could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what he was un@@ identified und@@ isp@@ uted .
in contrast , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore can be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , same cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally .
as soon as you reach the core point of the Th@@ ames , again the good old ly@@ re from the aut@@ onomous Mach@@ b@@ ern is to leave the promises , abandoned logic , because they fit better to their power .
in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests concerning our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really not answers .
relevant questions , he complet@@ es Non @-@ Rep@@ r@@ ational Art .
Rachel Z@@ eng Requ@@ ires Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustr@@ ate his opinion , as they did not agree with this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult .
if Singapore is no country , but a city , so to what land is part of the city ...
shortly , I understand nothing .
I would be very th@@ ank@@ ful if our commercial K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would assume the point to clar@@ ify this point where he became very paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by calling on his comment posted on the blog , he shows that you should begin to read the entire cooperation of the conference , that you could understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
Read the address .
when he said , Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; to be a country , &quot; declared that the elections in Singapore is so un@@ inten@@ tionally important , even if we are free and just@@ ified elections .
he en@@ ched Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party win a party ? ) .
when he said , Singapore &quot; was no country , &quot; he did not make it manif@@ est in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who is as leader of a Her@@ an@@ growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I &apos;m talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which is expected to be understood with them , or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of political leader of Singapore , I have dou@@ b@@ ts and I &apos;m not once sure whether he really is associated , really associated and deli@@ ber@@ ately what he is def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ asek Review divided the sponge points of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; committed an error , &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher Ver@@ ger ?
if Singapore is no country , we are only considered independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country go the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equal to the country and town .
since he plays an important role in the government cabins , the statements by the Lord Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am of serious significance .
why do the discovery of Singapore to def@@ end her military service , def@@ end her country ?
who must pay our prime minister ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
where the Journal of a Dec@@ ade &apos;s Journal about the years of service , Singapore is , and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this pro@@ position seems to have many people more expensive ...
no one has ever spoken that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
I can understand that we often say such as &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; etc . &quot; but this is not quite right .
we should speak to the defense of the city .

the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , Japan and Japan .
the question that is put in Japan on most , is : &quot; you are Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , do I speak to me , and answer me . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .

then , on my clar@@ ification , the default set : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many can@@ oes do perhaps be kept in@@ hum@@ ility when they are held for Americans , but inter@@ fer@@ ed me .
for anyone who does not know , there are little that diff@@ ers from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadian flag is well visible at their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadian .
by contrast , however ... .
so , when I started 20 years ago , the world began to travel , before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian Maple have always made small ancest@@ or sheets at their bag@@ gage to distingu@@ ish themselves from their American neigh@@ bo@@ urs .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons in us !
equally sex@@ ually mature E@@ w have been leg@@ ally legal since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we say obviously very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups compared to ethnic groups .
we are not such as these types south of the border .
we are kind of Canadian .
I hate the .
first , I have many American friends who I ad@@ mi@@ red very ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would be nothing to make me when using Johnny from Dallas would be conf@@ used .
Marc out of Austin .

or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; is called to be called , is in fact , as the fe@@ ar@@ ful , gentle , but trag@@ eous figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the actual problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no person@@ ality has .
there is no corners and edges , nothing that can be cast out .
harm@@ less , is un@@ ob@@ vious and des@@ ir@@ able to earn any attention .
this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , from the d@@ ingen that happen around one around .
I would even go , to say that the desire is free , and alone to be one main part of the Canadian .
we t@@ end to care of our own mat@@ ters .
what to sign as &quot; nice , &quot; it is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadian tal@@ ents are not often talk about the fence with neigh@@ bo@@ urs .
we lack a warm warm , open fri@@ endl@@ iness , which I now connect with my American friends .

one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video which the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which took power in 2014 , and despite their promises to restore civ@@ ilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( Ph@@ a@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him that provisions made his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not explic@@ it@@ ly polit@@ ically , music video refers to the military service of the Jun@@ ta .

last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was block@@ ed in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ists the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpre@@ ted as a creative and enter@@ tain@@ ing introduction to the Thai policy , in@@ particular , as it holds the location of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
look at once this photos of the video , which refer to some of the political issues , which have been committed in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; refer to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the provis@@ ional Constitution , which is the commander of the army which is the commander of the army which makes an important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your setting &quot; refers to the not@@ ori@@ ous programme for &quot; integration of journalists , students , scientists , activ@@ ists , political core and other people who are considered the Jun@@ ta as a cr@@ itic .
the picture above refle@@ cts the implementation of the law on computer science against , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities , to arrested activ@@ ists and other crit@@ ics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , monit@@ ored online content and persons which pre@@ ached the mon@@ archy to per@@ sec@@ uted the mon@@ archy .

on 20 May 2014 , he was proclaimed the war law in Thailand .
two days later , there was a coup of the Army .
one of the problems which per@@ sec@@ uted the Jun@@ ta , is their decision to buy U @-@ boats , although security sex@@ es war@@ ned them that the purchase is un@@ necessary and con@@ sent from taxes .
in the video will even be shown as people are thrown into a black delivery van , before they bring them into an interval bearings , another problem .

the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years has passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ abstr@@ act war officially ended , but his f@@ ool are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show market pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Kohl@@ hammer of Ab@@ road Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Gre@@ eks , Firing @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ er and Armen@@ ians lived and worked for Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Rus@@ sians and ab@@ h@@ ases are living in the area .
such sett@@ l@@ ements are also known in Ab@@ ch@@ elles .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people still lived there , are only a few hundred people in these spirits .
this is known for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people , after having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , approximately 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it falls to him difficult to end this .
&quot; that is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I speak to you ? &quot; &quot; why ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gardens , who have all community community .
now there is only paved road with al@@ tered Pra@@ yer @-@ buildings .
people who once lived on this place and their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union donated the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live around fifty inhabitants .
around 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages looks like .
the Chr@@ yst@@ one k@@ ow@@ kas that are still one or two families - recogni@@ zes at the Balk@@ ans where wash wh@@ ence is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look at the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover the camera in the hand , they with@@ draw back immediately .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to make us photo , &quot; says one of the girl . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is forbidden to b@@ anned everything . &quot;
the girl tru@@ sted her friend something to and suddenly leave the destroyed building and dis@@ appear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mountain building named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultiv@@ ation of agricultural products for own requirements ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable .
it is difficult about the turns .
the District administration supplies in winter for free candles and bread to the villages .

despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina lives not to leave East Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever &quot; in Asia . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to take out a financial aid from her daughter , and is hard to support her young grand@@ child instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly ren@@ ches are just nine dollars .

in Mexico houses &quot; Mama Africa &quot; mig@@ rants on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI@@ .org , published here with kind permission .
on the way of mig@@ rants , cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited this place in the Mexican town Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink frame and gold colored ear@@ rings in t@@ eddy Bear .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was raised in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this pointed name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans , which are on the journey .
the hotel has rather no charm .
for approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with gro@@ unded , floors and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of afri@@ can and ha@@ iti@@ an mig@@ rants here .
sometimes , tell Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come into full @-@ bus@@ hes and from the upper part of the coast . &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
currently there is more quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already sle@@ pt on boxes .
you want to re@@ ject it .
they also helps them to hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys them drugs , they will not pay for them to pay them with a bal@@ m who exhau@@ sted the long journey from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ iao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama is a reasonable first name for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ iao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a j@@ og@@ hur@@ u ) po@@ inting with Conc@@ ep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and h@@ opes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Brack@@ et .
&quot; Yes , yes , &quot; answers he with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it is too her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ iao travels with his sister , hop@@ ing for Boston to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , however , it is for several Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then go towards north .
the family had belonged to the family of Mama . &quot; m@@ om Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; Felix Mich@@ elet , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ kaner often travel along the track together and that the Afri@@ cans already speak in Wh@@ ats@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his way , Mich@@ elet lived in Brazil and worked as a buil@@ ders on construction of the Olympic Games and the Football World Championship .
when Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been guest &apos;s guest at Mama Africa : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bu@@ ck@@ et to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he will have in the future with Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; m@@ om Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; answers he sm@@ iled . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests have often send text messages when she continued to gr@@ ind them or report about the course of their journey .
it explains that your Christian faith is the drive of their work .
don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought them to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ kling hope for mig@@ rants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
the other end of the city leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela in the other end of the city .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family lived in her small house .
he is polic@@ eman and found that the stick@@ ers have been sold to numerous African mig@@ rants .
he started to help them to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for one dollar a night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on ce@@ il@@ ings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the wilderness , and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work in the United States .
the majority of mig@@ rants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to have money from him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked to a accommodation , and a well @-@ known , a well @-@ known , her roof is offered to him .
some months later , the family lives still and tries to decide where the next steps should go .
Back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the course we ulti@@ mat@@ ely cons@@ ult their phones .
a mini@@ bus today arrived and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is nost@@ alg@@ ic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she did his album with many photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ y , who made her a cli@@ ent@@ ity , some photos of their grand@@ children and many trav@@ ellers , boy and old .
they laugh@@ ing sad , while they were shortly before .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ one , &quot; repeat them every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install on their mobile phones via mobile app .
a check @-@ point for personal communication units in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , inter@@ v@@ ated by Twitter
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic min@@ orities region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware for their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phone users received a mobile phone not@@ ation in Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi , to install a surveillance @-@ app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
in the notification , it is said that the app &quot; access to terrorist information is to access to terrorist information . &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ n@@ es the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kazak@@ h women were arrested in the aut@@ onomous ili Kazak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because it was shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private white chat group .
in the release of the police that the app sources and the distribution paths of terrorist actions , and pursu@@ es , together with &quot; Il@@ legal religious &quot; activities and &quot; ad@@ verse information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fr@@ aud , Tro@@ jan@@ ern and ph@@ ishing pages to make users to make sure that , how much time they spend your own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these features can be used in diverse way .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker is able to ste@@ amed the home network of one person .
this introduction stands in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
during the messages of digital Zen@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focused on the experience of users in the East and south , the reality is very often d@@ ying for those who live in dist@@ ant ethnic min@@ ority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to rest un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often have extreme ten@@ sions and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet cuts .
based on Twitter Bas@@ que Media Out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( invented by a Check@@ point , published pictures from a Check@@ point , at the polic@@ emen who installed the residents of either pas@@ sport , if they had already installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian is sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days .
if you have been discovered in Check@@ point using a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a return for the techn@@ ological development .
they are forced to use the people who are intended for older people , to use .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity in cap@@ turing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( resol@@ ving a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can also raise the password requirements of a Windows operating system , and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard disk .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the City Council , to minim@@ ize the spread of Il@@ legal In@@ to .
all government agencies , authorities , and associated with party facilities including universities and research institutions are ob@@ li@@ ged to follow the instructions of the Cy@@ ber@@ security Office at the operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report of Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , mentioned also this new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi released a regulation with the order to all the residents and entrepren@@ eur , until August 1st their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ e@@ books and media cards &quot; at local police register .
the inten@@ tion is apparent some@@ how to identify and destroy the person@@ ality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives you pen@@ al@@ ties for a whole range of other possible quot@@ ations , including such that foc@@ uses on peaceful religious or political messages .

they have arrested me and my father three times , but that &apos;s not yet to make me &quot; my Less@@ on &quot; as the chief of security services it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he presented his power over us by giving the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn during a peaceful protest in the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to support the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ es .
all the fo@@ requ@@ ar@@ ters are des@@ ir@@ able , only my own not .
for the first time there was still , reg@@ los , at the wrong time , even if I have no high demands on a city , which entered into the ar@@ ter@@ ies with government security and their compli@@ ces .
in the third night , the things had slightly so@@ othing after the power supply had ceased to work in the quarter .
I broke out the silence by playing several times &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house @-@ roof .
I heard my voice through the silence .
few minutes later , some of my friends felt enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends decided to join me ; we conf@@ isc@@ ated us to a pra@@ ising image that was filled with expectations and filled whole .
in such a moment there will be aware of you that you delivered the Spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in rum@@ our .
I received a call of my father : &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the Military Security Building . &quot;
he made up .
then I learned following : no matter how much honey you can teach you - nothing can return your voice , after you have the whole way to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk , &quot; let me hear me how you are &apos; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; or you &apos;re only going to cry out , if we are not near . &quot;
his bo@@ ilers eyes turned on me .
&quot; and you sad , just what to see me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did , did nothing do with cour@@ age .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , E@@ it@@ el@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was my cause so safe when I said , &quot; I would have thought that you have been forgotten my voice ever since yesterday . &quot;
and I think I &apos;ve never heard your eyes in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have fat@@ ally fat@@ ally consequences for me , and yet I have no word from what I said .
&quot; plug@@ ged him in sing@@ les and his father equal with . &quot;
&quot; his father equal to this . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this conf@@ id@@ ing pro@@ position is to me in the nose .
he was subject to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ av@@ ian torture that I was exposed monthly .
I go through the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I drink with me .
afterwards again , through the farm and the second office , which leads through one speed to the single cells .
I know all details exactly one before I enter the room .
otherwise , they &apos;ve got a bigger cell al@@ located to me .
I have to divide them with only one additional prisoners , and may immediately reset me without their permission .
after some minutes , like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I was back on a fol@@ lower communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I drove that my cell was a &quot; Initi@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long periods he ulti@@ mat@@ ely answered me .
appar@@ ently there was no one of the surrounding cells , which was similar to me , which is similar to me and called the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no mark@@ ings can be seen in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers linked its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be heard immediately .
the investig@@ ator had in@@ sured me , they would be fre@@ ew@@ able if I stay .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have had a bird &apos;s bir@@ ch to distri@@ bute all these forces , who lab@@ elled in the fruits of my head in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; out of the far .
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the terror , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black color of the destruction is , until I saw the yellow light that told us the gray in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; played on 13 . Sh@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
that was a mystery to protect the state safety in order to protect us and prevent the terror@@ ists and the terror@@ ists in us , they played their conflic@@ ts of de@@ press@@ ants in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ian dial@@ ect - so they played their conflic@@ ting range of their world view .
this is not a house which is here is no country ; it is a curse to call them co@@ existence in order to trans@@ form the cri@@ min@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a her@@ oes .
I enter the audi@@ ences and meet to Abu I@@ mad , a sli@@ m and st@@ em@@ ous man ; at least he comes to me .
he p@@ ushing a &quot; pleasant &quot; con@@ vers@@ ational , despite the visions : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join so much cru@@ cial with your life when you are to protest@@ ing these di@@ aries to protest@@ ing something soon . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know .
I have re@@ conc@@ iled to answer you , not answer .
I really can really say no longer , when loading and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation for me are become a common communication agent .
when and what happened , was in@@ important .
some voice contained in me said that I had to be re@@ conc@@ iled , though I had done nothing to earn this sentence .
on pun@@ ishment in all of their diversity .
his command is to pl@@ uck me as much meat , as possible by the body .
he calls the loving &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your dog take to your cry .
give it a pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him and you can &apos;t keep your terr@@ ie .
I didn &apos;t know my terror to him , so why they sw@@ allow the pipe through a cable .
in my first ceremony , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had been working as a gar@@ bage burning times , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had four cables in each other , to present us , from their vis@@ ibility , great in@@ vention of an enormous cables .
within a single hour , three of them went off , while I still was still in the series .
I had lost all my body in my body - and my voice , why I heard up .
the H@@ enk@@ er saw the cooling and found no pleasure in all , why he was as a neigh@@ bour to an electri@@ cally charged staff .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter .
my semi@@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect current leader .
the de@@ d@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was again .
after two terri@@ ble hours , he decided that he met his oblig@@ ation for this night .
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep me again ; let &apos;s say it was my only option .
some hours of verg@@ ent that came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning bet .
the door opens up and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ass@@ f@@ ick@@ er . &quot;
I answer with the voice of a exhau@@ sted youth : &quot; my lord , my father must make terri@@ ble wor@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; be silent , and get away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LG@@ BT + -@@ community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib is a c@@ ig@@ ars in his studio .
the picture was taken by A@@ man Ma@@ dan , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib brings more to the most of its time ; times he turns into his screen , once to his computer , and again to his couch .
what can you leave , it is a cigarette between his fing@@ ers or his with nic@@ ot@@ y lips .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house since 1967 ; in which Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family looked to be forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Farmer ) .
since more than six years , H@@ da@@ ib has been a pas@@ sion@@ ate activ@@ ist , who under@@ went to the conservative majority of GI@@ LE@@ CH@@ TER@@ RO@@ LL@@ ING , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression and rap@@ es@@ ity .
with his music , which often replaced with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian pl@@ ough@@ ed , but he also will find out the core of the entire Arab world . all these subjects will not only find out in cities such as Damascus , Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib could not be restricted to the bound@@ aries of his thinking , and he can communic@@ ate with men under the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it wasn &apos;t open to us , he enjo@@ ys a special upgrade against the US American Foreign Policy .
H@@ da@@ ib considered his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib believes not that his co @-@ feeling for those who are trying to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ ance of the second generation &quot; - so he himself called himself when he was born in Jordan , and has never been living in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life cycle so , &quot; bet@@ ont H@@ da@@ ib .
then he added : &quot; I think so , because I have dissolved a man , while in water dissolved N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ a@@ dan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law pro@@ ves that public consumption of food while Ram@@ a@@ dan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ ib appar@@ ently has a certain weak@@ ness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ al hot Jun@@ it@@ ag did not do little with protest against Islam .
in general , the gap of lu@@ war@@ mer coffee and the sw@@ ades of Kent c@@ ig@@ ars are in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan fe@@ els like a prison in free sk@@ ies , especially when you th@@ rows a look inside the neighbour@@ ing countries .
therefore we avo@@ ids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ a@@ dan water - to walk not in prison .
recently the Ministry of Jordan has canc@@ eled a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , already for the second time .
some parliamentary election organised by the Islamic Act - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - arg@@ um@@ ented that sexual orientation of hom@@ osex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ ar@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional standards of the country is ir@@ resist@@ ed and the main reason for the concert table .
the dep@@ uty and former press spokes@@ person in the Islamic Co@@ alition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; had been cancelled , &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ ers .
many claim that the band in mat@@ ters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m , who gives the old leg@@ itim@@ acy author@@ it@@ arian reg@@ imes in the entire region .
in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Le@@ ila the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive destruction of human rights , &quot; which still decided to use &quot; for an intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be sei@@ zed Rh@@ et@@ or@@ ics , but actually a clear @-@ out reality in Jordan contra@@ dic@@ ally contra@@ dic@@ ts , which occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs plant .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ ib , traditional gender ch@@ tern@@ ess to gl@@ utt@@ led his vision by the fate of arab@@ ic women , who have sex to have sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously low @-@ known wife , whose arms and legs were aston@@ ished up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the count@@ less women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
over the past years , in Jordan , the number of the &apos; Hon@@ our mor@@ de &apos; has increased the in@@ set outside .
human Rights Watch according to its cli@@ max . however , the number of Hon@@ our in 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan was still missing , Jordan &apos;s institu@@ tional infrastructure is missing , to support women , victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on the bre@@ ach control from the year 1954 , women who are subject to the risk of familiar violence , &quot; and for her release is often a lon@@ gl@@ anger bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic effort , as well as the guarantee side of the family is necessary that the woman will happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music is very pleased with great popular@@ ity and is not known for them@@ es , in his country long as tab@@ u .
H@@ da@@ ib was that his work is polit@@ ically , however , however , that he can separate his music that is full of explic@@ it@@ ly appe@@ arances on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
he was talking about me , &quot; says he .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ ib took the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; is the focus on poverty .
the list of songs that are polit@@ ically polit@@ ically , can continue .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ ib released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse was repeated , often :
&quot; you are free , and everybody is it . &quot;
in the further course of the songs , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind market , on which you can get in his words , &quot; that can I want , &quot; be it faith or non @-@ believe , h@@ eter@@ o- or hom@@ osexu@@ ality .
he noticed that there is hardly any one in Jordan on the rights of g@@ ay and readers and that comments on the balance of LG@@ BT + -@@ Individu@@ als still have to be cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya to prove that his comments made from the context , turns and his opinion was cen@@ sored .
&quot; on You@@ tube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a revised version , &quot; says he .
today , H@@ da@@ ib was open to the Arab@@ LG@@ BT + -@@ community and re@@ sign@@ ation the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of hom@@ osexu@@ als do not say to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ ets of the eighth century , which still has remained today thanks to his hom@@ ogen@@ er@@ otic po@@ ems in memory .
H@@ da@@ ib asks : if Abu Nu@@ what was working on behalf of the Kal@@ if@@ en , in the eighth century , you could open about hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ anian not this ?
the actual problem , so h@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian Kingdom there is nothing more new that the government must be deb@@ ated on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence .
even recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service took several former government representatives and members of the teachers , they would have been critical to the comments in social media @-@ critical to the problems with the deep in the land sur@@ prising cor@@ ruption .
in view of its , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert that is only the top of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to have a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ anian .
M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila has now progress for him in a row , but the way of progress - so that there is H@@ da@@ ib - consists of slow , reason@@ ably and interior changes . it is sure that this changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ da@@ ib was ulti@@ mat@@ ely called h@@ da@@ ib , such as million Arab@@ s also , of an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he is not only dre@@ amed to bring his work up to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps the area using music , art and literature of a real and basic op@@ enn@@ ess , and not by bom@@ bs , Stre@@ um@@ un@@ itions and artificial art came down dem@@ ocrac@@ ies . at least , he h@@ opes it .
until it is far as far , H@@ da@@ ib is far more dist@@ orted and therefore also resist@@ ors .
this report was called by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Cris@@ is Rep@@ orting , to the A@@ man as Student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
we susp@@ ected that there is a vari@@ ation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which was also celebrated in August in many op@@ ard@@ ous To@@ ho@@ kus , and from a period of time , in the ar@@ mies from the West Japan , to sett@@ le the indi@@ genous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi near the kne@@ es .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could sleep a couple of great seats , therefore we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , designed a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( lit@@ tl ) .
I &apos;m looking back to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again : two fixed car is just to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only tru@@ ths - and still a breath@@ taking kind and way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was da and I &apos;ve got the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of an 18 @-@ meter high tower car was un@@ belie@@ vable .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , the outer appearance and body care as important as in this history , because they help maintain the per@@ u@@ vian Youth from the Cri@@ min@@ ality and promote an leg@@ itim@@ ate prof@@ ession as the hair@@ dress@@ er .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street children and illegal drug store are daily .
a survey in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population does not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - a rising demand for aest@@ hetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also copy the unusual hair@@ style of famous sport@@ s@@ ors such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Art@@ uro V@@ idal ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led that more standardi@@ zed hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers in the experienced hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers can be found .
the exceptional demand for hair@@ dress@@ ers who go to the outer bound@@ aries of the fant@@ asy and cre@@ ativity , even an annual event inspired by the hair@@ dressing &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held in 2014 .
in each other , experts join each other to show , who can see from them the ec@@ cent@@ rist@@ ic Loo@@ ks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to con@@ vin@@ ce young people against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad weather conditions in the hair@@ past@@ eur@@ ship , which allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated from this activity and the bi@@ odi@@ cal possibilities have seen do@@ zens of young people that they can sei@@ ze a prof@@ ession , which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March , and reported on some of its achievements :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the community and the district , which we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this education community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illas

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the post &quot; love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa figh@@ ters , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution is published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why write we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel themselves out ?
it is exactly this question the two young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation is no longer from the head and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ c@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to re@@ conc@@ iliation ) , the young people to encour@@ aged letters to write gu@@ err@@ illas letters .
recently , the country of a historic event and they wanted to contri@@ bute to their part : after many years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with gu@@ err@@ illas ( german : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the longest of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International is the subject of peace agreement as an important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , in front of the column , however , a long way to talk to a real re@@ conc@@ iliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ ras , who were living for many years in Il@@ legal camps , had been exposed to war r@@ het@@ or@@ ic and around the clock of their weapons in order to integ@@ rate their weapons in life than civilians .
in turn , the Colom@@ bian company again decided to re@@ conc@@ iled to life in constant war and in some cases of deep hat@@ red with gu@@ err@@ illas and must support them in their rows and support them in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and c@@ rist@@ ian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans have to join and would have to help the integration process .
and just that they did also : until now , thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illas in order to welcome them again in the company .
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one of every former gu@@ err@@ illas - which will be delivered to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as in@@ spiration for the Camp@@ aign
the idea for re@@ conc@@ iliation was created on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and c@@ rist@@ ian who had the opportunity to talk short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who love him to write thousands of love letters , but those who forget it necessary .
he plane , told him , in this year his love with men to share the most ur@@ isp@@ y add@@ itives .
so out of the plan , letters full of hope and support for former figh@@ ters of the F@@ ARC to write their place in society , and is preparing a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a joint history of peace . &quot;
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is located in all major cities of Columbus , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that som@@ eb@@ ody would never be for@@ given .
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students of the University J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the City Administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art moved to the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC as they had done before they had done before the commands of their leader .
but this time they received no commands , but letters full of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all participating . &quot; it is un@@ belie@@ vable how many different fe@@ el@@ ings can be carried out in just a few hours - from fear to happ@@ iness and everything that is between , told the polit@@ ician student Manuela J@@ im@@ éne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Govern@@ or of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this mem@@ orable experience such as :
after we had passed the letters , a former officer led me through the bearing of gu@@ err@@ illa figh@@ ters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the gu@@ err@@ illas workers were living ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illas who wrote something .
I had to be afraid , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer &apos; , a dead@@ ly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
and I said , &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; he said , &quot; I answer to a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful cover .
never in my life , someone has never written something so nice , and answer me . &quot; because my te@@ ars suddenly ran over the che@@ eks .
I raised him completely and set me in addition to the pom@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer .
maybe he was the war of lei@@ d , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful compan@@ ions , and wanted to write this letter to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from the life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only possibility to keep him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that som@@ eb@@ ody would never be for@@ given me for my faul@@ ts .
but now I know that there is a society with open arms that wa@@ its for us .
until now I have learned just as I have to go with weapons .
but now there is peace , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ n@@ ity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
for opening there came students and some leader of the F@@ ARC to a discussion round .
the students were all raised as early as the war and the F@@ ARC already existed in the hidden .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave in@@ sight into their views over the Peace nation . now , where we have the opportunity to develop us to create a political party , we can contri@@ bute to the society in this country .
for a goal of this order , it is worth to overcome all obst@@ acles , &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was im@@ pressed :
these people have never heard that yet had never heard that yet had never heard and do not know that people who have seen often as mon@@ ster and even h@@ orted people , even people with beautiful ti@@ dings , who were surrounded by their lives and their environment was very pain@@ ful for me .
the reality , in which the land lives , do me .
but it tru@@ sted me that all people - even those who have killed , and so much damage may have to put us anything , and can give a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former figh@@ ters have delivered to letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the col@@ our@@ ers was made , that after developing peace would rule peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as it in@@ equality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take their weapons , to take care of their rights . and this is also completely just@@ ified ( ... ) .
we use the F@@ ARC on peace , on a politics without weapons .
that is why we call any defense of peace on - no matter of any race , religion , or ide@@ ology , listen to all those who dreams from a country in the war .
we give you our word to make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from my own experience , that nothing is simple to def@@ end the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are coming .
on our way , there will be many obst@@ acles , but together we will overcome them .
a trans@@ wife speaks about the per@@ secu@@ tions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the lives in Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of a article written by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ as@@ sum@@ owa , and its first published in the OC Media website .
hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ er people who are living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are subject to a wide range of d@@ ang@@ ers - including dis@@ cri@@ mination , physical and sexual violence and stress .
with terror , activ@@ ists have experienced the reporting period over the last months over the per@@ secution of sw@@ ine men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on the Dam@@ age group on the dor@@ m LG@@ BT community , is not first formed over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who has dealt some of their experience with us , which has happened in the republic .
LG@@ BT Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered the international impact on several months after several months , having published the to@@ wing , torture and killing que@@ ens men in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ised .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta . she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities that took the susp@@ ects men and they were in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a Monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
already since her childhood , she felt that she was in reality a woman .
when they were grown , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Tsch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender equality of their land , the hunt was opened on Sabrina .
from an@@ xi@@ ety around her life she moved to the United States .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunte@@ er hel@@ pers in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help you , when I thought it would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere in the internet , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men over Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that the pictures taken from my documents by Wh@@ ats@@ app the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was just doing , a couple of shopping m@@ ented by the back of my cars , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing .
then I heard a set , but this time on sh@@ orn : &quot; how long will you honour the family nor honour , you sc@@ and@@ ry ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the awar@@ eness and aw@@ ak@@ ened last En@@ des in the hospital .
appar@@ ently some women had received everything and started writing .
the man was flo@@ wn .
women had a am@@ bul@@ ance .
in the hospital I drove that I had two results in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which nurs@@ ing wings were placed - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name ; but the doctor fell down and laid me on the women .
I am very gr@@ ate@@ ful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as good man .
I am th@@ ank@@ ful to him that he has respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they cried out , I wrote me - rel@@ atives , stran@@ ger , some perfect un@@ known .
that was the beginning of an Alpine trau@@ ma .
my family was attended by neigh@@ bo@@ urs and some remote rel@@ atives .
the demanded that I returned to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that everything was a lie .
they introduced ab@@ sur@@ de claims : some told me that I would prove them above without through the streets ; others wanted to say that I had not changed in the official television in Gros@@ ny , that I had not changed my sex , and Phot@@ oshop .
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what would I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family tries to change this print ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people talked about my mother at the street .
they said to her , &quot; They brought a mon@@ ster to the world , that is not only your family , but the entire republic .
we can &apos;t touch you , because you are a good woman , but you must dis@@ appear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much , and she lay hold a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neigh@@ bo@@ urs came and delivered them .
at the time I had to change several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and just a few hours later , under the window a car with dark@@ ened window discs and a number sign with a 95 .
after the third time it was , I was clear that there was something f@@ au@@ l .
my human rights appro@@ ached the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was per@@ sec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activ@@ ists .
for safety reasons , I will not give their names , but I will say that I have remember@@ ed them all , they have really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belie@@ vable .
I can still re@@ alize , how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it to register without me , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the gar@@ bage .
came in and checked at the hotel .
the number was registered for a stran@@ ger .
I have the SIM card in my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I asked my mother by Wh@@ ats@@ app I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe in safety , just because you have left the country ?
our people know already , in which hotel you know . they even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : stand with your family in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : just with my mother and my sisters .
however , on the gender equality , we didn &apos;t talk , that is a Tab@@ u@@ th@@ ema .
some tradition@@ ally Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements I still live in me .
so very I wish I wish to overcome this se@@ el@@ ical barrier , I cannot overcome .
I say always that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to destroy them .
if we out@@ fit with camera , I give me much effort to see how the person remin@@ ds out of their past , so on my male form .
but that &apos;s very hard .
OC Media : know something about the present location in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who remained d@@ iting ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington on last week .
for I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who won one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that Ram@@ a@@ dan was not arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ a@@ dan could hardly wait for a new wave .
most likely they are now focused on family and rel@@ atives .
so , I invite you to download the rel@@ atives to those who takes care of the problem with the affected person and at the end , the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; caused by blood gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ ation .
OC Media : are now even sw@@ ule men in these secre@@ tions ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says , there are not many of them .
if , in particular , those who have no rich rel@@ atives or those of their rel@@ atives have been added to Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so they can present it later than terror .
say : should they be brought to show her body in television and claim that they would have any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if this man did not simply have disappeared , but targeted to radi@@ alize them .
OC Media : is this now only a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I c@@ ited just someone who was in@@ ad@@ orn@@ ed one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard was grown .
there has been nothing new of them .
they simply have taken them .
and so the so @-@ called Lord , this person was taken away , when these people were taken away .
until now they have not been presented as band@@ its , in addition there were no reports . we guess that such actions are possible .
why otherwise , we could not allowed this man to sh@@ ave ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and dis@@ cover@@ ings of people who heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sabrina : I &apos;ve always contributed my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I guess already before 2003 I was already known in the whole Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria I had never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much saf@@ er than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to bring us to &quot; civ@@ il@@ ization , &quot; ulti@@ mat@@ ely finally rejected us at the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows were p@@ oured ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ids , made tu@@ b@@ ular je@@ ans and short tops .
the security of the Sch@@ aria has never curved to me only a hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , mainly on weekends , a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches arose , and the whole town knew why they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never ins@@ ul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a reproduction : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da , that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fort@@ une of another . &quot;
it often say often to children , if that are fun with sick .
OC Media : so they just locked up their eyes before you , because they believed , you are sick ?
Sabrina : Yes .
they never ins@@ ul@@ ted me never be@@ aten and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this pas@@ sion@@ ate time ?
Sabrina : so long , to Kad@@ y@@ row on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 he began to speak on TV via Mor@@ al .
he said not to us by se , but for the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel as the people began to change in the city .
he who had st@@ acked in advance , and had seen you at a time with arg@@ uments .
in the period I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I am working as a wa@@ ist .
I do not have much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
of it , I still have been active as active activ@@ ist .
I &apos;ve been responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meeting , I join them to hospital and hel@@ ping them to get food types .
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny .
I discovered these people when I flu@@ c@@ ursed im@@ pressed .
I &apos;m Muslims and wants to help those help .
OC Media : wear a Hit@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ bers .
so the nature , that is pure , nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you with foam before the mouth that there is no sw@@ ings on them .
the Dag@@ est@@ ans have those who have the Cab@@ ot , which have Rus@@ sians also have ; on the planet it gives them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant to hear something .
I meet so many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practi@@ ced Muslims who go into the mos@@ que and during Ram@@ a@@ dan fast@@ ing - live together with men .
do you know many think about Tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity of men who love hus@@ bands , and they believe that they changes his sex to make more in@@ time experiences . but this is a tear .
these are two different things - two different types of receiving , to be exact , different hab@@ itat .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not for my body .
not , whether I have a partner or not .
sorry , I &apos;m sorry here , but my last in@@ timate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad , because I know that I am now .
local groups war@@ ns an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ality within the devast@@ ated Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the I@@ ran@@ ian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers under an unusual high unemployment and arm@@ ament within the native Arab population .
for the last months , there &apos;s a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ al .
the photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man called Jas@@ si@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , per@@ ate the dou@@ b@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is influ@@ enced by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Th@@ aw@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z area in the South West of Iran .
he l@@ itt under an@@ xi@@ ety , de@@ pression , and de@@ fle@@ w himself to his own help to come to the in@@ ability of his family , like Ah@@ az@@ i @-@ Human Rights , which would like to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anon@@ ymous .
a mom@@ ents on YouTube kept the mom@@ ents , after he had joined himself , fixed .
some people made it fast to delete fl@@ ames once again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the combust@@ ion were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide , who has changed in August within the Arab@@ ian Ah@@ az@@ i min@@ ority , and activ@@ ists in the spot , that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month are some other - Ham@@ id Man@@ i@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mo@@ uss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hang@@ ed .
their stories they have a thing together : there were all family v@@ ä@@ ter that were on the per@@ secution of the I@@ ran@@ ian government , help and un@@ able to feed their families to feed their family and secure work .
Arab@@ ian Ah@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and dis@@ cri@@ mination
the region , which is part of a large living in Iran living in Iran of Ah@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population .
before a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an mainly aut@@ onomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy took power over power and 1925 great effort to end ethnic aut@@ onomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran last oil and gas fields as well as some of the rich@@ est and most valuable working areas for I@@ ran@@ ian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy is continuing only slowly , and the local population receives only little from this wealth .
it is often vic@@ tim of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and dis@@ rup@@ tions .
the Irish regime denied the Ah@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s system@@ atically jobs in local oil , gas@@ - and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dem@@ ons , the waters of the Arab areas in the Per@@ sian regions where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are .
these dem@@ ons have led only to destroy them in the region by d@@ rought destruction , and the local agriculture as well as fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab@@ ian Ah@@ aw@@ zi adol@@ esc@@ ents now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the I@@ ran@@ ian general director of co@@ operative , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ az@@ is , who completed an work that completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % one university degree .
a &quot; system@@ atic strategy ... which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resist@@ ers &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ imi , an Irish Ah@@ az@@ i @-@ Human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a blend of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ial ethnic dis@@ cri@@ mination , &quot; at a &quot; high increase in the number of self @-@ mor@@ al under the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
Doh@@ imi said that especially the unemployment has become even worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z to come from an upcoming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab dis@@ cri@@ mination in the setting process :
since the functional and institutions , there is no Arab worker force , the local Arab@@ ian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is a part of a system@@ atic policy of the reg@@ imes , which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resist@@ ers of young Arab@@ s and des@@ erve them to earn their hab@@ itat outside of her home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their first@@ - and desc@@ endants to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ az@@ i to hide and so that even Arab@@ ian name will not be toler@@ ated , because the speaking Arab language or tr@@ agen Arab clothing .
in view of the given circumstances which have to bear the Arab ancest@@ or , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait if the world is w@@ aking up and it will be knowledge .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ treated de@@ pression .

the following article is a revised version of comments made by Ay@@ om@@ ide Z@@ uri and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions , in which many different positions were ex@@ changed .
you can be read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who record themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional Fem@@ in@@ istic femin@@ ists .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put a well @-@ thought scientific and social arg@@ uments before me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money and earn less money than men .
however , women still are still under strict observation , if it &apos;s why they are to make her body with her body .
violence against women is a global epidem@@ ic .
or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure that women purchased earlier or later in various areas of life on a gl@@ itter@@ ing ceiling , and that dis@@ cri@@ mination against sex is still passing through many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware , and known .
I &apos;m convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come on skin colors , on rac@@ ism , on black tran@@ si@@ den@@ te women , to black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q @-@ congregation or on black women from Di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I have been ab@@ used , both in and outside of femin@@ ist movement , many white Fem@@ in@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al femin@@ ists .
however , however , all women think that women should come together to raise &quot; their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing , to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexual violence , a institu@@ tional form persist@@ ently motiv@@ ated violence , which we sub@@ jected to black women on two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ics and her@@ mit@@ igation are less des@@ erve than white men and women .
that black girl and girls with a migration of mig@@ rant workers are proven to school as white girls , due to ob@@ vious integration problems .
or that women are exposed in black sphere and women with a migration of a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
in one side , I want to have all men , all men , and all of all men in any skin color ; on the other hand , I can join me as a black woman , which is refused to consider un@@ profit@@ ability in their thinking , which refer to gender as well on the skin color of a person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and become no more about my refuge in a white femin@@ ist @-@ oriented anim@@ osity against me and count@@ less black women always turned down again .
in 1851 , So@@ jo@@ ur@@ ner accused of his speech : &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also ref@@ use me to obtain a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a simple and mar@@ g@@ inal being .
I ref@@ use me to connect my group , which is also absor@@ bed by cultural applications and customs , to pres@@ erve their eg@@ o@@ centr@@ ic program .
I will not try anymore , white women the importance of trans@@ forms of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to try the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to consume a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional Fem@@ in@@ ism was founded in order to give women in a home of different approach to get out of white Fem@@ in@@ ism , and is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I go before , me full and fully tigh@@ tened out of the Fem@@ in@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and mine status as woman , instead of mine for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , that is so tough , that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenom@@ enon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women after our own ideas and give us into the spin@@ ach that we will be created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the Book of Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can def@@ end ourselves to our own type . and not only that - black women can rely on this way , in which they can rely on our own type and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ent to make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional Fem@@ in@@ ists immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and excl@@ usion , after they have read these lines , please inform about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black@@ woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , because in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m exist .
I will be recognised as a woman as a part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ mas due to my dar@@ en skin .
I , a black woman , can bl@@ ossom in a field , in which my life is neither super@@ vised , nor yet to be rejected .

the following article is the short@@ ened and revised version of the article &quot; Die wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Par@@ agu@@ ay &quot; from Kur@@ dish . the article is one of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ten@@ ich@@ ein@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) who reports about women in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
most names were changed to protection of the affected people .
a police Comm@@ ission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ vez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their partner , who had become a member of their work .
since the end of their relationship was passed , and the police said , her statement would be laid for the acts , but could not do more .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was used because of Mis@@ use , there is nothing useful display by A@@ da B@@ á@@ vez .
some days later , the second wife moved its display .
the Teu@@ fel@@ lowship of Viol@@ ence against Women is difficult .
when women are ref@@ uted at all once again , they will not receive support with regard to the Sta@@ ats .
in many cases , the women also depends on the men that they mis@@ use them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who will be ad@@ mit , victims of violence at all in the pro@@ secution of the authorities .
content and Statist@@ ics 2 In@@ visible ab@@ use and an legal system that has nothing under@@ nour@@ ished 3 Par@@ agu@@ ays laws : good approach , man@@ tle implementation be@@ ats and statistics
it &apos;s hard to describe how many women really ab@@ use , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social scientific research institu@@ tion in Par@@ agu@@ ay . &quot; there are different data and reports that are not even ans@@ at@@ ories to show the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Par@@ agu@@ ay . &quot;
but those available , however , are al@@ arm@@ ing .
in 2015 , the District Office of 9@@ 600 ads placed on domestic violence . at 70 % it went to violence against women .
86 % of ads placed by women .
there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence in peace . also 86 % of the ads placed by women .
in the advertis@@ ements they said 40 % of women that they were physi@@ cally mis@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ological ab@@ use .
however , this statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
according to the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only few of these off@@ ences are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who will be ref@@ unded in Par@@ agu@@ ay because of psych@@ ological ab@@ use , 9 women who do not do this .
each woman , which is ref@@ unded because of physical mis@@ use , two women who do not do , &quot; declared her end of 2014 .
since Gyn@@ ex@@ ation in Par@@ agu@@ ay , there is no own offen@@ ders , the pro@@ secution authorities cannot be documented , how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
alone until August 2016 journalists killed at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Par@@ agu@@ ay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered in their current or former partners .
according to its estimates , in Par@@ agu@@ ay , all ten days a woman died due to violence in Par@@ agu@@ ay .

invisible Mis@@ use and an legal system that does not take anything
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he in@@ sist@@ ed that they called his name for all of their former friends .
but at the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then , after that , she should always return to them .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but two years , she contributed the psych@@ ological violence against women , and the most common forms of violence against women , and simultaneously the most dead@@ ly recogni@@ z@@ able :
I &apos;ve never thought that I would have been vic@@ tim to Mis@@ use .
if I read earlier this , I thought that the only woman happens to be lower , because they are affected by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mariana used social media to report about the Mis@@ use by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions to Facebook , in which they described its reward and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he was isolated .
many people responded to their contributions , among them also Carlos himself . he asked r@@ het@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever received the hand against them , and refused to agree that his behavior was also a form of mis@@ use .
other Facebook users question@@ ed Mariana , why they had fallen so long from Carlos , and didn &apos;t leave it earlier .
it seemed almost so , as wanted to say that victims of mis@@ use were at least a certain mit@@ ence .
Victoria Santos , which comes from Par@@ agu@@ ay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Par@@ agu@@ ay , to prove that their former partners miss her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) which consists of women that are all in any way victims of Mis@@ use .
in the group , they can talk about their experiences , listen to each other and support mut@@ ually .
you do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women .
in Vic@@ tori@@ as Case started everything with psych@@ ological ab@@ use .
her we@@ alth@@ y partners finally managed to con@@ vin@@ ce them that they were valuable .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tori@@ as ads placed on the authorities without score and also from their rel@@ atives , she received no support .
she led a trial against their former partner who developed into an imm@@ en@@ vious legal struggle between Par@@ agu@@ ay and their home country , where it went mainly by money , power , and influence their former partner .
Par@@ agu@@ ays laws : good approach , man@@ tle implementation
&quot; in Par@@ agu@@ ay there are many laws , which are very well but not applied .
the display of Mis@@ use is a way of withdraw@@ al and a fight against cor@@ ruption in the justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ aur@@ i , a representative of the UN organization for women in Par@@ agu@@ ay , looks great problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Für@@ st@@ ink ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ In@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original study of the law looks to explain Fem@@ iz@@ id in an independent criminal off@@ ences and har@@ der as it is already in the neighbour@@ ing countries of Argentina and Bolivia is the case .
the legisl@@ ative text was changed in some points to win the MP@@ s for the law , that fe@@ ared the way for dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating of abor@@ tions , which are pro@@ hib@@ ited in Par@@ agu@@ ay , and will be pun@@ ished by up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had been planned , most of the ( bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) , which have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they simply add only ad@@ ress and secure accommodation , to re@@ alize the state .
Ech@@ aur@@ i arg@@ uments that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature doesn &apos;t have any compensation of financial resources available :
in Par@@ agu@@ ay , Mis@@ use is seen as part of forced relations .
there must be a thinking about that violence is no longer regarded as a little Nor@@ mand@@ y .
who in view of these facts , he is found guilty and contri@@ butes to that the per@@ pet@@ rator of the per@@ secution will come .
we must out@@ fit so long display , until mission is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law adopted the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , and one of the passage was cancelled , that the partner in cases of domestic violence against re@@ conc@@ iliation .
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section of re@@ conc@@ iliation was seen as an opportunity for Ag@@ g@@ ress@@ or , his sacrifice again .
however , the cancellation of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a large back@@ lash .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , shown in picture with his understanding
medical research in Africa is not mentioned in the media only rarely or not mentioned . there are a growing area that ad@@ ore one of the most urg@@ ent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need of medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of health care , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have far more gra@@ ined impact than el@@ se@@ o , and lack of investments in research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a great problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists itself is carried out in Africa . a bigger role of science and technology can only be instrum@@ ental in the economic growth of the continu@@ ity only .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Research of inf@@ ecti@@ ous disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ecti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s at Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidem@@ ic of the first severe imp@@ acts on national health .
he left Zambia for a student in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the university of Pennsylvania , he himself spent on HIV @-@ virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ische health@@ care system .
with global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed over the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ understanding of media about these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laborat@@ ories .
in addition , I just rigid a research program for developing molecular tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pat@@ ho@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion based on your opinion in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they di@@ ffer from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research . we are only solutions to have been developed differ@@ ently .
that must change , otherwise we will always stay the reci@@ pi@@ ent instead of myself .
the solutions that we get , are often not used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
G@@ V : where is the financing and assistance ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it &apos;s to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are encour@@ aged different .
it is difficult to find people who will come back or come here , for financing and development of development in other countries are better .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obst@@ acles are in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs plenty of money to have continuous supplies with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries .
G@@ V : how does the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are to be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the Potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there are demand on special scientific training , starting at every age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of world @-@ confidence , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and growing diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are very benef@@ ic@@ ial .
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the distinc@@ tive access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that journ@@ als are only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ ment &quot; ) , limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : as &quot; Open Source &quot; plant producers to change worldwide food production .
this entry of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about the solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been bre@@ d already since the 1980s in the USA Sal@@ ad .
his company offers 114 varieties such as out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant , built by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been used .
almost 20 years of work was Mort@@ g@@ ated work only by his own income and the question how many sal@@ ads may get it , bound@@ aries .
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he knew that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them for further to bre@@ d .
the pat@@ ents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green leaves .
over the last years , more of such pat@@ ents have been registered for more plants , such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant breeding and experts for food security concerns the future of food production .
as a pas@@ sion@@ ate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still needs salad , he needs longer , since its work is still more restri@@ ctions on more restri@@ ctions .
&quot; it is when I lie in a river , in order to lie down .
so we have to make this now , but it is a fr@@ action with the tradition that says . &quot; I think that these pat@@ ents go to sal@@ ads . &quot;
and if they with@@ stand before the dish , no one can be able to bre@@ d more a new sal@@ ads because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it so good as possible , trying to cover those characteristics that he would like .
however , it is very careful and man@@ ned to use no material that is being protected as a spiritual property .
it also has a motion , which is always larger in the USA and throughout the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; trains ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have bre@@ d red Rö@@ mer@@ salad of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; Green@@ house &quot; of the station . it will be tested if plants can be built in space .

it &apos;s no co@@ incidence that this name might sound so sound , as the movement would come from the IT sector , and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; Sa@@ at@@ gut ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , altern@@ atives to ur@@ ably protected software .
it was called to life in order to ensure that some plant species and has not been protected as spiritual own@@ ership and so for plan@@ ter permanently .
as part of the initiative , OSS@@ I called OSS@@ I , US @-@ Bre@@ e@@ ders may agree that other things can be bre@@ d free from them .
this does not do that they do not want to do with her seed and do it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ e@@ ders allow you to cross their seed , it &apos;s not to bre@@ ach their own varieties - two aspects that pro@@ hib@@ ited by many vegetable pat@@ ents or .
do@@ zens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
d@@ üst@@ ere pro@@ spects
for the emer@@ gence Professor of Wisconsin Mad@@ ison and OSS@@ I @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed @-@ good and the opportunity to bre@@ ed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
Sa@@ at@@ good plays an role in larger projects such as bi@@ odi@@ versity , rights of pe@@ as@@ ants , control over the nutritional system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to use the latter , or just little while using seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ ressed that the &quot; Open Source &quot; movement did not work with intelligent plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables , grain , gent@@ lem@@ ically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; if you want to buy any more frequently enco@@ unter@@ ed vegetables in the global agricultural industry , we should know that the species is offered to the markets , should also know that the way is bre@@ d to themselves , like this vegetables is bre@@ d .
dietary so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty without seed soli@@ d@@ ity is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative is oblig@@ ations to provide other seeds down to their seed . thus , its predecessor in contrast , seed and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i sub@@ contrac@@ tor arg@@ uments that the future of food supplies may end@@ ang@@ ered , since the Su@@ it is available due to abund@@ ant intel@@ lec@@ tual property rights due to the always paid intel@@ lec@@ tual property rights , which is always limited to limited .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Fac@@ ulty of OSS@@ I , has resulted in their doc@@ toral thesis with gen@@ et@@ ical vari@@ ation with carrots and their availability . she found that about one @-@ third of all cart@@ ons is protected as a spiritual property , making it not only use for plant breeding .
for other plants , these estimates are not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by avo@@ ided that mass@@ acres of the vegetable plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots .
a question of view
plants become so bre@@ d that they are targeted features - of such that their taste or their colour has improved until these , due to those of which they keep in certain environments , such as p@@ ests and diseases .
opp@@ onents of pat@@ ents on vegetable properties indicates that the available plant material for bre@@ eder over more pat@@ ents . genetic diversity is currently necessary as ever before , as the changed terms are fore@@ se@@ ed@@ ingly due to climate change .
in an email @-@ to @-@ speaking Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto , that genetic diversity is generally important and also cru@@ cial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . having a total of four gen@@ ases and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of the United States set up the company for the con@@ servation of genetic diversity .
they contra@@ dic@@ ted , however , that intel@@ lec@@ tual property other bre@@ eder , as &quot; Pat@@ ents and the Protection of Plant varies by innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent was taken in the bas@@ ically a plan which can follow once the patent expired .
often these instructions will help others , with another method to come to the same result .
such more protection in@@ hib@@ its innovations not , but promot@@ es the public more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent loop , do not have any innovations .
and if you have been waiting for a long time to bre@@ ed plants , they have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , would have been lost the battle .
but the main argument of Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always been a general well @-@ gener@@ ous , and it also should remain : &quot; independent plant breeding have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ables are not attractive for us .
we want to facil@@ itate its work easier .
this is what makes us drives and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
altogether , Mort@@ on is dist@@ orted to the concept of themselves , plant features : &quot; we created the characteristics not really itself .
the plants form them out and as bre@@ eder we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and OSS@@ I @-@ board member , there is also another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who cultiv@@ ates a variety , also bre@@ d his own values in them .
those who believes in the industrial agriculture with large courtesy and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for their cultiv@@ ation mass@@ es her@@ b@@ ital needs to be bre@@ d in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is accurate . &quot;
while some medium businesses ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) pat@@ ents have to sur@@ vive the most smaller seed companies , even without pat@@ ents - either re@@ ject the pat@@ ents or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not wor@@ th@@ while or both is the case .
in his breeding gardens , Frank Mort@@ on looks back to Sal@@ ad &apos;s breeding gardens .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that Bre@@ aking through the avoid@@ ing of vegetable pat@@ ents would be innovative : &quot; it looks like that I would have to produce new efforts to produce new effort , more powerful than the company .
I need a new material for my catalog , as I know that my compet@@ itors are to sell my varieties in a few years himself , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent for 20 years before competition , where@@ with it is just fine to my opinion , &quot; worldwide res@@ on@@ ance
though the United States seem to be leading to the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept spread out quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Development &quot; ) describes himself as a professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; plant breeding program works the center with farmers and helps them to reduce new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports &quot; Open Source &quot; Sa@@ at@@ good to come and sell their own .
the German organization war@@ col works on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ulti@@ mat@@ ely represents a formal and legal form of OSS@@ I @-@ commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( regulations for the bre@@ e@@ ches di@@ ffer from land to land , due to the OSS@@ I oblig@@ ation not just one in one in Europe or other parts of the world can be taken . )
in early November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows pat@@ ents to the conventional plants .
however , a explanation is still no law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States , to bring to this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference to &quot; open source &quot; plant breeding systems and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend to spon@@ sor@@ ing seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; Program for &quot; Open Source &quot; conference systems that the organization is currently expanding a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; Sa@@ at@@ ric systems , for the planned next year of the official launch of the official start .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada , and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and bi@@ odi@@ versity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a sa@@ at@@ gut map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and other - a report published that country conf@@ usion must have to come on seed and improve the sa@@ at@@ hab@@ itat , thus a stable supply of food safety can be ensu@@ red .
in the report also the importance of a varied , local supply with seeds good for sustainable food systems emphas@@ ises - a connection , by the Lu@@ by von OSS@@ I h@@ opes that soon it will be det@@ ect more people .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has not@@ ified especially on it , and how slightly att@@ ained , and sa@@ at@@ hab@@ systems have hardly any role played , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to declare the human being even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of the zen@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities in the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ned .
on the weekend about the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government adopted the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents the human rights viol@@ ations in Egypt and the Arab world and the sel@@ b@@ last reports .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , which critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step @-@ sharp critic@@ ised the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information stay in spite of this attack and the Constitution by the authorities , def@@ end the law and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never so important like now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities had to overcome the pl@@ enti@@ ce to overcome the pl@@ enti@@ re@@ ation and do not ad@@ mit it to meet our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first scen@@ ic website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities before more than two months 21 websites block@@ ed , as b@@ sp@@ as the independent telec@@ omm@@ unications site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking issue of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , in addition to the blog of the Columbus and Human Rights , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of Columbus and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now , the blog , which he established himself to pass the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ ator of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
Blogger , the provider in the also includes Zi@@ adas blog is , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , having been arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while exercis@@ ed over the students prot@@ ests against two students .
his article turned himself mainly by politics and human rights in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment on the pl@@ ough@@ s in a Facebook comment on the pl@@ itudes through the government and reflec@@ ting what this means for him :
the b@@ logs is very old but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi , but even if the locking of the b@@ logs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to prove me the feeling of a si@@ ege to determine ; an arrest , a temp@@ ted murder , pre@@ loading of the national Security Council , the pl@@ unge b@@ logs and any other web site that I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I didn &apos;t have anything else . in other words , my words have an impact if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used to go to the post of articles , to go to the zen@@ ship .
but now after they have closed him , and that they may be afraid of words , I can change the link or create a second blog .
the Mu@@ ch move the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) lock@@ able Egyptian authorities of 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this took technical tests to various internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TER documented the pl@@ aster of providers that was possible through transformation of Internet en@@ ap@@ or@@ ship and private sur@@ fers , so @-@ called Virtual Private Net@@ works ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12th we felt like the pl@@ itudes of websites that we offer V@@ PN@@ s .
a such practice indicates the inten@@ tion of government , continue to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users .
the situation will be det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated by means that the c@@ ens@@ ity deci@@ ding behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , resulting in front of judgment against this actions .
now the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the zen@@ ship and who will attack them in next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?

day for day we report newspapers in the whole of Brazil with daily com@@ edy from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to a large post sheet scale .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school was shot , &quot; every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ ie@@ ves pharmac@@ ies with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er k@@ icked 8500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force after Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis , in the middle of the economic crisis , the Ge@@ wal@@ de 2017 has reached the highest stand for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called the United Nations even to attack the United Nations .
reports like these are all daily and this is in@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local paper .
for the detailed reporting of Viol@@ ence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the head of &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; war in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now released there .
the mot@@ ifs of its decision explained the newspaper says :
extra will continue to report about crimes , who will happen in any big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex , etc . everything , however , is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so we did not leave our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ity .
in a four @-@ minute video based on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Guedes , the editor of editor of the newspaper stated that this decision was no reason for pri@@ de , but rather a sign of the failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ an in a country which does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist discovered that , according to the information of the Institute for interior safety in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas which will be controlled by criminal organizations .
in the edit@@ orial article the newspaper writes :
it is consci@@ ous that a war dis@@ course if he is dist@@ orted , also can be used , Gr@@ aus@@ am@@ ities of the police , who may dep@@ orted and then answers to distri@@ bute questions .
but we def@@ end the war based on information and fight against cor@@ ruption in police , whose aim is not the civ@@ ilian population , but the economic power of Maf@@ ia and its partners .
does the designation &quot; war &quot; more than they are supported ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il arg@@ um@@ ented the journ@@ alism in Cec@@ ília . this is their opinion according to a just@@ ification of the failed security policy through the media and could cause it to avoid responsibility for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of cor@@ ruption and poor planning - like Extra by the analysis of the military personnel in Rio itself - in combination with un@@ enough investment in staff , declaration and historical and self @-@ pleas@@ ures of public services .
reminder : the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s state is bigger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , according to Cec@@ ília is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are located according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . this is the latest available data .
there is no these cities in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look forward to the da@@ iry of the state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; it writes .
extra belongs to the company Glo@@ bo , the largest media companies South America , which , such as Cec@@ ília , has been repeat@@ edly repeated for years .

in a night in autumn of 1994 , the conqu@@ est Afgh@@ ans began by the T@@ ali@@ ban .
two years before , a terri@@ ble civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group who had defeated the short @-@ time pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a country of terror and des@@ pair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of Gh@@ az@@ ni in Central Afgh@@ an istan on the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother was not so said , she knew that she would not see her son very long , maybe even more .
in the morning gray , the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would bring him up and bring him to the locks .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , who was dominated by Haz@@ ara &apos;s leader of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , who was murdered by T@@ ali@@ ban , and found many haz@@ ara .
the T@@ ali@@ ban was closer to her H@@ ass on the Haz@@ ara well @-@ known T@@ ali@@ ban .
many haz@@ ara ev@@ acu@@ ate the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found themselves in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ anger . the work was difficult and made him sick .
then he took this , which was left out of his low rate , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and to@@ wing bags with mort@@ ars who were heav@@ ier than he himself to earn his life .
at that time , life Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was min@@ ted by El@@ end and explo@@ itation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , where we also worked .
there was no other services and no heating . we hang@@ ed nylon before the open window , that we should not be refresh@@ ed . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities turned down his asylum request , A@@ wa@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af hom@@ eless , ran only through the streets of Rome , sle@@ pt in parks , and went to a church that lasted twice a day food for extra need@@ y .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high rein@@ de@@ er quot@@ as a kind of second chance for expired asylum applic@@ ants . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers in the country are pre@@ dis@@ ast@@ rous .
the Human Rights Organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transpar@@ ency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special recording centers . it is impro@@ vised by impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can be al@@ located just a recording center if it officially have a request for asylum seek@@ ers , which can be moved out after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
until then , people who have no money for one accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road .
so it also erg@@ ing them .
but his infin@@ ite life helped A@@ shar@@ af from these conditions soon .
after having made several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af had his entire savings in Venice in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so well that he opened a second hostel and a sn@@ ap .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venet@@ ian luxury - a haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 already for the 24th time .

the conditions for entrepren@@ e@@ urs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bure@@ au@@ cr@@ acy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obst@@ acles .
according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans lives in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
over the last few years , some of Afghanistan were produced by Afghanistan , including s@@ log@@ gers , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even successful in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff were mostly from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ iz@@ zeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets range , however , far beyond the Italian gast@@ ronom@@ y industry and retail funds in addition to the country that he had to leave the land as teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers in the är@@ m@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent the half of the company and have to get the same possibilities like all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af co@@ ves plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , who can sell packaging and preserv@@ ation techniques . &quot; so , they can sell their harvest on the market and improve its financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a trip through un@@ certain@@ ty and dou@@ b@@ ts , but at the end there are stability and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip itself . now he would like to help another Afgh@@ ans on this way .

the Egyptian Parliament reviewed a bill , which suggest@@ s that users can also use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after a registration at a government agencies .
users would have to be able to use social networks , within six months after the most successful legislation on the website of the authority under its full name as well as their identification number .
he dis@@ missed this step , could be sentenced to six months of prison or sentence of a Trial sentence .
the law , which was advert@@ ised by six@@ ty parliamentary elections , is currently the legisl@@ ative as well as the constitu@@ tional committee of the parliament , and to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , one member of members filed a bill to be introduced in the toug@@ her pen@@ ance of the President or a high civil servants .

if the law should be adopted , this might be up to three years in jail for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would cause a political climate in which the right to free expression of expression and tra@@ iling freedom has been in danger for many years .
a promin@@ ent example is case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Abo Z@@ id ( known as Sh@@ aw@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstr@@ ates violence against demonstr@@ ators , who led against the military coup against the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .

do China wants to boost the users of social media , to rule its identification ?
according to new regulations of the Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval , before they write messages in social media or share .
in the regulations , the registration with the full re@@ bels will be required .
