<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would live for the first time there.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is exceptionally large.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have read on American music, American writers and its sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a great profound effect on me that I became mainly due to a American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When a 14-year-old I saw the awesome Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered by Julia Roberts as a Jura student, who covered the Supreme Court of oil, who wanted to do his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was' s, as if the absolute truth is, forgot anything else, this is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose variety can be so welcoming that you are always that you are, and it is easy to find in a community of equality people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very weak love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the stranger and racism this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of its ascending is for me, as he is dealing with his engagements.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and explains only publicly his conviction for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people are reacted to his statements and beaten him in swears for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won in the republican elections, was the highest number, which ever achieved by the Party of nominized candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was linguished.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these biglot, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could cause Trump and his voters not accord with people in line, which I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism, people from all over the world, a deep glasting man, with whom I could keep me about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also voted "Cincinnati Inquirer, created by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "not part of the world.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met us at our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours thus to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also found in contrast to the generosity, which I struggling with Sandy Bahr from the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who was treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still works with the dedication of Kristi Kappes that helped me with much patience and grace to me, and my colleagues helped us to conciled the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who have helped me a lot of my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those caused by her shortened values found my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While carrying out his way to the nominate republican Presidential candidate, they subscribed to me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The meditation with the idea that people have voted for trump, because they were either his racism and Fanatism, or because they were willing to watch these things, almost the heart broke.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to draw the trump sum voters as grass.</seg>
<seg id="34">People to arrange, said one of my friends, exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficially and respectless and suggests a capability to understand those who act on a different kind and way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters are, of which most know are, for Trump, because they want to win the control of a country that she disappointed it?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to take a man with contempt on those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm. of SC.: as much as "rejection of the White and whicheash, what a lot means such as pain-trauma), as the Great Van Jones named, did exactly what happened in America so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people over the world appreciated the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have seen, America is every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because this country chose the president, twice the son of a Keno, his story, as he says, nowhere in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, Donald Trumps's choice is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says: to Hell to Hell, religion and the whole term of Pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas, after 9 / 11, the white man will say again on Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all of whom I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation to Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the human quantity.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The amount answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" I felt the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos will take place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out, and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who is not so is like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a voice and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with words: "God be thanks, Mr. Trump, isn't it to your America." 36 hours later he was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country that had fallen his son, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all people who look like Mr. Khan, could no find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero church in the Province of Oaxaca in the town of Oaxaca in the city of Cataura in the province of Oaxaca?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that played at both locations is not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a great garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby precolonial Ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, the La banda de Música (Music Festival) plays in the community: one of children and adults consist of symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school school with 100 students is become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, which is located in one of the oorest provinces Mexican, is known for their drugs-abuse and the banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this was changed after a random meeting with a French pilots, who started a musical project and commanded the youth so much hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very serious, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run home and immediately after lunch running them through the dust of its great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and watch with brilliant eyes and play in the bustle you for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Müll</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically located on the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - on instruments that are made from revaluation waste materials:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments that consist of local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under the direction of Favio Chávez began to walk parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitise violines, violas, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez remembered a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the starting time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no space to rehearsed, and we did not hesitate to contact the parents in the garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact her parents, because many of them did not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a waste came out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a complete orchestra, which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">Documentation of the "Landfill harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tonnes of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the troubles - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra by his inspiring spectacle from the garbage music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and team work successfully fought the illegal fishing industry</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combat the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for common use.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already been operated in liberian waters of illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were raised to this way, and have little gends to welcome a legals of this kind to their coastal welcome.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to put one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permit to him.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" however, Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan Fisheries. he is part of a team that discovered the ship, and followed.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the region. it was not managed to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of a pillage of fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative which protects the criminal traineers and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, in 2012 by the NRO Stop, illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, which had been driven by the Prime Minister out of its waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" so we have eight countries that are evenly and work together. they are facing each other, where it's illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of Pew CHARITABLE Trusts Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is taken, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to make it extremely difficult, so the illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the estimated defaulting laws, using the specific habitats and types of protected, the illegal fishing systems can be protected, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during their actions against illegal fishing hurdle, and also through the Schneckerempo, with the information between individual countries, these actions are now in real-time, with foldable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There may include the individual countries, for example lists existent licences, news for suspected activities or details that had noticed during a liability or read.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i persecuted the activities of ships also very attentively, if these are move on the open lake, with satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to know ships to know ships which in banned regions - about such a ship shows that a boat loads on other ships on the other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideals, such studies show whether the participating ships have a fish roller, where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can be denied on basis of this information about the acceptance of such vessels in their harbours, meaning that the ships could not be able to sell their cargo, as opposed to the figures of penalties, as in case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" a significant financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal catch is not worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="118">And this is what we want to reach is "" says Per Erik Bergh, conducting director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a mountain-company dedicated to fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also featured FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created, estimated to win 20 million USD each year, who lose the eight members of the Networking HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen who enter in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industry, due to the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. under these, those of Illegal Fischer.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among their practices and actions, as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensed papers, specification of imagination names, the fishing protected species and the fish in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-lasting control system," says Long. "" "" "" "" she could not say a ship illegal and a country. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me "" "" "" "" "and exactly this legals tried to complete the FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been discriminating networks, which was counterfeit licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has persecuted ships and found it.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime", "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system to help the FISH-i, suspected ships of precise ships.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed continually, helps to snails the illegal vessels to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the Illegal Fischer use very raffed techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO which offers well with fisheries and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch to automatically identify their automatic identification systems, wherewith them can't be used by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that links the various information gathered together. it is to help FISH-i to help transcriminating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But, FISH-i's Team African nations are actually impact on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes it.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth is opened together with Google and the sea protection organization Oceana opened the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by the position of each single-foldable shipes worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "merged with neighbours to get a better picture of it, who is what where does - that's just sense," he says. "" "" "" "" here is a chance to join them to use their resources to examine their resources. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on global level. "" Pew CHARITABLE Trusts has a similar project to run a global system for the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are evidence that FISH-i's Activities are not only criminers, but they are also going down.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously made earlier without licence and hardly any consequence we know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of them participated in FISH-i involved a 33% increase in fishing turnover, ever since fishing boats are more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board of drag, their use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries noticed this successes. "" the effect is strongly that we have become other countries. "" "" "" "" says Kiilu. "" "" "" "" we disappear every year several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined to the so-called West Africa Task Force, since exactly the same model such as FISH-i. "" with safety is the aim to make more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent affililand Somalia report its first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship which was under false flag and was not only used to go without license and were banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still inhibited in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" "" "" with the niche of dimensional rules against Greko 1, "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof of the oceans works in the entire world. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes on the topic of the environment, technology and diet.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is a adapted version of an interview of Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was completed on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to join the tombs in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine town of Córdoba, in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said within the frame of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba for his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not find his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the office, such names like his father contribute to the brutal military operations in La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secretly for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magical.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you don't know that it is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, folklore and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, his father was Deputy Commander of the secret service department of 141 in La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archiving extension.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the history of Luis Quijano, the oppression that is charged with torture in the 158 cases, torture and murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced in the course of the fact that he had experienced in the course of the years that he had experienced a young father against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">Its history shows what great power is a parent about his child and like this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the Sporthalle to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I was often looking for us into the sports hall. I had a little girl with a boy, the martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black and white photo, and called me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said,</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a siblong, but you hit you with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Passport watch it, that they will not lead you a day, and I will save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The Abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Labor Party.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he commanded me to go back into the Sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would be foolish.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for example, my father had passed me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy the papers that had heard prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: University connections, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propagility material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">"the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla with - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he made me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to get off. he led me to a Baracke, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - simply all possible - standing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small bouquet of a blanket with a blanket of a blanket. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clump in silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the Baracke, where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he retired on an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I entered and saw a couch, tortured on humans.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fortified the one end of an Kabels. the other end was fastened at the body of the person which was straight there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They are rare with handcuffs to bed, overthrew him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts to the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stiff was drunk there... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body in need is not.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked me, How is it possible that a man can do a lot?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners with handcuffs and were bursed.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilians who was also charged in the process) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a series of mattresses, on which naked people were greeted with the face - all were on hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the intervention, people still rise to the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noticed that I said to the prisoners, he said, "What guilt thou so, Assloch?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I have encountered, "Why have you brought me good?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were cast into a pit and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that, because my father told her house.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra some rooms were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero put together a man and killed there.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to the survival of civilians) Jorge Romero was indicted by the La Perla-Ribera process in La Perla-Ribera process, the students Raúl Mateo Molina.</seg>

<seg id="263">If you look at the map that they took about this way and tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here were changed to their names and was assigned to a number of trial recess.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture of torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the arrangement of the above, that they should be moved.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - Euphemism - for calculating human beings and disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought me all possible things with home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea that the "waryield" - as they knew it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later to the military, I was in the Gendarmerie - it was clear that war yield a bayonet or perhaps the military bases, which one receives an enemy who fought an enemy.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if you go into a house and the refrigerator, the turntables, clothing, paintings, money... and then it is not a warfare, vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I've always asked me like my father, the leader of the security forces, in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also a officer at the Gendarmerie and I would never enjoyed it to steal in a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminals and I answered: and you did meet cars on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no criminer?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded about rage, struck me and cried:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far away, I'll find you and place you.</seg>
<seg id="283">In addition we need no other!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no only good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo of back then on which I had a jacket and a rolling stock of wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he didn't have clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence asked me, a co-disappeared during this crime. I said no problem, they can lay me on load what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was anyway, to speak out.</seg>
<seg id="290">"the disappearances of the Lyre is the last disguardians'</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I find remorse.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if you have children only once children, we know the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One developed further and detects that it is false to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went to say to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">So well, you have joined the dictatorship during the dictatorship. but what disappear to disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidding?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with home, whose mother was killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was as our pet, almost as a dog - just that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always turned the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could simply take them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but what to disappear their bodies?</seg>
<seg id="302">Had these people not too families who could have been handed over to their remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearances of the corpse is the last departs, which can do a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when the democracy was introduced again, they revamped machines to eliminate the extinct remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were mashed and somewhere else - no idea, where. "one will never find something," said my father. "</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains of course.</seg>
<seg id="307">'I have seen how you have killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to clear it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was even at the Gendarmeria.</seg>
<seg id="310">Just I just told the truth about 20 crime - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought, in my father, was originated during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him preceding for all of the greetings, which I had to see.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said: "I don't know. I did not have killed."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt with compassion and asked me when the entire Patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings," which they allegedly defended it, actually was good.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you say something to me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you have killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed awful crime, committed me as a child, and you didn't have a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">He said, "Oh well, I don't show me."</seg>
<seg id="320">Exactly that I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010, I refunded the first message.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally knew that he was a crusher.</seg>
<seg id="323">Nobody can be told me that I am voreingenommen. I finally said to my own father.</seg>

<seg id="346">Machining of the original photos of Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers have been a newly opened centre in which one can extend its leader in the last month witnesses of a very particularly missile translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word, the "older" driver "was resolved, which means" older drivers "means, perhaps - maybe even with evil backrest & # 8212; as" terrific motorbikers "was translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The false translation was from 1-20 September to electronic ads in the input and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">The original photos of Joshua Levine, which was divided into social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake had been the translator Julian Holmes, a population of Kyotos, it was also that the localtimings made it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto daily Kyoto Shimbun daily was:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This shows that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is a reward for older people and in an international city like the Kyoto, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The defective English translation was initially removed. the name "terrible generation" (German: "feared car driver") was later replaced by the appropriate, if also the program was not very correct called "Elder Phase" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture for the translation error. still, it declared that the error was already in the text, they did not have been tested by the translators and that the translation was not checked before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger was reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"it really sorry that older people felt through the inadequate correction (the translation)," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News is slightly more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrific" elder motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" has been listed as an unreasonable description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, which are cultivated in accidents, but are reason for worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture for example, 1.941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a proportion of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1,803 from a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus their share increased to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents have fallen in total, the share of senior citizens caused the same period in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The naming not called Reporter brought in to Yahoo released version of the article comments to the light, show that some Japanese are apparently against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo on the translation error received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" terrific motorbikers ") about do not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">- "Thus is not the translation is not, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't find that this is a real translation error."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two major skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to translate him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active statement of the target language - something that's in the womb. in general, the conviction is that translator in the target language - not in the initial language - native language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French mother tongue should translate from English to French, not from the French translator into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as a native language to translate into English. this may be lacking understanding for the translating, cost-green or the relatively small number of English motives, who learn Japanese to withal.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees have been able to produce peacekeeping. then, the Japanese people will be able to translate translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The veraging and smoother phrases which can be created by machine translation, show that this technology is still no human translators. this applies to some languages quite particular.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, among them also the rams are often used for T-Shirts or bags, only from stylish reasons - not to be understood or understood not.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation error may be acceptable or cheer as jewellery or at least harmless. but of large enterprises or from the government who have to ensure a higher standards, you can expect a more serious translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serial source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a great family with little money goes to their mint-year-old daughter, or her mindery daughter to another, enrichest family. in the swap, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned, is that the children will be uncounted for countless days, which will never be paid and sacrificed by abuse and abuse - and all that can't be able within the context of a contract that cannot be raised.</seg>
<seg id="425">In Paraguay, this regarded as Criadazgo, in Paraguay, due to its participation and acceptance of large parts of society, and despite abundant complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completion of their studies, Alvarenga lived a few years for an organization that battles for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">In particular, she said with Criaditas, especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, rebuked and prangers.</seg>

<seg id="499">Bill writes Egyptian users in societal media, to register at the government</seg>
<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently filed a bill to "regulations regarding conservation and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When it is accepted by Parliament, social media must register for social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law then it would be set up a place that was commissioned to provide citizens and citizens with permission to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the acceptance of the law, users would have to register on the site with their right name and staff numbers to register social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">Will it dismissed this, that could bring a punishment of up to six months in prison or a cash buck.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragles and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media than "jedwede application that runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is passed if it is assumed that the draft would not be able to register as the Egyptian authorities that will not register for those who are to register for those who are not able to register before the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on stage of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, member of the Law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name for a user name and a password to come by the Firewall, Facebook blocked the Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to make a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those would be to submit to the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it's not known to know that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts in front of the site are skeptical regarding technical feasibility.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologies (in German "Executive Committee") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights,") told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I will be strong at the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">According to my opinion, it is so important that as they are certain physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take her, then it means that they may apply a strong monitoring system to apply for citizens, or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people, and also to execute a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically realistic - but in Egypt is all possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the design will initially be discussed at the Legislative of Parliament and the Constitutional Court before it goes into the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and dification is successful, or not, the design "stands in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament, whose senses shall be maximized and ensured that no other fool has been present on the image area." says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the past year, Tamer El-Shahawy struck a bill against Cyber-crime against those who was planned for those who have been found guilty to threaten "public order" and "to protest to protest."</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the leopard leopards, which include Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they always find less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of Leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "the Persian leopies is in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and the thought of the ecosystems has also depends on that a large prebtier is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The probability to see a Persian leopard in the free wild boggan is low and goes to zero. as the team in the video therefore, that they have a recording of a great cat in the camera, the Raza breaks out pleasure in pure pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologin shows Raza passionate a different side of their country, which does not only consist of war and conflict.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made by the North East Japan were affected by the life of those who were affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Prefecture Miyagi was one of the prefectures in Japan's northeast who had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had all coastal towns of the country card.</seg>
<seg id="547">The prefecture of Fukushima living in the Fukushima prefecture had to leave their homes for 160 000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows a local view that had been reached after six years later to rebuild the life of the local companies.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese revival authority as well as a survey results of the affected itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that by the end of December 2015, 77 percent of the planned replacement homes (in, arrang, saigai kouei juutaku) was completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the greatest success among the three prefectures, Miyagi could have been finished here 80 percent of the planned replacement.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light to around 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">For example, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by containers (in the catalytic converter, kazetsu juutaku) are confidated.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in containers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still life in emergency, whereas Miyagi had been successful in a successful months. more than 75 percent of the evacuated that were displaced after the disaster in containers, were moved in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools have been affected by the disaster, their gates have again opened up to December 2016, which strengthens nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi have been restored into operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishermen have been restored its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have moved into three prefectures in agriculture in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could reproduce 93 percent of his agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the farmers in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only one episode of nuclear warn is about 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima, lie in the "nuclear stop zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism has recovered again, but also the Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 per cent on the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima should only be 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reported that since the disaster almost half of the coastal population, it is more difficult to earn their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquakes?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete image, the newspaper resulted in numerous responsibilities under the native population and under the evacuated. she asked them about the state of the re-building and even as their indignation can be changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article explains the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a questionnaire to bring over the tsunami consciousness under the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of the population resident measures taken measures taken in order to be prepared in the future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough for disasters of catastrophes was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As to those who stands the prefecture of Fukushima prefecture had to be evacuated</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue as the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuated aus Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima, even witness of the worst, catastrous phenols, atomic accident often had to experience in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved into areas outside prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent substitute houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophenols, most of the evacuated, they are still affected in containers for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. this is about construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="599">The local picture journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, who quickly spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures, the vision of the police detect the police, identified with a stroke attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás experienced a wave of political power: here, the activist of a Whatsapp group was murdered in secondary schools, and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policemen who has been attacked by a policemen who struck him with a stroke stock.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police intact</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only State in Brazil, in which it came to brutal police officers against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen were used in the Rio de Janeiro's protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had a stage for speakers, rubber arms and trace.</seg>
<seg id="617">The deputy Flavio Serafini, social and peacekeeping Party (PSOL), bat the police on violence against demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo preferred a title story with a fire on the fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausiible journalistic reason, over a broken window weight than across the protests of thousands of people who serve as defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This is to recognise if you strive against any form of atomic damage.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Law of Álvaro Reynoso studs almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the middle of Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">In fact, the Volksde Gregorio Arleé Mañali, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no notable sugarable sugar.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were produced in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After reaching the sugar cane, the sugar cane in the region still lost, and the factory lost and after its facilities, until only the frame of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to be found.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and pendors every day to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo database veteran, which is open every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis is smoked in the sugar cane industry.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are in the east of the sugar cane factories, which have been returned into operation after a long time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something, what he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds right that in Mañalich will receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resistive the plagues, the case of socialism, low market prices, the inefficiency, bad administration and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 amount.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been some decades ago for the country, but the poor harvest were no reversity.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban Zuckercane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old train stiff was already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The contamination of the sugar cane industry was a economic need: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">Motives, which led to such measures were the small productivity of the sugar cane and the refuge in the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nonetheless, the sugar rate rose before approximately one decade.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report "agricultural exports" from the OECD and FAO, the economic and food organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production has reached the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw sugar-export amounts to roughly 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all worked fine</seg>
<seg id="652">Today's day, the Cuban President Fidel Castro declared the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">Since then the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the standstill consisted of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full moon for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same thing in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañali on May 14th, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as it is known as a soldier, is talking about the closure of the factory, the word that he is repeated on most repeated, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost any respondents have the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first attempted year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially collected in order to be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed by the address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could be addressed every disclosure.</seg>
<seg id="663">Since there was the responsibility of responsibility and letters were still more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of two years for the set of the factory, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money, insured in operation."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for the retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will at the standstill of the factory, whose construction he helped him.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part, he removed his dismantled one of his 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work environment was deleted.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the labour and services that were generated in the communities in which they were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if the Mammut speech of 21 October 2002, then the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw that he was guaranteed for the regions of their factories, whose factories have not been in operation for five years.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the referendum of Gregorio Arleé Mañali learned that many things will change, but not always to better if a factory will be closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better, when they started, they also heard it, they also heard the road to asphalted, this disadvantage also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were given to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without future inspections, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production is not even for the supply of the assembly.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media about the infamous struggle against the drug trade "in Mexico the miseries and killed just regularly in statistics. however, this spironing is not against the extent of the human tragedy that fight against this fight.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on Drogenbosses as El Chapo Guzmán, the boss of Sinaloa-Kartells, pushed the stories of conflict in the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, someone hardly anyone who have learnt to the grapes, or to the municipalities that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every body, behind every bone appearing in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories paying parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican telecast portal Animal Político is created the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trade,"), that a voice should give a voice, and stories of people tell the fight between the prosecution of the authorities and cartella.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">We didn't join us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug traffers and entire municipalities therefore need many kilometres, to buy some such as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "vidas que cambian por el miedo" (german: "how fear life changed") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who is looking for every weekend of secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost their father in only one day, her four sisters, her husband and two their nephew lost.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare for us today to the task that we have put us to go and to graves after people who loved us."</seg>

<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th, he should again be back, but he never returned. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me, because I am now with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, which is here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but which gets not paid them out because that a dying certificate will be missed.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprating a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't need to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we need to show the international community the conflict, the ceremonies and government leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on Stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader from Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, the Federal State of Guerrero in Central almexiko.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form them:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have now know illness and sensational journalists now for some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come every day to newspaper ckiosken and see the title pages with pictures that are actually only from a textbook for criminology or rejects of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling, as if I am the only, or sad. it works, as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to the body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be equal or as normal as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin will think that he is great. and it is not normal to hear people songs about the "helmets" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me is that, when they would have lost to those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if Stories to naked numbers in one statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The crime unemployment of people is unbelievably for me when the death of six people and the disappearances were justified by 43 students in a neighbour suburb that they were afraid. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think it attempts to talk to them that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of pressing in the main city area: like a family with threats," it describes how Armed the Month for the month money from their business presets, until it was not only destroyed the business, but also her family had torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think all that you lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain is never stopped, the trauma remains, the fear will come back, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">Each further we are removed from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed its report with words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested, because you don't know how to kill you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked me in this terrible days, if I would like to solve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten about how to live. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the generation called generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he casts questions about how: who cares for a child's wife and a man who was murdered by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it, in a settlement at the outskirts of the most dangerous cities Mexican?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like the other boys of his age, whose parents will take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells that he had to kill himself as a egg, potatoes, tortillas, tortillas and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine folds on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boys for the whole life of violence and had to learn to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, told him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had already past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father saw that of armed men had been shot by armed men.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by the organized crimes and battle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous cities in the world by the number of moratorium according to the data of the office of public security and government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Prosecutor's Office 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and moved into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Just a few stories live in view of the new headlines. this project reminds us to those who have not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprila Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to set more complex information behind the drug trade that has shown the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" from Flickr-users Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: this article and the pages, to which he may contain pictures, which is shown on violence.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment, in which it goes to lift a rumor or a fake to escape.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something has changed the first time? content in social media, matter whether true or untrue, inclined to stand further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been used since its first release, tragedies to illustrated, which actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of picture and event - "false Description" or "false context" in the Terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - deny not the fact that it gives abundant coverage on events in the DR of Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it throws questions to our review to news on our desire to the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank wagon passed the place called Sange in the East of the DR of Congo, reversed and exploded. there came 230 men's life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa, South Africa was neglected and devastated. the streets in the region have become too dangerous paths of impact holes that were difficult to beeing.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragisation fell victim to the victims of the tankers.</seg>
<seg id="828">It was described a fire-ball, the dutzing houses including a cinemas, including a cinemas, who was full of people who looked for the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burnt and wired bodies in the streets are scattered.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to infinity.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, January 12 2015.Multiple photos of the precaution form the grey scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">The top is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of low body, which are spread over the ground during the people.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story will not find her end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same picture was taken several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but they are not attributed to the connection of the tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What, and what do not in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="837">On January 3, 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the entleaded Nigerian Ortisan Ortler and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye diseases reported drastically did to flee from which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down in roads and bones.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="841">The numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count Leigh to count," said a population to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were choked, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite images, the follow-up was depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the working point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt by Boko Haram to win country (examples from the year 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here's the picture from the DR Congo again, when it accidentally presented as a proof of the fact that the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacres of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, these abbreed use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of false activities; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image has been brought back as a voucher for measures.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring to personal comments such as this example, the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, by the United Nations, those who were able to flee, raping and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported by the Violence against the Rohingya, Posts wrote the following items such as the following descriptions of the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, which claimed that in 2012, the president Myanmars Than reigned, monks and politicians have been involved in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the image from DR Congo to illustrated this information.</seg>

<seg id="860">Tracks of these false tracks are enough to return back to 2011 and 2012, and actually come across all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "umdecent image search," you can see how far more information limits can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A modified image search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 images below 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017) 344 pictures found that the discussed picture from DR Congo is very similar.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed mask, private pages, platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have reported false reports, some have attempted to dislarvae the forgeries.</seg>

<seg id="913">When the picture later, in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to resist the newspaper El Pais tried to raise the connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorfertilyaUyuy" (Nigeria branded the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo is provided with this Twitterhashtag, on and extinguishing a discussion under Muslims after the Boko Haram 2015 and the stop to Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their events took this events that took place in the name of the Islams, a larger attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image has been recorded as a cover for the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 by the massacre of Boko Haram 2015. but the messages that were linked together were not attacked in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Chinese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After an embassy that allegedly had been written by a "Father Juan Carlos Pascal" over the Nigerian massacre, in circulation, the discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and explain it to the wrong announcement.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy, in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo, the organisation of the Claretiner missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Pascal Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are more confirmed examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">On other users, aggregators and pages in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey) shows Tineye, but are no longer retraceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the Webcrawler and dismissed them about image file in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared quite clearly after the original accident of 2010, the image may possibly be correct but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two severe themes or frames (one floods), which passes by the posts. the first frame focuses on Religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in the context of Christians by Muslims, or to the defense of Muslims - the killing of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is subject to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is however, what happens if reading these pictures can't give no longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are threescore people who have unintended to realize the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugarys this mood of false and falsely information that actual fact is untrue and tastes the real horror of what actually happened in the DR of Congo in Nigeria, and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of the spread images has already been debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that it comes back from images of a turnable to detect the tragedy. the pictures even requires from the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time the concern that certain images readers and viewers desensizing and selecting the ability to receive empathy (such as this study enacted, such as violent media, to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some distinctive representations in the news media, fact is fact that it is essential for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting, because with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." they are thoroughly thinking about the situation, in which a picture is somewhat suggar, which actually can be used in the context or entirely abbreed type.</seg>
<seg id="940">A study of false supplements should be considered to be considered internationally as an internationally.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photographs by Andy Simmons used to use CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name imtranslatable (i.e. uncovered), language enthusiastic portrays a selection of words from all over the world, which is difficult or not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words there are in any language: you press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these untranslated words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others that are deeply liced in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sosloesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist hard on any attempt to a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not sufficient to understand why a full explanation, and sometimes a little context is required to understand what a word is meant.</seg>
<seg id="949">This unique words have been collected for a full time in a online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists at Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and Linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog one finds words out of Mwotlap language from Vanuatu, as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Get you by your parents in recognition of them how to make yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik Language, spoken in parts of Brazil, like:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or sloth, which feels, after being cast off at cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In bird words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They entails other cultures, unveil other thankings and wake our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, as we influence the world to analyze ourselves and classify the linguist on this page even more of these "untranslated" words, show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages.</seg>
<seg id="958">Redner of the "Treasure Languages," which are very appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload your favourite here.</seg>

<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practiced our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify us to be a Muslim but different kind. but somehow we put all in the same Muslim sheds.</seg>

<seg id="1026">This Narrativ overshadeth the reality that led to the nine Muslim women in the last three decades, while the USA will not operate their first female presidency in the last three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This Narrative schemes to recognise that if French, Muslim women are forced to bear their head in public buildings and Saudi Arabian women, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, that these both are both sides of the same medal.</seg>

<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the explanation of stories in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported a short initiative called Steven Bird, the Importable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the voice variety of major cities and would be worthy.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban regions, such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or Oakland in the United States, where TLS had already been carried out since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not given to the children of children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The project is valid for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided, if we make cities that diversität, safe spaces, in which it must not forget to hear them.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listen often, it is often associated to understand this events instead" the listeners to feel to feel, link. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, Counters will initially set their history in their own language and translating or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants have no professional history counter, their devotion and its representation is that the audiences are to put on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions out, than be the language not longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which will be told in the language Dafing. during this round the coatings enchanting in Rassidatou is also the opportunity to explain the country of typical customs of creams.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the Fabel of Hasen and Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he asked the importance of his fabel, John Nyamusara will be asked: "how is that to speak to an audience, that your language does not understand?" with a wide Grinsen he divides his feeling of inklusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentively...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organisers hope to extend this. all those who are inspired by the project, can organize TLS in contact with TLS in order to organize their own history.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambikans reacted to a corruption in case of a governmental member after half of his prison sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus, was committed to the corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is about Diodino Cambaza, who arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other accused were sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other accused.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public Geldern from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council stood at the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good guidance and required his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement of the Prosecutor of the Republic, the request of the Republic, there is no obstacle for Cambaza, due to its old postage, since the company had no disciplinary method after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants does not know the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, shortly CIP), a local instance, committed to public transparency, sentenced to a interview with Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to set up the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a withdrawal in the fight against corruption and illustrates the absence of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our strategy, such a CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we can take to knowledge that the company would have a disciplinary procedure against the contradication.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was apparent, however, proves no reasonable steps for the use of the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambulance of social media, rejects this behaviour as well as "resistible":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza a competent guy would be, he was sentenced to imprisonment after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating retain, he could advise and his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But because he is inkompetent, he has entered into the company to be reintegrated in the company which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is apparent: Cambaza is to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradically!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambikers and student of politics in Brazil, the director told no mural:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he could inseive him that one would be rewarded with such a way that someone has already rewarded me.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the Moral to return and to serve the state, * he had already used a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only himself served on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as handy to become an inexhaustible money source and the state itself is tired, the preloaded, and finally was sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1278">One of his most famous imaginations were, when he was energetic, that "an ambitious man should be able to sell also the paternity in its ambulance, his own individual interest, for sale."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but it does not change of his counterparts.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocked the rapid word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to injustice</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burmese word "Kalar pae" means Kichererbse or spage.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to the Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their postal network out of the network because it was the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or general as adjective "Indian".</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook presents the word "Kalar" or arronized (in burmesial Scripture) as part of an initiative to set the widespread problem of the Hassle in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascension has given radical nationalist movements to the Word.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly of Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hatred in Myanmar, the company dedicated a lot of senselely content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'just like to be associated with racism, but the word is calling out to call hatches automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important and # 8212; many people have reported that Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, or doubts to the use of the word, have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burmese words with a fundamental meanings that have the same accounting sequence such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is also written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spalter), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myate declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends on spiritual kind, whether they could destroy them as he could play his back pain.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "healing" (ku) + the fragranort (la) on Burmese - similar to the racial expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hun is the opinion that she is Hassle radical nationalists, however, stressed that Facebook analytical his mute, before all the Posts extinguishing, which occurs in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It felt the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you can write on Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What instead of instead, the mail should be carefully analyze and check him by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spalter).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that this dreadly nationalists, the hate speech will receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action can send a strong signal to all sending, the hate language may not keep the efficiency of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat should have proven that the Zenorship often is often an cat and mouse game, with the user social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative writing of the scenic word to press their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myate described as Facebook began to delete his position when he wanted to share his friends when he allied to his friends, that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentively attentively to this new Directive of Facebook, I made a post to make my Facebook friends, that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironmaster, my post from Facebook is removed and me, the liken, posting and parts of intimate for 24 hours, because the post "will not say the post" Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posters from people who have no negative outlook, or the simply trying to show their opinions towards the hatred radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that its post was removed, nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassler's speech.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious foundations are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook has supposed to do more than the start of the initiative, for example the burmese internet community ask:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a wealthy intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">These words will only take more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems, as if they start this without local context or technical support, they have banned words such as "chair" or "Erbsencurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even as they found it, they didn't have made mistake, they tried to prove the random postage.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If you have a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that have a large turnover, would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has donated for a lot of donors under the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of it serious, users can now take over Facebook fun and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassle to see if their posters will be taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook post, which have no hate language, but still removes:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With homologation used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The burmese text is "I want to eat and look at a chair and look at a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out, whether Facebook contains the post, which contains the Word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, with homologation.</seg>
<seg id="1334">Next post "When you are a doctor, do you heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with homologation.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious foundations, social networks are used to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among others, Hassle is to convince the violence into the municipalities in Myanmar in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine Area, especially in the territory of Rakhine, where disputes are forced to escape thousands of Muslims and Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been working for his failure to bring out arcerations to his burmese sides under control, critical.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than just hit the word 'Kalar', it would have been better ongoing in context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN child prevention, the minors of the age of 18, defined every man under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15 were already married, in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the national central office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which grew up, laws about the children, followed at the feet and freed large support. doubtedly, they followed this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, it was not smoothly smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, e.g. had no concerns to say the critics of children's children to say they should be damned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind religious opposition asked for voltages in this actually uncomplicated cause, and sometime in doubt if the opposition would agree to the bill in the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill against children's before decided to be decided in spite of 4 Senators (among them one wife) of the opposition and an independent, which he could be discussed under the Representatives of Representatives, where he would already make a simple majority to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country's vote and the law proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators found on Facebook a status update, Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against children before she was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 voices, and nobody decided on it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">When he had decided before the Senate, the study now be decided to be the law.</seg>

<seg id="1376">Before months, Maharaj Maharaj announced his intention, judicial steps should be adopted, and he seems to be the promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a Verfeeder of the Law, said it is right through lawful if Maharaj would like to preserve the law, most social media users, one would need the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Brrell smote:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, when we would like to keep the debate in general, in a way that only panic and unmwood could cause it, that it may be used by large, hard fleet, that they may be used in the advantage, if you would be ready to pass the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if it comes to a judicial ancestor against the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there is still places on the world where the children's before in different gradations legal or continue to rule the norm, though it returns to them.</seg>

<seg id="1393">For over one month, Turkey enters the popular and on the crowd sourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for Tag is clear how important the platform for users is to find useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV series are against the plywood.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technicians are lived for blocked websites (a current article by the New York Times stated that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users are not in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been closed since 2008 by Wikipedia, as recently as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, has been held regular blockers of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the world's most famous country in the world when it goes around the massive censorship Wikipedia by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, several Mirrorpages are now updated (pages that are on the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer computers), which is not difficult on the system of domain name, thus makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogmail reported to IPFS about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (on the number of Wikipedia), we put everything that on snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so, the opportunity to read the content on decentralized and shared manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step is performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it was just around screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to walk sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consuni by Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiknopedi.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as VikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can utiliated any Mirrorpages if in the respective country Wikipedia is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consunny reported Rohashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as employees at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Score "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is no complete copy of a proxy address, an Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Hitting on another URL, which is not the original. that what you see, is by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server leads to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the content from Wikipedia itself, if this is locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it better give to a passionate game photography!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested in at home when suddenly Navaraj (the Manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) had called a call of my father, that at the bank of the Rapti river a Leopard would be a Leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist location Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">I go immediately with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had seen him and showed me the place on the other side, where the Leopard was found, and I immediately began to tripsen pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar dispute a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepals Nature and would like to destroy understanding that wild animals are not so fine, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood tigerm from the presence of face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger could not be astonished by the mind of sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>

<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for funding from Nepals nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was posted by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala, and was originally published on Video Volunteers, a award-winning international community organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published as part of an Content-Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women do not avoid the greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a Pronuns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chosen sph to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, give women to respect the husband to respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should abuse the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted out of the Indian state Odisha by a family-court in Odisha by her family and the village community, after she had an married transformation with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition also did not call their wives also at the name, also under men it is also common. however, it is far from less assignments if not at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them healthcare and house frauen, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main constituent of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they discuss the enemy of patriarchate and discuss it.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is run by the community Video Volunteers, and is used for the installation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of interns, such as child heirate to the network of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and runs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and made them simultaneously to embassadors at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in its discussions round showed, handled by women who did not call their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She was chosen for this topic, because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands did not speak according to the name of their husbands, a Brauch, which they keep all sunlight, and never have put them in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini mills:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition has testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes to give him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">One woman who doesn't hold this is considered a deceity, as woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deep that we have never made us up to this discussion round thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="1488">In the beginning, Rohini, who had never been called her husband until now had never been called by name, as it runs at home.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the discussion of her husband and her mother-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband is still long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me, and said, I must call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in luggage, Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">Following the video projection, the women tried to bring the debate with a exercise in speed.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any participant in the name of her husband with different feeling - happy, offended, sad, lovingly, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it be equal to this? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women shall never speak the names of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so notorious that it was just before the whole exercise in front of the whole exercise; another decided to dispose the whole frustration against him and his family, having cursed it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression of their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think it will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in Adrenalinrausch about, with an ancient Brauch, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a wife called Rohini and asked what ideas used to the women in his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another clerical member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she was afraid, she was afraid, saying that it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less obvious and the situation in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women tries to stop other practices, as for example, as the tear of the cinogenous red point on the forehead which shows the husband:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the cinematic red point when it was also open.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard it to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women are not complete with that, but my, they be now in a better position to pick him up on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip to every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually, we packed lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make women make sure what could hear, "says it."</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays in their own birth days with cake; they danced and talking about things that they had never thought earlier than they had never thought.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working here for so many years since so many years I have been working on some things, for example, like our identity of our husbands, still never honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great, certain things according to say, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have connected us on the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been carried out in the group since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, the right is okay, but some wanted to bear a salesta curta, a wide shirt over a pants, they have not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After many strife and discussion about the excerpts of your own clothes, the Moral is associated with Saris and much more, Carugged Rohini its own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">As next, they decided now to plan a trip to Goa, when they can carry jeans and Rohini is sure that they can create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months have already changed something changed since the first discussion club has been modified, Rohini announced that the things have slowly come into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women proven a few times, but then they returned to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, included me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are present.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Just one or two say the names of their husbands, one or two women are now able to bear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes that they would like to reach their lives - like the Feilies of more freedom of movement or their own clothing - at the end of a difficult navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By adding mutually self-trust, they will be aware of them that they will sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club there is everyone of us that will change anything.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman is home in the club and other people reported that we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We sit all in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The respondents of the video Volunteers Community come from outbound groups in India and make videos on stories about that is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be stupm, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be viewed as a city as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State Association of the State of New York, the Minister that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He understands that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has put in question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, whereby most people go to a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">Blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to defend the logic of logic, to defend the existing authoritarian statement of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and orders to create this valuable land, you will say that we will finally be no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the certificate of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory bid.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons of Shanmugam were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to what man could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what he was unidentified undisputed.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore can be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, same cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the Thames, again the good old lyre from the autonomous Machbern is to leave the promises, abandoned logic, because they fit better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week of Shanmugam, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests concerning our press, our judicative, our political system really not answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant questions, he completes Non-Reprational Art.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng Requires Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion, as they did not agree with this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is no country, but a city, so to what land is part of the city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our commercial K Shanmugam would assume the point to clarify this point where he became very paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By calling on his comment posted on the blog, he shows that you should begin to read the entire cooperation of the conference, that you could understand the context of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said, Singapore was rather a "city" to be a country, "declared that the elections in Singapore is so unintentionally important, even if we are free and justified elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He enched Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore "was no country," he did not make it manifest in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, who is as leader of a Herangrowing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I'm talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which is expected to be understood with them, or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not once sure whether he really is associated, really associated and deliberately what he is defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review divided the sponge points of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr Shanmugam "committed an error," or was it a Freudscher Verger?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we are only considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equal to the country and town.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role in the government cabins, the statements by the Lord Shanmugam of serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the discovery of Singapore to defend her military service, defend her country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Where the Journal of a Decade's Journal about the years of service, Singapore is, and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have many people more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever spoken that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often say such as "the defence of the country above all" etc. "but this is not quite right.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak to the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1742">The question that is put in Japan on most, is: "you are Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, do I speak to me, and answer me." I come from Canada. "since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "nice" is called to be called, is in fact, as the fearful, gentle, but trageous figure Ned Flanders from "Die Simpsons" (which has an own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the actual problem is that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There is no corners and edges, nothing that can be cast out.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, is unobvious and desirable to earn any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, from the dingen that happen around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go, to say that the desire is free, and alone to be one main part of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to care of our own matters.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What to sign as "nice," it is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI.org, published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited this place in the Mexican town Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year old Mexican, a small woman with a corals pink frame and gold colored earrings in teddy Bear.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was raised in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This pointed name is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Afrikaner and Haitians, which are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with grounded, floors and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of african and haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, tell Mrs. Ramírez, the people come into full-bushes and from the upper part of the coast. "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently there is more quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">You want to reject it.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them to hospital when they are sick, they buys them drugs, they will not pay for them to pay them with a balm who exhausted the long journey from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama is a reasonable first name for Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghuru) pointing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"Yes, yes," answers he with a smile. "I really feel that it is too her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping for Boston to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, however, it is for several Africans, who are on the way to the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then go towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had belonged to the family of Mama. "mom Africa is a well-known name on the route," Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and the Afrikaner often travel along the track together and that the Africans already speak in Whatsapp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his way, Michelet lived in Brazil and worked as a builders on construction of the Olympic Games and the Football World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest's guest at Mama Africa: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bucket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have in the future with Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," answers he smiled. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells that their guests have often send text messages when she continued to grind them or report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that your Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Don't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought them to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only sparkling hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The other end of the city leads to Jesús Valenzuela in the other end of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family lived in her small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and found that the stickers have been sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them to help them a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for one dollar a night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they experience." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the wilderness, and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to have money from him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked to a accommodation, and a well-known, a well-known, her roof is offered to him.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Some months later, the family lives still and tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the course we ultimately consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus today arrived and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but it is nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she did his album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hairy, who made her a clientity, some photos of their grandchildren and many travellers, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">They laughing sad, while they were shortly before.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fuone," repeat them every time. "they have already gone."</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication units in Xinjang of Twitter users, intervated by Twitter</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware for their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phone users received a mobile phone notation in Tianshan District of Urumqi, to install a surveillance-app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the notification, it is said that the app "access to terrorist information is to access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kònes the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous ili Kazakh Prefecture because it was shortly after they had installed the app, messages with a private white chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the release of the police that the app sources and the distribution paths of terrorist actions, and pursues, together with "Illegal religious" activities and "adverse information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojanern and phishing pages to make users to make sure that, how much time they spend your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these features can be used in diverse way.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hacker is able to steamed the home network of one person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction stands in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">During the messages of digital Zenorship in China mostly focused on the experience of users in the East and south, the reality is very often dying for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to rest unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often have extreme tensions and monitoring measures, as well as routinely Internet cuts.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter Basque Media Outlet "images from Mainland China" (invented by a Checkpoint, published pictures from a Checkpoint, at the policemen who installed the residents of either passport, if they had already installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian is sure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you have been discovered in Checkpoint using a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a return for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use the people who are intended for older people, to use.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity in capturing technology.</seg>

<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the City Council, to minimize the spread of Illegal Into.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities, and associated with party facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office at the operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>

<seg id="1990">The intention is apparent somehow to identify and destroy the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives you penalties for a whole range of other possible quotations, including such that focuses on peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2092">The picture was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib brings more to the most of its time; times he turns into his screen, once to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What can you leave, it is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicoty lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house since 1967; in which Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family looked to be forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Since more than six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, who underwent to the conservative majority of GILECHTERROLLING, sexuality and free expression of expression and rapesity.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often replaced with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian ploughed, but he also will find out the core of the entire Arab world. all these subjects will not only find out in cities such as Damascus, Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib could not be restricted to the boundaries of his thinking, and he can communicate with men under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it wasn't open to us, he enjoys a special upgrade against the US American Foreign Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considered his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believes not that his co-feeling for those who are trying to do with his identity as "Palestinian geance of the second generation" - so he himself called himself when he was born in Jordan, and has never been living in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life cycle so," betont Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he added: "I think so, because I have dissolved a man, while in water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law proves that public consumption of food while Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib apparently has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senal hot Junitag did not do little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In general, the gap of luwarmer coffee and the swades of Kent cigars are in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in free skies, especially when you throws a look inside the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore we avoids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to walk not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Ministry of Jordan has canceled a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary election organised by the Islamic Act - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argumented that sexual orientation of homosexual frontsarers Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country is irresisted and the main reason for the concert table.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputy and former press spokesperson in the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "had been cancelled," because of the sexual orientation of the Sangers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, who gives the old legitimacy authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement Mashrou 'Leila the Jordanian people as "progressive destruction of human rights," which still decided to use "for an intellectuals and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be seized Rhetorics, but actually a clear-out reality in Jordan contradically contradicts, which occurs in Hdaibs plant.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib, traditional gender chterness to gluttled his vision by the fate of arabic women, who have sex to have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously low-known wife, whose arms and legs were astonished up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, in Jordan, the number of the 'Honour morde' has increased the inset outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch according to its climax. however, the number of Honour in 2016 reached its peak; however, Jordan was still missing, Jordan's institutional infrastructure is missing, to support women, victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the breach control from the year 1954, women who are subject to the risk of familiar violence, "and for her release is often a longlanger bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee side of the family is necessary that the woman will happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music is very pleased with great popularity and is not known for themes, in his country long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib was that his work is politically, however, however, that he can separate his music that is full of explicitly appearances on sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">He was talking about me, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib took the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" is the focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically politically, can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse was repeated, often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everybody is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind market, on which you can get in his words, "that can I want," be it faith or non-believe, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that there is hardly any one in Jordan on the rights of gay and readers and that comments on the balance of LGBT + -Individuals still have to be censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya to prove that his comments made from the context, turns and his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a revised version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib was open to the ArabLGBT + -community and resignation the opinion that intolerance of homosexuals do not say to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poets of the eighth century, which still has remained today thanks to his homogenerotic poems in memory.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat was working on behalf of the Kalifen, in the eighth century, you could open about homosexuality, why can Jordanian not this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The actual problem, so hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian Kingdom there is nothing more new that the government must be debated on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service took several former government representatives and members of the teachers, they would have been critical to the comments in social media-critical to the problems with the deep in the land surprising corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of its, the Hdaibs concert that is only the top of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to have a structural change in the next generation of Jordanian.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Mashrou'Leila has now progress for him in a row, but the way of progress - so that there is Hdaib - consists of slow, reasonably and interior changes. it is sure that this changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib was ultimately called hdaib, such as million Arabs also, of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreamed to bring his work up to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the area using music, art and literature of a real and basic openness, and not by bombs, Streumunitions and artificial art came down democracies. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is far as far, Hdaib is far more distorted and therefore also resistors.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was called by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, to the Aman as Student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">We suspected that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which was also celebrated in August in many opardous Tohokus, and from a period of time, in the armies from the West Japan, to settle the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi near the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could sleep a couple of great seats, therefore we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, designed a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (littl).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I'm looking back to the Meguro Gajoen again: two fixed car is just to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only truths - and still a breathtaking kind and way to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also copy the unusual hairstyle of famous sportsors such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led that more standardized hands of hairdressers in the experienced hands of hairdressers can be found.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The exceptional demand for hairdressers who go to the outer boundaries of the fantasy and creativity, even an annual event inspired by the hairdressing "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the post "love messages to guerrilla fighters," which has released the international online magazine Tea after Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why write we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel themselves out?</seg>
<seg id="2185">It is exactly this question the two young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga by the Young-Youth Foundation is no longer from the head and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people to encouraged letters to write guerrillas letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, the country of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after many years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with guerrillas (german: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the longest of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International is the subject of peace agreement as an important that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the column, however, a long way to talk to a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakras, who were living for many years in Illegal camps, had been exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock of their weapons in order to integrate their weapons in life than civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In turn, the Colombian company again decided to reconciled to life in constant war and in some cases of deep hatred with guerrillas and must support them in their rows and support them in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and cristian were convinced that the young columbians have to join and would have to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And just that they did also: until now, thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages to former guerrillas in order to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one of every former guerrillas - which will be delivered to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there were Leonardo and cristian who had the opportunity to talk short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who love him to write thousands of love letters, but those who forget it necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, told him, in this year his love with men to share the most urispy additives.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So out of the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC to write their place in society, and is preparing a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a joint history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is located in all major cities of Columbus, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that somebody would never be forgiven.</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the City Administration of Cali and Leonardo by the Foundation Bogotart moved to the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC as they had done before they had done before the commands of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters full of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all participating. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be carried out in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between, told the politician student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this memorable experience such as:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former officer led me through the bearing of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut, in which the guerrillas workers were living), I saw a guerrillas who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had to be afraid, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Granatwerfer ', a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I said, "Hello, what do they do?" he said, "I answer to a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It's a very nice and hopeful cover.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone has never written something so nice, and answer me. "because my tears suddenly ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I raised him completely and set me in addition to the pomegrower.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Maybe he was the war of leid, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions, and wanted to write this letter to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from the life than war. the FARC was the only possibility to keep him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought that somebody would never be forgiven me for my faults.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society with open arms that waits for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned just as I have to go with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now there is peace, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For opening there came students and some leader of the FARC to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised as early as the war and the FARC already existed in the hidden.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the Peace nation. now, where we have the opportunity to develop us to create a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this order, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people have never heard that yet had never heard that yet had never heard and do not know that people who have seen often as monster and even horted people, even people with beautiful tidings, who were surrounded by their lives and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the land lives, do me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it trusted me that all people - even those who have killed, and so much damage may have to put us anything, and can give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have delivered to letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The colourers was made, that after developing peace would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take their weapons, to take care of their rights. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We use the FARC on peace, on a politics without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call any defense of peace on - no matter of any race, religion, or ideology, listen to all those who dreams from a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word to make our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from my own experience, that nothing is simple to defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are coming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat, which depends on the Damage group on the dorm LGBT community, is not first formed over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who has dealt some of their experience with us, which has happened in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">LGBT Q-legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international impact on several months after several months, having published the towing, torture and killing queens men in the Republic of thematised.</seg>

<seg id="2249">"they brought a Monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Already since her childhood, she felt that she was in reality a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they were grown, she became aware that Chechnya was no safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Tschechens from the gender equality of their land, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">From anxiety around her life she moved to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helpers in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help you, when I thought it would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere in the internet, with the following message: "then there is no men over Chechnya that can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the pictures taken from my documents by Whatsapp the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing, a couple of shopping mented by the back of my cars, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned back, I felt something in my body, but I did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on shorn: "how long will you honour the family nor honour, you scandry?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the awareness and awakened last Endes in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started writing.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was flown.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Women had a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I drove that I had two results in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nursing wings were placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name; but the doctor fell down and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got to do with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful to him that he has respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They cried out, I wrote me - relatives, stranger, some perfect unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of an Alpine trauma.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was attended by neighbours and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The demanded that I returned to Chechnya in order to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They introduced absurde claims: some told me that I would prove them above without through the streets; others wanted to say that I had not changed in the official television in Grosny, that I had not changed my sex, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have Körbchensize C - what would I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family tries to change this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people talked about my mother at the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They brought a monster to the world, that is not only your family, but the entire republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you, because you are a good woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much, and she lay hold a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and delivered them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and just a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened window discs and a number sign with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it was, I was clear that there was something faul.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights approached the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I will not give their names, but I will say that I have remembered them all, they have really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still realize, how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it to register without me, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came in and checked at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered for a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I have the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I asked my mother by Whatsapp I got a message: "you don't believe in safety, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already, in which hotel you know. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: stand with your family in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, on the gender equality, we didn't talk, that is a Tabuthema.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still live in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very I wish I wish to overcome this seelical barrier, I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say always that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to destroy them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we outfit with camera, I give me much effort to see how the person reminds out of their past, so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: know something about the present location in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who remained diting?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington on last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who won one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that Ramadan was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait for a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focused on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So, I invite you to download the relatives to those who takes care of the problem with the affected person and at the end, the so-called "honor" caused by blood genugtuation.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even swule men in these secretions?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says, there are not many of them.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, in particular, those who have no rich relatives or those of their relatives have been added to Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so they can present it later than terror.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be brought to show her body in television and claim that they would have any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if this man did not simply have disappeared, but targeted to radialize them.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a mutation or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I cited just someone who was inadorned one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people disappeared in this prison, after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And so the so-called Lord, this person was taken away, when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they have not been presented as bandits, in addition there were no reports. we guess that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise, we could not allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and discoverings of people who heard a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always contributed my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I guess already before 2003 I was already known in the whole Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia I had never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In Russia, Russia wanted to bring us to "civilization," ultimately finally rejected us at the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were poured; I had dyed eyelids, made tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the Scharia has never curved to me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, mainly on weekends, a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches arose, and the whole town knew why they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a reproduction: Kharda ma Kharda, that is, "Spotte don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often say often to children, if that are fun with sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just locked up their eyes before you, because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: Yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me never beaten and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this passionate time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, to Kadyrow on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 he began to speak on TV via Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He said not to us by se, but for the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel as the people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had stacked in advance, and had seen you at a time with arguments.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the period I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I am working as a waist.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not have much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Of it, I still have been active as active activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I've been responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize Teetreffs, meeting, I join them to hospital and helping them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a penny.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people when I flucursed impressed.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I'm Muslims and wants to help those help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hitschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albers.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that is pure, nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to make you with foam before the mouth that there is no swings on them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have the Cabot, which have Russians also have; on the planet it gives them - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men out of the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practiced Muslims who go into the mosque and during Ramadan fasting - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many think about Transidentity of men who love husbands, and they believe that they changes his sex to make more intime experiences. but this is a tear.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of receiving, to be exact, different habitat.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not, whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry, I'm sorry here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad, because I know that I am now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warns an increase of self-morality within the devastated Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers under an unusual high unemployment and armament within the native Arab population.</seg>

<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the combustion were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>

<seg id="2410">Arabian Ahazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is part of a large living in Iran living in Iran of Ahazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">Before a century, the Arab Ahwaz was an mainly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi-Monarchy took power over power and 1925 great effort to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran last oil and gas fields as well as some of the richest and most valuable working areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy is continuing only slowly, and the local population receives only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victim of untreated diseases, hunger and disruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Irish regime denied the Ahazi Arabs systematically jobs in local oil, gas- and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of demons, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian regions where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are.</seg>

<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become even worse. reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz to come from an upcoming ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since the functional and institutions, there is no Arab worker force, the local Arabian Ahwazi will have access to work possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the regimes, which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resisters of young Arabs and deserve them to earn their habitat outside of her home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their first- and descendants to hide their affiliation to the Ahazi to hide and so that even Arabian name will not be tolerated, because the speaking Arab language or tragen Arab clothing.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with the feminism, even with the intersectionals not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of comments made by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was subject to several discussions, in which many different positions were exchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not feminist, many women - especially white women who record themselves as an intersectional Feministic feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put a well-thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money and earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">However, women still are still under strict observation, if it's why they are to make her body with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women purchased earlier or later in various areas of life on a glittering ceiling, and that discrimination against sex is still passing through many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware, and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I'm convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come on skin colors, on racism, on black transidente women, to black women in the LGBTIQ-congregation or on black women from Diaspora; if I have been abused, both in and outside of feminist movement, many white Feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, however, all women think that women should come together to raise "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing, to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexual violence, a institutional form persistently motivated violence, which we subjected to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethics and hermitigation are less deserve than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls with a migration of migrant workers are proven to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed in black sphere and women with a migration of a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">In one side, I want to have all men, all men, and all of all men in any skin color; on the other hand, I can join me as a black woman, which is refused to consider unprofitability in their thinking, which refer to gender as well on the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and become no more about my refuge in a white feminist-oriented animosity against me and countless black women always turned down again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner accused of his speech: "I am not a woman?" and I also refuse me to obtain a ideology in which the black woman is a simple and marginal being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse me to connect my group, which is also absorbed by cultural applications and customs, to preserve their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try anymore, white women the importance of transforms of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to try the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to consume a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional Feminism was founded in order to give women in a home of different approach to get out of white Feminism, and is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I go before, me full and fully tightened out of the Feminism, which was called for my dark skin and mine status as woman, instead of mine for a white feminist paradigm, that is so tough, that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women after our own ideas and give us into the spinach that we will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the Book of Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves to our own type. and not only that - black women can rely on this way, in which they can rely on our own type and even the spiritual elements can be reverent to make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional Feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, please inform about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the blackwoman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognised as a woman as a part of this paradigmas due to my daren skin.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can blossom in a field, in which my life is neither supervised, nor yet to be rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentary of Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his congregation.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river which we lost, when I was a child," told Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from the whole country, that the decades of the war, the construction of reservoir, pollution, and uncontrolled development, lead to the immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "Die wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" from Kurdish. the article is one of the series # PorSerMujer (# tenicheinefraubin) who reports about women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protection of the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police Commissioner said Ada Bávez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their partner, who had become a member of their work.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship was passed, and the police said, her statement would be laid for the acts, but could not do more.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena was used because of Misuse, there is nothing useful display by Ada Bávez.</seg>
<seg id="2485">Some days later, the second wife moved its display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Teufellowship of Violence against Women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women are refuted at all once again, they will not receive support with regard to the Staats.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, the women also depends on the men that they misuse them. this explains why only 20% of all women who will be admit, victims of violence at all in the prosecution of the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content and Statistics 2 Invisible abuse and an legal system that has nothing undernourished 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, mantle implementation beats and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It's hard to describe how many women really abuse, says Myrian González, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different data and reports that are not even ansatories to show the extent of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">But those available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Office of 9600 ads placed on domestic violence. at 70% it went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads placed by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence in peace. also 86% of the ads placed by women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements they said 40% of women that they were physically misused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, this statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayischen women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these offences are actually shown. "on every woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">Each woman, which is refunded because of physical misuse, two women who do not do, "declared her end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since Gynexation in Paraguay, there is no own offenders, the prosecution authorities cannot be documented, how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Alone until August 2016 journalists killed at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered in their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to its estimates, in Paraguay, all ten days a woman died due to violence in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible Misuse and an legal system that does not take anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the fixed girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that they called his name for all of their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">But at the beginning she didn't want it, but then, after that, she should always return to them.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. but two years, she contributed the psychological violence against women, and the most common forms of violence against women, and simultaneously the most deadly recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I've never thought that I would have been victim to Misuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I read earlier this, I thought that the only woman happens to be lower, because they are affected by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the Misuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions to Facebook, in which they described its reward and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he was isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, among them also Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever received the hand against them, and refused to agree that his behavior was also a form of misuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users questioned Mariana, why they had fallen so long from Carlos, and didn't leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost so, as wanted to say that victims of misuse were at least a certain mitence.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which comes from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partners miss her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo ("I believe you") which consists of women that are all in any way victims of Misuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk about their experiences, listen to each other and support mutually.</seg>
<seg id="2519">You do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias Case started everything with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partners finally managed to convince them that they were valuable.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads placed on the authorities without score and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against their former partner who developed into an immenvious legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country, where it went mainly by money, power, and influence their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, mantle implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very well but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The display of Misuse is a way of withdrawal and a fight against corruption in the justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, looks great problems with the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill in the Paraguayan Parliament was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Fürstink).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-InWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter, which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original study of the law looks to explain Femizid in an independent criminal offences and harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2532">The legislative text was changed in some points to win the MPs for the law, that feared the way for discriminating of abortions, which are prohibited in Paraguay, and will be punished by up to five years imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, shown in picture with his understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is not mentioned in the media only rarely or not mentioned. there are a growing area that adore one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need of medical research there are two reasons: for a lack of health care, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more grained impact than elseo, and lack of investments in research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a great problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists itself is carried out in Africa. a bigger role of science and technology can only be instrumental in the economic growth of the continuity only.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for Research of infectious disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s at Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic of the first severe impacts on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a student in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the university of Pennsylvania, he himself spent on HIV-virus before he decided to go back home to support the sambische healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed over the future of medical research in Zambia and over misunderstanding of media about these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sambische national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just rigid a research program for developing molecular tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion based on your opinion in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research. we are only solutions to have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That must change, otherwise we will always stay the recipient instead of myself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often not used in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where is the financing and assistance?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult it's to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are encouraged different.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who will come back or come here, for financing and development of development in other countries are better.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries. it costs plenty of money to have continuous supplies with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how does the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are to be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the Potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are demand on special scientific training, starting at every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of world-confidence, health care (non-transferable and growing diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are very beneficial.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the distinctive access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals are only accessible to payment (the so-called "Payment"), limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: as "Open Source" plant producers to change worldwide food production.</seg>
<seg id="2628">This entry of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about the solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred already since the 1980s in the USA Salad.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties such as outreddish, the first plant, built by NASA astronauts in space and has been used.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years of work was Mortgated work only by his own income and the question how many salads may get it, boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he knew that more salads were patented and that he could not use them for further to bred.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last years, more of such patents have been registered for more plants, such as cereal or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeding and experts for food security concerns the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still needs salad, he needs longer, since its work is still more restrictions on more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is when I lie in a river, in order to lie down.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to make this now, but it is a fraction with the tradition that says. "I think that these patents go to salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they withstand before the dish, no one can be able to bred more a new salads because all features are already patented. "he makes it so good as possible, trying to cover those characteristics that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and manned to use no material that is being protected as a spiritual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It also has a motion, which is always larger in the USA and throughout the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" trains).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS have bred red Römersalad of the Sorte Outreddish in the "Greenhouse" of the station. it will be tested if plants can be built in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It's no coincidence that this name might sound so sound, as the movement would come from the IT sector, and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" Saatgut) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, alternatives to urably protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called to life in order to ensure that some plant species and has not been protected as spiritual ownership and so for planter permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, OSSI called OSSI, US-Breeders may agree that other things can be bred free from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not do that they do not want to do with her seed and do it. "open source" breeders allow you to cross their seed, it's not to breach their own varieties - two aspects that prohibited by many vegetable patents or.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Düstere prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emergence Professor of Wisconsin Madison and OSSI-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed-good and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Saatgood plays an role in larger projects such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the nutritional system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to use the latter, or just little while using seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stressed that the "Open Source" movement did not work with intelligent plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables, grain, gentlemically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "if you want to buy any more frequently encountered vegetables in the global agricultural industry, we should know that the species is offered to the markets, should also know that the way is bred to themselves, like this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary sovereignty without seed solidity is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative is obligations to provide other seeds down to their seed. thus, its predecessor in contrast, seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi subcontractor arguments that the future of food supplies may endangered, since the Suit is available due to abundant intellectual property rights due to the always paid intellectual property rights, which is always limited to limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Faculty of OSSI, has resulted in their doctoral thesis with genetical variation with carrots and their availability. she found that about one-third of all cartons is protected as a spiritual property, making it not only use for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, these estimates are not yet, but experts like Luby avoided that massacres of the vegetable plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants become so bred that they are targeted features - of such that their taste or their colour has improved until these, due to those of which they keep in certain environments, such as pests and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on vegetable properties indicates that the available plant material for breeder over more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary as ever before, as the changed terms are foreseedingly due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email-to-speaking Monsanto-Sprecherin Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. having a total of four genases and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of the United States set up the company for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">They contradicted, however, that intellectual property other breeder, as "Patents and the Protection of Plant varies by innovations." "a patent was taken in the basically a plan which can follow once the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions will help others, with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such more protection inhibits innovations not, but promotes the public more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent loop, do not have any innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have been waiting for a long time to breed plants, they have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, would have been lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument of Morton is that genetic resources always been a general well-generous, and it also should remain: "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetables are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate its work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what makes us drives and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Altogether, Morton is distorted to the concept of themselves, plant features: "we created the characteristics not really itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them out and as breeder we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and OSSI-board member, there is also another important aspect of the plant breeding: "who cultivates a variety, also bred his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in the industrial agriculture with large courtesy and monocultures, for their cultivation masses herbital needs to be bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium businesses (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject the patents or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">In his breeding gardens, Frank Morton looks back to Salad's breeding gardens.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that Breaking through the avoiding of vegetable patents would be innovative: "it looks like that I would have to produce new efforts to produce new effort, more powerful than the company.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors are to sell my varieties in a few years himself, "says he." with a patent for 20 years before competition, wherewith it is just fine to my opinion, "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Though the United States seem to be leading to the "Open Source" breeding, the concept spread out quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Development") describes himself as a professional organization in the area of resources, an "open-source" plant breeding program works the center with farmers and helps them to reduce new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports "Open Source" Saatgood to come and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization warcol works on an "open source" license which ultimately represents a formal and legal form of OSSI-commitment to breeder in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for the breeches differ from land to land, due to the OSSI obligation not just one in one in Europe or other parts of the world can be taken.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive committee of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventional plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents to the conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a explanation is still no law; now it is on the governments of the Member States, to bring to this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference to "open source" plant breeding systems and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend to sponsoring seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Program for "Open Source" conference systems that the organization is currently expanding a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" Saatric systems, for the planned next year of the official launch of the official start.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, international non-profit development organization USC Canada, and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a saatgut map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global Alliance for the Future of Food, the McKnight Foundation and other - a report published that country confusion must have to come on seed and improve the saathabitat, thus a stable supply of food safety can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report also the importance of a varied, local supply with seeds good for sustainable food systems emphasises - a connection, by the Luby von OSSI hopes that soon it will be detect more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has notified especially on it, and how slightly attained, and saathabsystems have hardly any role played, so Luby." we are now trying to declare the human being even more behind their food. "</seg>

<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columned.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend about the 05.August, the Egyptian government adopted the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents the human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and the selblast reports.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, which criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step-sharp criticised the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information stay in spite of this attack and the Constitution by the authorities, defend the law and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never so important like now.

<seg id="2735">The blogs is very old but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi, but even if the locking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to prove me the feeling of a siege to determine; an arrest, a tempted murder, preloading of the national Security Council, the plunge blogs and any other web site that I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I didn't have anything else. in other words, my words have an impact if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used to go to the post of articles, to go to the zenship.</seg>

<seg id="2741">The Much move the way to the end.</seg>

<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we felt like the plitudes of websites that we offer VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">A such practice indicates the intention of government, continue to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will be deteriorated by means that the censity deciding behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, resulting in front of judgment against this actions.</seg>

<seg id="2888">A few years he worked in a cohanger. the work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took this, which was left out of his low rate, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towing bags with mortars who were heavier than he himself to earn his life.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, life Afghan refugees in Iran was minted by Elend and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="2892">There was no other services and no heating. we hanged nylon before the open window, that we should not be refreshed. "</seg>
