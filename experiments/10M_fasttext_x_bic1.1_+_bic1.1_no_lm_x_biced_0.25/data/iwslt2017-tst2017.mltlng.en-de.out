this is James R@@ isen .
they may know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Pri@@ c for the New York Times .
long before each one had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen has written a book , in which he was spectacular , that the N@@ SA is illegal phones by Americans .
but it &apos;s another chapter , that should leave a remaining impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic @-@ secret service operation , which gave the CIA liter@@ ally det@@ ention for an atom@@ ic bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but you know who doesn &apos;t mean the chapter ?
the US government .
almost 10 years the government has been identified against R@@ isen and calls him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol for the patterns of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condem@@ n and journalists .
according to the First Constitutional , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and if they are not able to protect the mud , they will praise them .
so when the government was ank@@ ed in R@@ isen , he did something that he did so much to him : he refused , and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something exceptional .
suddenly , although they were aston@@ ished for years that it would be ind@@ isp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the financial assets of the government were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orter and sources can always be min@@ ished .
rather than to failure and cr@@ ises to say , these also could make his digital foot@@ wear for him .
and so , the investig@@ ators , without understanding , his phone , his phone ,
as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit balance , and even travel expenses with the list of his flights .
in the midst of these information , they found them to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke to his lawyer , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead , the justice time has more convic@@ ted than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how that &apos;s a problem , especially because the government can contri@@ bute to much of their work as a home .
since September 11 , almost every article about National Security was the result of that a hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist .
so , we put the press work on the game that will be protected by the first Constitutional Complaints , because the government always has more ways to try out all .
but just like the technology of the government allows the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can take up from the moment , in which they take contact , rather than in the desc@@ endants of the testimony .
today there is communication software that there was not yet been written when R@@ isen was written , and it is considerably safe than normal e @-@ ma@@ ils or telephone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source @-@ translation system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the capital of the Press Foundation , which has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of an e @-@ mail you will go to a news site , as described here the Washington Post .
there you can also instantly upload documents or information , as in every usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which have access to the respective news agency .
so , the government cannot be described more information , and many of the information that would like it would be no longer available .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the substances to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments at all over the world always new sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ et@@ technologies that are all end@@ ang@@ ered .
it &apos;s to ensure that this is not only technology @-@ flops such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to bring iniquity . it &apos;s the same thing that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
the more ab@@ out@@ ings of the supply of soldiers are white and of over@@ fill hosp@@ itals in the supply of soldiers . or the next environmental worker , the alarm to susp@@ ected water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider which war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies have not been made for those who want to cover the crimes , but to protect our fundamental rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data collection of history was released . &#93; &#91; what does this week have been hidden . &#93; &#91; what does it mean by Robert Palmer of Global wid@@ ness . &#93; this week , we were sent from messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s office firm Mos@@ sack Fonseca
the publication of these documents gives a small in@@ sight into the secret world of star@@ ters .
we will receive an impression of it how customers , banks and law@@ yers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fonseca go and say , &quot; okay , we need an anon@@ ymous company . can you build it ? &quot;
in fact , we actually see the e @-@ ma@@ ils , sharing news how the whole system works , how it works .
this has already led the first direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister returned .
there are reports that a ally of the brut@@ al Syrian Dic@@ t@@ ator B@@ ash@@ ar al @-@ Assad correspondence fir@@ ms in control o@@ ases .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children , a famous cel@@ lists .
well , there will be a lot of more people and others , the nerv@@ ous of the next release is waiting for the next release .
now , like the plot of a agent , or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ novel .
it appears to be removed from you , me , unusual people .
why should us read what ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mice are able to hide their assets in tax@@ o@@ ases , and not all their taxes , then it means less money for important public services such as health@@ care , education , roads .
and it concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ velation is phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading polit@@ icians , such as secret control o@@ ases of some few are used , their assets to hide and wor@@ shipped -- something that we discuss for ten years and cover them .
I think many people appears to do this whole world very conf@@ usion , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this star@@ ters work .
I always present it like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has an company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand that he is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult for pro@@ secution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is .
I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter .
probably because there were no promin@@ ent Americans that came in these re@@ velation to this sc@@ and@@ al .
well , it is not so that there is no rich Americans to hide her assets in star@@ ters .
but by the principle , after which this controller will work , mos@@ bag Fonseca less American customers .
we would have a data collection of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA .
indeed , it &apos;s so that in some US states must not need more information , please specify less information to set a company as to get a library .
this species of in@@ transpar@@ ency in the USA has allowed to zo@@ oming school children , school children .
it is subject to zo@@ oming , particularly appreci@@ ated an@@ xi@@ ety .
it is this kind of behavior , which affects us all .
here at Global wid@@ ness , we &apos;ll need to figure out what this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ators to the offices of 13 cultiv@@ ators in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as African ministers , to bring the susp@@ ects money to the US to buy a yacht , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked out that all the suggest@@ ions of our investig@@ ator suggest@@ ions , as he could transfer@@ ring his money .
these were all pre@@ domin@@ ations . None of these law@@ yers participated in clients , and of course it was handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it &apos;s also important to consider this not as a single cases .
it is not possible to spread a single an@@ w@@ alt , who managed to spread the suggest@@ s proposal .
it is not around a single peak of pol@@ itic , cre@@ ases into a sc@@ and@@ al .
it is therefore how the system works by cor@@ ruption , c@@ ursed , poverty and inst@@ ability .
to do this , we have to change the rules .
we must change the rules to create this type of behaviour .
this is all very warm sin@@ ks , as if we could do anything , but if nothing could have changed ever , than whether it is always the rich and M@@ ighty .
but as the owner , I see what I started to change one piece .
in the last few years we have seen lectures to more transpar@@ ency , representing the owners of companies .
the topic was found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then the EU has been recorded in central regist@@ ers on national level , who really stops behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the most important facts is that the US is left behind .
representatives of the parties have brought a bill in both par@@ li@@ aments , but this does not make the progress , we would like to see .
we would like to see how this Panama dis@@ closure , this huge in@@ sight into the world of star@@ ters , used as a means to ensure funds in the U.S. and global for more transpar@@ ency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who can see if they see how other people can hide their real identity after head@@ men .
we need a guide to ex@@ ecu@@ tives in the economy that rise and say , &quot; In@@ transpar@@ ency is not good for business . &quot;
we use the leading polit@@ icians which recognize the problem and end to end this type of in@@ transpar@@ ency .
together , we can complete the in@@ transpar@@ ency that is now able to finish this kind of tax c@@ ursed , cor@@ ruption and money supply , finally finish .
this is the story , as I was almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ grounds .
a guy in red Mazda was standing and looked back on .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and made straight a road@@ trip through whole country . there@@ after he would go to peace sc@@ or@@ ps .
I lu@@ d him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was ti@@ red .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; Where are you sleep today ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just did not know him ! he says he would go to the Peace of Peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t kid@@ n@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small car boot !
then I heard me , &quot; I have a Air Matt@@ ress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; H@@ as , how please ? &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I star@@ red at the blank@@ et and thought : &quot; Oh my husband ! what haven &apos;t I dried up ?
a wild liv@@ eth in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got a fear that I went out of the bed , on toe pe@@ aks on the door , and my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the art works that he had bought from me , hung up today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
that was my first experience as host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stran@@ ger , actually friends who were waiting for ?
people living on my Air Matt@@ ress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the Air Matt@@ ress .
we make a leap year , two years later ...
I am un@@ employed , almost ple@@ ases , my participation has pul@@ ling out and the rent will be increased .
I drove that it was time a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked out .
I think , Creativity can do it to convert an@@ xi@@ ety in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new cooperation Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I rec@@ essed such as we could earn something . our apartment will stay at an Designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded &quot; Air Matt@@ ress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the Air Matt@@ ress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ elet is completely different , because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we also administ@@ ered our last guest , and the door came into the castle , star@@ red Brian and myself .
had just discovered that we could find new friends and pay our hire at the same time ?
the things came into ro@@ les .
my former cooperation , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , ended us as a developer .
we wanted to figure if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented our investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms - the type rooms , whose doors is clos@@ es , when visiting .
then , on the internet , they can invite you to a strange person to stay with them .
this will the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the ro@@ cket would be .
but they did not .
no one that is still very near Tro@@ st , would invest in a business to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned as children , stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , you have to work on the things that can be good . we could be able .
at the art academ@@ y we learned that the design has much more than just appearance and h@@ ust@@ le -- it is the total experience .
we had learned how to create objects , but now we wanted by design imm@@ ort@@ less@@ ness , between people who had never met earlier .
can design such as something ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
I want to give you an KO@@ ST@@ PRO@@ BE , which degree trust we anst@@ ed .
it is a 30 @-@ second experim@@ ent . it is out of your combination zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone with your left seat .
this empty pl@@ ough of pan@@ ic , you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel the door when they open the door .
for the only thing that &apos;s more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can &apos;t just read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone in the hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they stay differ@@ ently .
for this reason , our company can exist .
just times so , who doesn &apos;t have Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could you see on Twitter , that he is di@@ pped to the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you some dis@@ cover@@ ies .
what would be if we have changed a small detail on this experim@@ ent ?
what if your neigh@@ bor had to be revealed once again with his name , if he tells , wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children promised ?
imagine that they would have 150 dep@@ artments that all say , &quot; It can really be very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then feel when you need to enter your mobile phone ?
because a good feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people , negative operations .
ulti@@ mat@@ ely we decided to wait for both host as well as guest their operations were published before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted Stan@@ ford a study carried out . we studied , as probably it is to trust one another , depending on how they are similar to age and residence .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly trust we trust the people most that are on the most common .
the more differences we find , the less trust we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ si@@ ege .
exciting , it is exciting when you added the call for a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ teilungen .
if you have less than three dep@@ artments , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good rep@@ utation of simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots in love .
in addition , we drove that confidence is dependent on how much you are in@@ expensive .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you &apos;re looking for too little , as for example , Hi ! , &quot; one gets no answer .
tells you much as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather assumed .
so , there is an optimal degree in op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; T@@ olle art works in your dw@@ elling place ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design , to produce this degree ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount text . we also give tips to which topics should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages compared to stran@@ gers .
where@@ with we didn &apos;t reck@@ oned , the great multitude of people who were more than ready to lay these ancest@@ ors .
here you see how many people will take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably good luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a demand that was not covered before .
the shop is very good for us .
of course there is also times , if not everything goes straight .
there were guests who celebrated celebrations in celebrations or apartments .
guests have been able to leave guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stood in front of the front when confidence is broken .
there is nothing of lim@@ mer@@ it than these calls . it is right now , if I just remember it .
the dis@@ appointment , which is heard in the voice of An@@ c@@ fer , and is always our biggest motiv@@ ation to improve us .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , the 123 million sur@@ vey@@ ed nights had only a problem .
because people confi@@ dential together one another .
if trust works , can be mir@@ rors .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him into the hospital .
he sp@@ ends up blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for passengers traveling with se@@ ated activities on heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hosp@@ itals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real protection level that save one &apos;s life though they don &apos;t know even properly .
you go one in your own car to hospital when you die , and wait for a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel at all , they bring books .
you can even stay longer , without extra charge , without extra charge .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to reach the Share economy .
when I was the term for the first time , I asked me :
how does the thought of section with money trans@@ forms together ?
this goes here to a economic trading .
but it just now &quot; rental industry &quot; to call it , will not be just@@ ified .
Share Economy describes a trade , talking about human relation@@ ships .
people put a part of themselves , and changes every thing .
if you are going to compare it with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what would however , if travelling have a rich buffet from local im@@ press ?
what would be if you want to visit a group there , a group there would fill a thorough@@ ly to fill a thorough@@ ly found and one at an Kn@@ ei@@ ving tour , of which one has never heard ;
or if you want to learn a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , they are designed in accordance with the principle of privacy .
what would be if we would like apartments of the reason to collabor@@ ating ?
how would this look like ?
what would happen if cities would accept the idea of the common part ?
I stayed in the cities that make us society and relation@@ ships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ pression .
in South Korea of Seoul , this project was already begun . many parking , belonged to the government ,
now living inhabitants are offered . students who were on searching for a lead ,
they were committed to people , whose children were moved . there were also incubation programs ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 785 000 people will be guest in 191 countries worldwide with a stran@@ ger or even host .
the idea seem to be so mad , as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work ?
apart from happ@@ iness and tim@@ ing we realized that you can find out the correct design of confidence .
design can help us to overcome deep parts .
I think it ,
right over@@ whel@@ ming .
I have to think about it if a red Mazda is gone on me .
we know of course that design is not able to solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I ask myself , what we can be coming soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you see me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed the bra@@ ins , a terror attack ?
or just a delay for security control at the airport .
this is true true .
I do not give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
so the media are the people , as I look like .
a study showed that 80 % of coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans know mine , most would have no Muslims .
probably the people did not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who never have never know a Muslims , it is great you know .
I say unto you that I am .
I &apos;m a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am resol@@ ved ,
a Furn@@ ace @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practi@@ cing , spiritual Muslims .
but not as Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to use me .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten .
no , not as hom@@ osex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my Head@@ piece .
my femin@@ ist friends were hor@@ rified : &quot; why did you teach you yourself ? &quot;
the l@@ ath@@ y was : at that time it was for me a femin@@ ist independence of independence , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and un@@ belie@@ vable beauty ideal .
I haven &apos;t just missed the faith of my parents .
I have the Kor@@ an extensions .
I read it , thought after , in question , dou@@ b@@ ted and believed ulti@@ mat@@ ely .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and s@@ ore dev@@ ot@@ ion , which is deep@@ ened with every reading of the cor@@ ans .
sometimes the beauty of rhyth@@ m brings me sometimes to the wake .
I know yourself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever get the feeling that som@@ eb@@ ody you perc@@ ei@@ ve fully , and yet some@@ how love ?
so it fe@@ els .
later I married and began , like all the good Egypti@@ ans , my career as engineers .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the findings of the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the aw@@ ful morning arrived in September 2001 .
many of you do not remember , where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had too late at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; rapid message . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flo@@ wn in buildings , people living in buildings .
what was that ?
a accident ?
a technical dis@@ order ?
my swe@@ ock related rapidly in in@@ dig@@ nation .
why should I do so ?
I switched the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; J@@ ih@@ ad ... &quot; ... &quot; ...
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country . but in the N@@ u related me the de@@ eds from another of a civil war in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to travel through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as we drove me -- as low as we went into my seat , and I was afraid of the first time when Muslims can be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment in our apartment , in a new city where it was like a completely different world .
and then , I heard and read the war@@ nings of the National Islamic organizations that discuss : &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; be careful in well lit up , &quot; &quot; assem@@ bling you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then there was fri@@ day in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered for the bed .
and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; go not on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw my extensive coverage .
the fe@@ el@@ ings were un@@ inten@@ tionally un@@ filtered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who stayed for Muslims , held free and sm@@ ote for Muslims .
there was really burning gri@@ ps on mos@@ ques .
I said : we should stay at home .
but something felt really felt .
because people who had attacked this country , our country was attacked .
I depos@@ ited the people of people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was aw@@ esome .
it is not easy to explain to yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the exc@@ use , which are hard .
nowadays we can hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims and Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the United States .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or Gut@@ arti@@ g ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a mar@@ in@@ arian tum@@ our , one keeps only under observation .
the altern@@ atives are sen@@ sel@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , such as all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first hel@@ pers and the Olympics .
will the closure of Mos@@ que America secured ?
it will not keep a few parking lot , but not the terror stop .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to view the other faith toler@@ ant , and larger civil participation .
and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , D.C. recently told : people will not be radi@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they will be radi@@ alised in their cellar , or in bed in front of a computer .
when the release of the radio process has found that it is online . as the first one will be able to do the extrem@@ ly group , that the person may believe , the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior , and their ide@@ ology , is a betra@@ yed or of faith .
if we want to prevent Radi@@ k@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group just@@ ified like the IS their breeding ality with the Kor@@ an .
as Muslims , as a mother , I believe that we must do anything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would put us into their lecture world if you have recognised as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christian@@ ity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but when you th@@ rows a look at them , they do not drives what they are in their &quot; Holy Scri@@ pture . &quot;
it is their breeding ality that they can read these things into writing .
an extraordinary I@@ mam t@@ elling me recently an amazing history :
a girl came to him , because it had regard to the IS .
I was really sur@@ prised and asked him if they have been in contact with radi@@ cal religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each intel@@ lec@@ tual , with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence , and said that their wrath kin@@ dled the sense in the world , they would only bring trouble in trouble .
nothing inspired by anything that their mind has been given , she was an main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ isation of extrem@@ ists who had a solution .
this I@@ mam set the connection to God and their congregation .
rather than to acc@@ use her W@@ ut , he showed her construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que , preserved them before the IS .
this was an in@@ sight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it work on each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy , foc@@ using on our thought freedom ?
a study - actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ entist studies -- show : if we fear , we will happen at least three things .
we accept an aut@@ onomous government system , con@@ formity and supplies .
a study shows : if one reports test@@ if@@ ications messages , in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they also agree to a military attack on Muslim countries , as well as the incl@@ usion of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mo@@ ods against Muslims after Muslims left -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorism .
it was in the court of the war in Iraq and two election periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to mos@@ lem terror , as I have expected it .
it is actually a tool to the public man@@ ip@@ ulation to the public , to ex@@ its the foundation of a free society , sen@@ sible and well informed citizen .
the dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel as first but the po@@ ison@@ ous air of fear fell to us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , it is not only to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , tal@@ ented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , great man , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her life . she was hop@@ ed and said :
&quot; when is that of my bre@@ asts have become a versi@@ fied young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Suz@@ anne , her brother and his wife , her husband , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , who was murdered in the afternoon . he did it in their apartment , as in the execution , after he had posted to Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be un@@ mor@@ al , but also f@@ atal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we walked to the mos@@ que , or remained safe working at home ?
we discuss it and for us it was no light decision , because it went to America that we would like to control our children : one that would control us through an@@ xi@@ ety , or one , in which we can cons@@ ult our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que for the mos@@ que .
we were silent with our son in the nurs@@ ing seat , with high pressure at the mos@@ que .
I took him out , and went out my shoes , went into the prayer sh@@ alle , and what I looked , let me hold .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the I@@ mam made an announcement , thank you and called our guests , because half of the gathered Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who were come , not for us to attack us , but for us .
at this moment I have broken .
these people were there because they had cour@@ age and co @-@ feeling pan@@ ic and ancest@@ ors .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from fear and the Fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you go to number safe ?
or will you close to those who are my : we are better than that .
thank you .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to hit a ner@@ ve .
but I ask myself what do you say that you can claim a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mem@@ orial with dr@@ au@@ ght that are working in a noble monument factory , so there is no exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t have . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually have so much as it is allowed .
if you can look at Muslims of the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study of Muslims come across the world , people want human things .
they want to be well @-@ known for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any respect .
if people appear as an exception , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what a platform for Bast@@ ler began , just before that , a milli@@ meter business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is possible in research instit@@ utes worldwide .
before air par@@ cel dis@@ missed in our social awar@@ eness , an aut@@ onomous fleet of flight machines in the fra@@ c Centre in France live in front of a six metre high tower of 1 500 goat . some years ago she started to fly with rop@@ es .
due to a connecting flight machines , high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build up sel@@ dom able structures .
you have lear@@ nt to bear l@@ ute to re@@ act with tur@@ bul@@ ence and general on nature .
today , we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the rem@@ over in the aut@@ onomous flight .
thus , a system of aut@@ onomous works , it must know collective compl@@ aints , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the E@@ TH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s dem@@ os , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laborat@@ ories .
there is no external cameras .
each flying machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are of the highest Eben@@ e . e.g. &quot; &quot; and &quot; lan@@ den . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called Heck@@ starter ,
one flight unit , that tries to beat two flying fl@@ ap with a fl@@ ap .
like other Star@@ r@@ g@@ gl@@ ers it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most high @-@ vol@@ atile glasses , it can be floating , and has a lot of great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eper .
a limitation of tail@@ or is that they re@@ act sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ences such as wind bo@@ ar@@ ches .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea is behind that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter the optimal position , and the performance can be improved by practi@@ cing .
okay .
during our research , we often provide basic abstr@@ act questions about the core of the cause .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as the machines with a thousand mobile parts that are merg@@ ed to viol@@ ate you .
decades ago , pilots trained pilots remote @-@ controlled flight machines , which had only two moving parts : a propeller and a tail@@ ru@@ der .
we discovered that flying with just one working .
that is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically del@@ ight@@ ful re@@ mot@@ ier . it was invented in front of short .
it only has a moving part , a propeller ,
no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse , no further actuator or control areas , just a propeller .
although mechan@@ ically simple , it &apos;s very much to fly in the inner life , so it can fly stable , and can move in space .
nevertheless , it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear light . to bring it to the flies , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood , it &apos;s right to throw , if all to see me is small , so Show me a video that was filmed in yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ dar@@ ity , this machine is here , the Omni@@ fe@@ eder with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ers , an exercise in excess of flow .
what to do with all this flow ?
they see that he was not sym@@ metric .
therefore he is ambi@@ val@@ ent in its align@@ ment .
in this way , he receives the most au@@ lic@@ able sk@@ ill ,
in the room to move in all directions , no matter what he is turned , or even as he rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight parts .
one piece is able to be able in models directly with the flies .
let us see that .
if flying machines once become part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ propeller machines .
this is clock@@ wise in clock@@ wise
and the others against clock@@ wise .
if you re@@ build them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- a engine or propeller is falling down , electronics or a battery - can continue flying the machine if also restricted .
we will demonstrate that we are going to make a half flight .
the last demonstration was analys@@ ed synthetic vibration .
the great number of aut@@ onomous , coordin@@ ated units enables a pal@@ let of aest@@ hetic expression .
we took a common micro Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit it with loc@@ alis@@ ation@@ ships and algorith@@ ms .
each unit is white , where she is ir@@ regul@@ ated and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstr@@ ations to think new revolutionary ideas .
on Broadway , the particularly safe machine , you want to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course it &apos;s hard to be predic@@ ting the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wages in development and the skin act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and en@@ chan@@ ting our universe is , and that it allows creative , rich fl@@ aming , they have to form so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology sol@@ dered mas@@ si@@ ves and economical potential , is the scar@@ fs on the i .
thank you .
in a very long dist@@ ant galax@@ y , two black holes in a very wide dist@@ ant galax@@ y , two black holes are always faster , they turned into the mass of three Sun@@ es in a tenth of pure energy in pure energy .
this short moment , she ligh@@ tened her bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big boy .
but their energy , they were not free in the form of light -
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time po@@ em itself and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ elles .
we first notice at first time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , a combined life was created on the earth .
since then the earth has brought forth : cor@@ als , f@@ ishes , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand up with -- even the internet .
approximately 25 years ago , a group of Mu@@ ch -- R@@ ai White and Ronald Dre@@ ver decided to build a giant laser detector to build a giant laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational health , which are caused by Colom@@ bian black holes .
most held it for crazy .
but enough people know it as a mad gen@@ ius , so that the US National Science Foundation contributed their idea .
according to the decade of decade , design , conc@@ eption and extremely har@@ der work they built the Detector LI@@ GO : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ric Ob@@ serv@@ atory Ob@@ serv@@ atory .
in the following time , precision of LI@@ GO could significantly improved considerably , which improved the detection capacity enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly .
therefore it is called Advanced LI@@ GO now .
at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO has started a last test run around some smaller , hard problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commission@@ ing of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ are of the two col@@ li@@ aments of black holes through the ground .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : two mom@@ ents in my life were emot@@ ional than these :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well from my to@@ d@@ ill father .
in the bas@@ ically , the fruits of my life was the fruits of my life .
all that , what I had worked , is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colle@@ ague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ als from black holes since 23 years . what are Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ als ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation time is a c@@ abling of space and time .
at the front of the shaft , the space and its total content will be extended into one direction , and the other st@@ olen .
to illustr@@ ate lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for the relev@@ ance theory , often have a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stret@@ ching and dust , stret@@ ching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ are extremely weak , even smile .
on 14 September , for example , everybody was extended with us at the meeting of the waves and st@@ olen . el@@ ong@@ ation of an average people were 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st half , one explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that &apos;s already ab@@ sur@@ d , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a nuclear core . that is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic report about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt after the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties of such det@@ ectors are r@@ ape .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are er@@ otic and with the support of the public , all obst@@ acles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
Back to LI@@ GO . Scott claimed , LI@@ GO be more than one eye .
I would like to explain what means .
visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than the things around us : face , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite practi@@ cally . for example , you can make a picture or a map of d@@ ingen , by using the multiple points of the light around you .
sounds are different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it &apos;s very hard , actually impossible to produce a picture of D@@ ingen , which mean you especially much :
the face of your child .
instead , we wait for certain properties like audio and height , rhyth@@ m and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; born Bob . &quot;
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ elles .
we can &apos;t make any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by looking forward to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can listen to all liter@@ ally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to lau@@ rel , can reach us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes that my colle@@ ague Scott are already very long employed .
SH : two black , not turned holes , pen : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies are very fast , he@@ ars the same cir@@ cles with an additional sound change . it sounds like : WU @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a type of movement , shaped into the wave shape .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that I will never forget -- heard LI@@ GO following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ der noise &#93; J@@ enny , who knows how to hear this when the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 f@@ iller compound , which move around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : superior to us , what does that mean .
two black holes , the thick@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 Sun , the other with a mass of 36 Sun , revol@@ ve a hundred times a second before they were col@@ li@@ de .
imagine that forces before .
fantastic .
and we know it , because we have heard it .
this is the lasting meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO eb@@ net a beautiful new way to explore the universe , as they never had previously made possible .
on this way we can hear the All and the invisible .
much in all , we can see -- practi@@ cally or in bas@@ ically -- not see .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why we explo@@ de stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about that .
the exciting physical prec@@ au@@ tions could happen in the core , which lies behind thousands kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see you , since this op@@ ak are .
Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ elles passes iron , as it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ kn@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe . but we will never see it , since the ur@@ b@@ ite is covered by his own ob@@ serv@@ ations .
thanks to Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ ellen , it should be possible until the beginning of the beginning .
and that &apos;s most important : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we never have never seen , and of whom we never have never seen . things we can only explore .
in fact , LI@@ GO was right in the first run of Things we didn &apos;t expect .
my colle@@ ague on the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , the black holes , are the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to speak the sau@@ erk@@ raut for our arch@@ e@@ ological work .
LI@@ GO allows us a completely different viewing angle on the events in the All , to the emer@@ gence of the stars and ulti@@ mat@@ ely as we went out of this ch@@ aos .
AA : the challenge is now to be so far as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to get great det@@ ectors and the noise and cir@@ cles of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories -- a very new generation of ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in all .
for what might be more beautiful than the Ur@@ kn@@ all itself too lau@@ gh ?
now is the time big dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you .
some time I tast@@ ed a experim@@ ent .
one year I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; to say that I was afraid .
regardless of whether it made me nerv@@ ous , me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be live in television ?
no , but yes !
do I want to play with the Schau@@ play ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly that , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , elim@@ inated my fear .
my fear that keep my social an@@ xi@@ ety -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; Yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; Yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life , on an un@@ expected art . it began with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son , and Emer@@ son , the youngest ones , calls for un@@ explained reasons . &quot;
it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need to use milk for my Schn@@ abel@@ t@@ asse . &quot;
she asked me when I could play with her , when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life of living in my family . from there I &apos;m thinking about to play with them when you can do with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m sorry .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children to our family .
but it also has a devast@@ ating side effect : only recently , I didn &apos;t understand that the &quot; Yes &quot; S@@ ages to play with my children &apos;s career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think about things , bring to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing television , in great style .
for this TV season , I &apos;m responsible for the world to add 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
any of the ship@@ ment offers hundreds jobs that existed before .
the budget for a TV epis@@ ode can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
another epis@@ ode all nine days of four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows that simultaneously are in production , times four , 16 episodes : sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run in succ@@ ession on Thursday night .
on all over the world , my series will run in 256 languages for 30 million vie@@ wers .
my brain is globally , and 45 these 70 TV @-@ hours are broadcast , which I have created itself , and not only produced , so still o@@ ben@@ a . I must find time , really st@@ ille , creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fi@@ res that burn around the world .
do you know who makes it yet ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author does . &quot;
I say to you all of you that are so hard working , whether you say a company , a land or a household , that I do not only am the computer , and it is true when I say : I understand that there is a dream job of dream .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no te@@ ars .
I have been working much , hard and I love it .
if I &apos;m deep@@ ened to work in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work will always be a land from nothing .
it is , when I set troops on a screen , I found on a screen .
as a dream man a high tone , loving a marathon .
it fe@@ els like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that of the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , challeng@@ ing and ex@@ emp@@ tive , funny and dis@@ rup@@ tive , clin@@ ically and m@@ omm@@ y , cru@@ el and sen@@ sible . and the best of it is the Sum@@ men .
there is so a change in me if the work is good .
a s@@ ums starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the Sum@@ men he@@ ars like a bel@@ lion road , I could always go for ever .
many people assume , when I call them the s@@ men that I speak about writing to me .
do not understand me wrong , it does .
but the Sum@@ men -- when I started working with the television production , when I started to work and to work , to create and work together , I discovered this matter what energy . the Sum@@ men !
the Sum@@ men is more than the writing .
the Sum@@ men is action and activity . the Sum@@ men is a drug .
the Sum@@ men is music . the Sum@@ men is light and air .
the Sum@@ men is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a s@@ ums , then you can &apos;t leave differ@@ ently than to size .
the feeling , not unlike size to disp@@ ute , regardless of the price .
this is called the Sum@@ men .
or perhaps there is also a workout olic .
perhaps this is Gen@@ ie .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is fear of pre@@ m@@ eit@@ s .
I don &apos;t know it .
I know only that I am not for the failure , and I know only that I love the Sum@@ men .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it in question .
in order to be clear : the more successful I will , ever more broad@@ casts , the more work , the more work , the more , the more time , the more watch me , the more can I write history , so more expectations are there .
the more I work , to be successful , the more needs to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men .
I like this s@@ ums . I love the Sum@@ men .
I need the Sum@@ men . I am the Sum@@ men .
am I only do this l@@ men ?
and then stops the s@@ ums .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ st@@ ressed , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the Sum@@ men stops .
now my three daughters have been re@@ conc@@ iled to the truth that their m@@ um is a single worker .
Har@@ per tell people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estimate , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Land . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ ic .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the Sum@@ men were ceased .
the Sum@@ men of Motors did store .
I don &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the Sum@@ men did not return .
my Sum@@ men was broken .
I made the same things like always : the same Titan@@ ic work , 15 hours @-@ day , conv@@ inc@@ ing weekends , no reproduction , don &apos;t keep nothing , with a whole heart , clear eyes , whatever is always .
but there was no s@@ ums .
in me there was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview of Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the Sum@@ men and the Sum@@ men I was .
so what if you do , what you do , who loves work , d@@ ying out suddenly ?
I know , some may remember : &quot; hypo@@ cr@@ ite you , Bl@@ ö@@ der writer @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know , you do it works , one man do , one teacher , a pain@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the Sum@@ men stops when the Sum@@ men stops when the Sum@@ men stops , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
is I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart hear , I can sur@@ vive in silence ?
and then I &apos;ll make my &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; a question .
I am on the way to outside , late inside and she says , &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
and I will say no , as to me two things :
first , I must say Yes to speak and second , she called me not &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when is that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m looking at Titan am and my Sum@@ men , and here all changes my own eyes .
and so they say , &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; Yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and her sisters , we lau@@ gh much and I read out very dram@@ atically from the book &quot; ever@@ ed po@@ ets . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the Sum@@ men@@ s , I can do nothing but not to miss out .
I focused on .
I am silent .
the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they exist no more .
all that exists if you &apos;re stick@@ y fing@@ ers and dam@@ sel k@@ iss@@ es , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and song , in which it &apos;s Los@@ ses , or whatever is the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simp@@ licity .
the air at this place is so almost that I can hardly be bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I bre@@ athe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is dissolved .
a mental door goes on and an energy recovery is coming .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the Sum@@ men come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly ever , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the Sum@@ men , but a s@@ ums .
and now I feel that I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s let us stay on the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it &apos;s something that we have forgotten .
the Sum@@ men , the working environment , the Titan@@ ic , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you , if I say to you , who am I , if I have been managing the aid of ship@@ ments and television lessons , and how working my brain , then I for@@ got what the real bu@@ zz is .
the Sum@@ men is no strength and it is un@@ employed .
it is dependent on joy .
the real Sum@@ men is dependent on love .
the Sum@@ men is the river which comes from the vit@@ ae .
the real Sum@@ men is self @-@ consci@@ ous and peace .
the real s@@ ums are ig@@ no@@ red the pressure of history , which contri@@ bute to inher@@ ent tasks , expect@@ ation and print .
the real Sum@@ men is simple and originally .
the real bu@@ ck@@ ness is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe even whis@@ per@@ ed God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , a lot more love .
once my child will play with me , I will say Yes .
I usually make sure that I can open me as a work@@ outs of any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the Sum@@ men .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I like it not .
play me not ans@@ ing , as we work .
the truth does ,
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I always have been working , because I love it .
I am better in the workplace as da@@ heim .
this conc@@ ession is pain@@ ful , because what a man is working rather than to be home ?
well , I am .
let me hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxing , is none of it .
we quickly around in the garden , before and back , and her .
we make small Dance @-@ Par@@ ties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we split bub@@ ble bub@@ bles .
I feel the mainly st@@ iff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always leave to my phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the Sum@@ men of the universe ful@@ f@@ ills me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we do with the games ?
they can also say . they always say Yes , if your child would like to play with you .
perhaps you keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a dre@@ aming .
there you have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child takes you less interesting , than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes with me , until they make something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , take a Mari@@ enk@@ er or bis@@ cuit .
and my teen@@ agers speaks whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , no need not need .
each can bring 15 minutes on the piece , even at a bad @-@ La@@ une day !
15 minutes on each !
no phone , no wash , no support .
the day is short : d@@ inners , the children were ready ready .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
my children are my well @-@ felt , my world . there must not be the children . it is to feel the Sum@@ men to feel a place for his mind in peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with his own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
take the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out there and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m coming and I wins . friends meeting you read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is just for everything that I had given my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more .
15 minutes on each , why not full 15 minutes away ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the Sum@@ men came back in my leisure time . the Sum@@ men seem to return , if I do not work .
work does not work with games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door , the energy flow , and I find me in my office . I hear me about new ideas . the Sum@@ men under@@ went back to new ideas . I use it in full bre@@ ed and love my work again .
I like the Sum@@ men , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men is not I ... no more .
mix and stick@@ y finger , dinner with friends .
that is now my Sum@@ men .
the Sum@@ men of life .
the Sum@@ men of love .
the Sum@@ men of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so dan@@ ce@@ able .
it is s@@ cour@@ age to me that I am a Titan . I never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I still have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my storage fire burn still burning .
the more I play , the happy are I and my children .
the more I play , the more fe@@ el@@ ings I feel good .
the more I play , the more cle@@ ar@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the s@@ ums . the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the other , the Sum@@ men of life .
the more I feel the fe@@ el@@ ings , the more makes this unusual , be@@ ating naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this s@@ orts , the more I know that I am .
I am author . I think of me , I bring to life .
that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream man should be a bit dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I &apos;m neu@@ ro@@ surgery .
how most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how to change your life from one second on the other , after a heavy pun@@ ishment , or after an auto@@ incid@@ ent .
for us , neu@@ ro@@ surgery is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain is in contrast to other body organs , a very small ability to healing self @-@ healing .
after a serious viol@@ ation of the central nerv@@ ous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy dis@@ ability .
this is the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor , tries to improve the nerv@@ ous function by various surgical measures .
safe they have one of the most famous , the &quot; deep @-@ ir@@ n@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; in order to influence a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of ne@@ ur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ic function has improved .
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease , who suffered severe thre@@ aten and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we appro@@ aching us this dream .
I would like to demonstrate that we are very close .
with something help , the brain can help itself .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was chief captain and working day and night in the emergency stop .
often I treated patients with sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain rot@@ ates the brain and the sk@@ ull re@@ ten@@ ant .
to save the life , you need to reduce the p@@ inn@@ ess pressure .
for this purpose , you have to remove a part of the brain mass .
instead of the til@@ ene brain mass , we decided to analy@@ ze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analy@@ ze brain mass .
what I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
that is no easy task .
cells of a tissue increase , is comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families .
you need to find the correct food , temperature , humidity and the environments to let them go .
exactly that , we had to do with these cells .
after many attemp@@ ts to pursu@@ e Jean @-@ François .
this he looked under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as such as a cell@@ ular culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you can still know from the biology class that family cells are un@@ mature cells , which can trans@@ form themselves in any cell type of the organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has trunk cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small n@@ ical of the brain .
it is sur@@ prising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal cells are very active -- they are very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they turned slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like the cells , but it looked differ@@ ently .
we need to understand how to understand wh@@ ence they came .
they come from these cells .
this blue and red cells are hot c@@ ort@@ in positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ brain error .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the fet@@ us , they provide the folding of brain .
but why do they remain for us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that she participated in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain inju@@ ries .
but this is not so safe .
however , a thing is clear -- from these cells we received our family cells .
we are located before a potential cell source , the brain hal@@ ves .
this we had to prove .
so we decided to develop a experim@@ ent .
we wanted a piece of brain particles from the non @-@ known area and then the cells exactly as cul@@ turing , as it did Jean @-@ François
and they then mark@@ eted colored , to track them in the brain .
during the last step , we planted them at the acceptance of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous tran@@ spl@@ ant -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splant@@ ation .
one of our first questions were : what happens if we re@@ im@@ plant@@ able this cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ plant@@ able the same cells in business brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with the monkeys .
in the first scenario , we planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that they had been taken away after some weeks , they would have been taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so dis@@ appear .
in the second scenario , we added a viol@@ ation and im@@ plant@@ able exactly the same cells and now remained the cells as they were ne@@ ur@@ ne@@ yed ne@@ ur@@ ons .
here you can see what we were able to watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the proof that show them are these small points . these are the cells that we are in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
help these cells also to re@@ cover from a brain inj@@ ury ?
so we practice the monkeys with a manual transmission .
they had to take food pellets by a tablet .
they did very well .
when they had reached a stable level of stable level , we last used in the mot@@ orized Cor@@ tex the Hand@@ mot@@ ik area .
then the monkeys were par@@ alys@@ ed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are par@@ alys@@ ed and then try to re@@ cover with help plastic mechan@@ isms . you can pick up to a certain degree as well as the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey has reached the degrees of the spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left , they see the no wise , who turn off spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original output from inj@@ ury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
now , when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the tire plant@@ ation .
I can say you , that were also very exciting results .
since that time , we have found much more about this cells .
we can freeze them and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ pressing people in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the funds to he@@ al yourself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several do@@ zen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need . &quot;
I definitely go .
of course , the question , which are the greatest obst@@ acles before you can begin clinical trials on people .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obst@@ acles are the authorities . starting from this great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies .
BG : this is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate etc .
J@@ B : Yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and almost professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed the research and tested the permission to start of clinical studies . if you continue to see in the future , how many years it takes you to enter into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to start the authority to start soon ?
then , this study must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and evalu@@ ate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply to a multi@@ center study .
you first really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thanks for your visit to the TED and that you have told us .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we will make a great bug to consider it as of course .
we do not see the democracy of democracy , which is in reality , but the inventory of our society .
we t@@ end to consider it as an un@@ changeable value .
we believe that capit@@ alism was forced to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w from Singapore and his great after@@ mat@@ ters in Beijing have proven doubt that it is possible to have a flo@@ wering capit@@ alism and impressive growth , while the politics remains completely und@@ ec@@ olog@@ ically .
in fact , the democracy change in us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ miss@@ able to me as a financial minister in the euro group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- does not affect the savings programs , which were in Greece in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w or the Communist Party of China , or some of my appe@@ aring friends who would repeat me if the democracy would happen if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce a economical model for a real democracy .
I be@@ g you to believe together with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group could save an iri@@ descent , we could save us the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy .
since without democracy , our soci@@ eties are painted , our future dark and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the subject , I would like to consider an interesting ad@@ visory cont@@ radi@@ ction at present our host messages .
I call the &quot; Z@@ will@@ ings@@ Summit Summit par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known you . they know and know him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg that th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but only few know his tw@@ ill@@ ings .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which are conf@@ id@@ ent savings and concerts , which could be able to invest there , where it would produce productive and revenues , with which one might produce the debt , and also all the things could be ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; Energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months were invested in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars invested in all the well @-@ being produced goods , such as industrial installations , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , g@@ le@@ ise , equipment , and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollar so@@ unded after a lot of money , until one compar@@ es to the same time in the same countries and to our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the Bör@@ sen and the Real Estate prices .
thus , deb@@ ts and un@@ productive capital is the twin summit , which does not represent the standard market mechan@@ isms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe un@@ employed , and consequently , a low demand for global demand , which could not carry out a low demand in which they could not be able to kill him that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ inten@@ ds the circumstances which lead to them that Ö@@ di@@ pus him k@@ ills him .
that is my h@@ ill@@ ers with capit@@ alism --
his superior art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , human tal@@ ents and particularly all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are cru@@ cial for salvation of the earth .
is so democracy the solution ?
I think . but before we continue ? what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the corporate form , which the outdoors and the poor as a majority to control the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy lock , of course too many of --
women , fore@@ ign@@ ers , and of course sl@@ aves .
however , it would be an error , the job value of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to this sli@@ ps .
the decision of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was , and it is that they gave not only the right to free expression of the poor , but important and cru@@ cial , which they had the right to political comp@@ ilation with the same vote in questions of the state .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy has not kept long --
like a candle which light@@ eth very bright , she is also sc@@ anned .
however , our liberal liberal dem@@ ocrac@@ ies don &apos;t have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glori@@ ous revolution of 1688 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy focused on the free citizen and labour @-@ employed poor , the liberal democracy on the assets of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ulti@@ mat@@ ely became a stat@@ ute for glori@@ ous .
the liberal democracy occurred only when a complete separation of politics and economy are possible , and the democratic process was entered into the politics , while the world of concerts -- a dem@@ ocrac@@ ies @-@ free zone .
in our today &apos;s dem@@ ocrac@@ ies , since the time , in which the separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ numer@@ able battle between the two instead of the economy by the economy and dis@@ man@@ ages the policy .
do you wonder why the polit@@ icians are no longer like earlier ?
it is not an Deg@@ en@@ eration of their DNA .
it is necessary to be able to be in the government , and still not in power because the power from politics is applied to the economy and are separated by the areas .
I mentioned my h@@ ill@@ ers with capit@@ alism .
if you think about it , it is in about such as a herd of smoking , which so cle@@ ared the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that it was therefore hun@@ gry for the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that is so far too far by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of concerts grows , political goods are cancelled , the in@@ equality , and the assets of concerts are to be implemented , the cash of their companies will be invest@@ ing .
in the successful capital of capit@@ alism , the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher will distri@@ bute the twin summit , and so larger the con@@ spir@@ acy of human workers and wealth of mankind .
if it &apos;s true , it is evi@@ dent that we must re@@ cover the policy and the economy would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; will hold the control in the ancient Athens , apart from the excl@@ usion of sl@@ aves , women and fore@@ ign@@ ers .
this is no new idea .
the mar@@ x@@ ite lin@@ king had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not different .
the doctrine of the Soviet Union should be that the need@@ y need@@ y should only be carried out by a mir@@ acle of a mir@@ acles like in the ancient Athens , without new species of the breeding and con@@ spir@@ atory .
but there is a solution : create the poor poor !
capit@@ alism does it to re@@ placing low @-@ glo@@ bes , replaced by automation and rob@@ ots .
the problem is so long economy and politics of separate areas are , the automation will increase the twin summit , and the social conflic@@ ts de@@ eper , and the social conflic@@ ts de@@ eper than it -- already very soon , as I think -- in countries like China .
so we must re@@ design the economy and politics once again destro@@ ying the sector and politics , that we are dem@@ oc@@ ating the re@@ un@@ ified range hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy , which allows the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
the question is not , whether the capit@@ alism showed up the technical achievements , which he is brought to sur@@ vive , --
the interesting question is whether the capit@@ alism is similar to a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; or similar to those who serve their energy in the expl@@ oration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks of life of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would like it like it might look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like U@@ top@@ ia instead of &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation I would like to tell you , in all the soon , some examples are called .
in the area of companies : Ask a capital market in which one will des@@ erv@@ ed money , while you work and in which your capital is to next follows , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and out of income and the concept of wage work is entirely over@@ hau@@ led .
no differenti@@ ation of more between them which belong to the company , and employees working there , which the company is not part of the capital and work , no major le@@ av@@ ings between investment and sal@@ aries , and ulti@@ mat@@ ely no stri@@ ping ce@@ ar@@ ous@@ el summit .
in the area of global political economy : please note that our national currencies would have a free sw@@ ap exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Mon@@ etary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of all mankind .
imagine that the entire world trade is trad@@ ed in this currency -- as we call it &quot; the Kos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and any government pay the sum , which corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the trade sur@@ plus of the country , in a common fund .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment are r@@ ar .
this is no new idea .
it is bas@@ ically that John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es suggested in the Bret@@ ton Wo@@ ods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that it was not to use the technical funds at that time .
today we have , in particular , in front of a re@@ un@@ ified policy and economy .
the world , which I travelled to you , is also liber@@ ated in which they preferred privileg@@ ed people , and mar@@ x@@ ist@@ ically because they buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian , global ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will be aw@@ ak@@ ening in such a world .
or will we sin@@ ks in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we choose us polit@@ ically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you will be writ@@ able in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how important is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have spoken just said , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ un@@ ification of politics and economy is ... T@@ un , we won &apos;t generate the techn@@ ological development of a global decline in the global demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers are called &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transmission of this crisis of one part of the Earth on the next , how we experience it , it will not only be our dem@@ ocrac@@ ies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
if this analysis is true , Marx ra@@ v@@ ely relevant ,
likewise as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Ke@@ yn@@ es , and therefore I am perfectly conf@@ used .
BG : actually , and now we are well too .
Y@@ V : if you do not conf@@ used , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philos@@ oph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your talk , you chose Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner , you have clearly said that you keep from the view of the West on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a huge level of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal dem@@ ocrac@@ ies we have a democracy of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy on the policy , while the area , where the area doesn &apos;t play , -- the area of the economy -- a completely dem@@ ocrac@@ ies @-@ free zone .
in certain way , when I may say the prov@@ oc@@ ative , China is similar to the 19th century England .
because -- rec@@ all -- we t@@ end to connect Liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is an error , histor@@ ically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical , which affects the democratic development .
what you can now observe in China , similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is preparing to do that what the West in the 19th century itself did , sm@@ ell r@@ hom@@ ily according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curi@@ ous on your experiences as Finance Minister of Hell@@ as in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I think that this is coming .
BG : Yes ...
how do you look back to the first half months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a re@@ mission with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , of the self @-@ pleas@@ ing to adop@@ t and the digest@@ ion den@@ ial that a massive consoli@@ dation of the Eurozone fell by the Eurozone , and continues to become the development of all the European Union .
we had the opportunity to concl@@ ude on the basis of the Greek suburbs - by the way , the first suggest@@ ion that this den@@ ial may be revealed --
unfortunately it right . unfortunately , the powers will be elected within the euro zone , within the European group , continues to den@@ y the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
that is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you tried to have an economic system , which is not over@@ vi@@ able , by political will and author of life on the life , it might be hin@@ ts a while , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ ru@@ pt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what change you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we don &apos;t change their structure .
BG : have you made any error in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back --
if there is a finance minister , or any of the minister , that after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he had no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistake .
the greatest bug was to sign the application for the extension of the school program at the end of February .
I believed that there was a hon@@ est@@ able interest in the money of the money to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they wanted to do just our government , because they didn &apos;t want to emplo@@ y the promises , who ran in the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t have entered that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during &quot; Great Dep@@ ression &quot; .
None of the Tro@@ ika of the money enc@@ om@@ ed for us this policy has stood : &quot; that was a collective mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all the things , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , do not seem to be quite quite a European European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
my critic@@ ism of the European Union and the Eurozone , opposite som@@ eb@@ ody , who lives and loves .
my greatest an@@ xi@@ ety is that the Eurozone was not survived .
because if they do not sur@@ vive , the release of students will destroy them and destroy the European Union .
that will not have a cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy .
we probably are the strongest economy in the world .
if we out@@ lined ourselves the road to a post @-@ modern 1930 , then it appears to me , it will also be dre@@ aming for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thanks for you that you were with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy price have never heard most of it , although it is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enter@@ tain@@ ing minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is conduc@@ ting employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon production company is at Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an I@@ da@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for this , shows the shows and the content will produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fought industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy do not want to select your choice .
he must find shows that very well .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this bend .
this curve is the rating division of over 2500 TV series on the web site . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
if your show is valu@@ ed by nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , looking for a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , we are on this end , shows like &quot; Tod@@ dl@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should be enough to tell you what is at the end of the curve .
Roy price does not make sure to be on the left side of the curve , because I need only need special intelligence to offer &quot; Tod@@ dl@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on the middle of the middle , the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad are they insp@@ ire not .
so , he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something doing so that Roy has nothing risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first epis@@ ode of any of these shows and is online where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon is free things , you know , however , right ?
millions of spect@@ ators have seen this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed in the watching of these shows .
they will be wat@@ ched by Roy and his team to record all .
you capture , when you start the show when you p@@ ushed , which parts are over@@ taking or no@@ omet@@ imes again .
they collect millions of data to decide on these data that show them should produce them .
indeed , they collect the data , processing this and from this makes the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four repub@@ lican US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
Yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show cannot rec@@ all , because they did not so good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the true sense of the Word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lan@@ es at 7.5 -- so something about an average but not just that , wor@@ d@@ Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company , another manager is looking for a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming from Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for this a Super show and it also uses data to this , but it makes it something different .
instead of a competition , he and his team trad@@ es the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x vie@@ wers , so the reviews that they give the shows , whose shows they like etc .
then , in order to find these little details about the vie@@ wers : what shows they like that producer , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a car and decided to do not a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a dr@@ ama series over a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
Yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; gets an 9,1 rating on this curve . so , exactly where she wanted .
of course now the question : what is here ?
one has two very compet@@ itive , data se@@ ated companies .
they combine these many data and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because the logic some@@ how does that work should work .
if you collect million data , for a decision to meet you , then you should meet a good decision .
it has 200 years on statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computer .
the min@@ t what you can expect , is good TV , or ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is somewhat sc@@ ary , because we live in a time , in which we live more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond the television .
does anyone know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in touch with this software . come in contact with this software , you are in jail .
if anyone ask here in the US in prison , and to dis@@ order , it &apos;s probably that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ order is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad , it will be chosen whether a person is good or bad .
medi@@ um@@ ental TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but still more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . this is not the fact that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
also the data del@@ etes files are wrong .
Yes , even Google makes sometimes error .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can be conf@@ essed by data analysis of influ@@ enza , the worst type , predic@@ tions -- by data analysis of the Google Re@@ cher@@ ries .
it worked wonderful and was a great news sens@@ ation . the success gi@@ fted in a publication in the journal Nature &quot; in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year around the year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sens@@ ation , including the re@@ mark of publication in the journal Nature &quot; in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data s@@ ay@@ est companies such as Amazon and Google is sometimes thought sometimes .
despite all of these errors , data will be ex@@ empl@@ ated in decisions of life a -- at the workplace , in law en@@ for@@ cement , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
too , I know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ protected gen@@ etics -- a area where some very cl@@ ue people are un@@ able to meet many data to meet serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medic@@ inal . over the years I recognized some samples above the difference between successful decisions on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be widespread .
do you need to solve one more complex problem , do not do two things :
as a first place of this problem in its individual details , so you can analy@@ ze the single details ; as second place you put the single parts to bre@@ eds an eye .
sometimes you have to do this times , but there are always two things : get together and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to assem@@ ble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to use the parts and then to come to an end .
there is another tool and we have all : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is in@@ complete , then if the information is in@@ complete , it is especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have data and conf@@ used , where they also belong to the process .
they ut@@ ili@@ ze the audience to understand their audience , when they would not have been able to have been able to put all these parts , re@@ placing it and out a show such as &quot; House of Cards &quot; , it didn &apos;t work in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they were a great personal risk with this decision .
in contrast , Amazon was on the wrong way .
they used all their decisions to control all their decisions , first than they chose TV ideas as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; that tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think that things ren@@ ame automatically when data will start our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and not to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before the data was given , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no matter you need to get the ball to get a reply . &quot; highly probably &quot; -- precisely here in this moment . &quot;
I &apos;ll see it later with a technique demo .
I have met some decisions in my life , where I would have to listen to the ball in the night .
but , as you know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through a bit much compensation , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so , perhaps the ball l@@ ü@@ ger and cl@@ ü@@ ger and cl@@ ü@@ ger . ulti@@ mat@@ ely it &apos;s to meet the decisions , when we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right turn .
and I find it as a very encour@@ agement message that it is still going to pay decisions in spite of the great amount of data , decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks .
at the end there are not the data , but the risks , with which you lan@@ den at the right end of the turn .
thanks nice .
