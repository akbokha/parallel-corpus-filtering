<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They may know him, because he won the Pulitzer Pric for the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before each one had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen has written a book, in which he was spectacular, that the NSA is illegal phones by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's another chapter, that should leave a remaining impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic-secret service operation, which gave the CIA literally detention for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know who doesn't mean the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Almost 10 years the government has been identified against Risen and calls him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol for the patterns of the government, Whistleblower to condemn and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and if they are not able to protect the mud, they will praise them.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was anked in Risen, he did something that he did so much to him: he refused, and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were astonished for years that it would be indispensable for their case, the financial assets of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporter and sources can always be minished.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to failure and crises to say, these also could make his digital footwear for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigators, without understanding, his phone, his phone,</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit balance, and even travel expenses with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found them to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke to his lawyer, Whistleblower. but instead, the justice time has more convicted than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that's a problem, especially because the government can contribute to much of their work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about National Security was the result of that a histleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the press work on the game that will be protected by the first Constitutional Complaints, because the government always has more ways to try out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like the technology of the government allows the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can take up from the moment, in which they take contact, rather than in the descendants of the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that there was not yet been written when Risen was written, and it is considerably safe than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source-translation system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the capital of the Press Foundation, which has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of an e-mail you will go to a news site, as described here the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can also instantly upload documents or information, as in every usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, which have access to the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, the government cannot be described more information, and many of the information that would like it would be no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the substances to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments at all over the world always new spionagettechnologies that are all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's to ensure that this is not only technology-flops such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to bring iniquity. it's the same thing that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The more aboutings of the supply of soldiers are white and of overfill hospitals in the supply of soldiers. or the next environmental worker, the alarm to suspected water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider which warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies have not been made for those who want to cover the crimes, but to protect our fundamental rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data collection of history was released.] [what does this week have been hidden.] [what does it mean by Robert Palmer of Global widness.] this week, we were sent from messages about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's office firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of starters.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will receive an impression of it how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca go and say, "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you build it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, we actually see the e-mails, sharing news how the whole system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led the first direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian Dictator Bashar al-Assad correspondence firms in control oases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Well, there will be a lot of more people and others, the nervous of the next release is waiting for the next release.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now, like the plot of a agent, or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It appears to be removed from you, me, unusual people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should us read what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mice are able to hide their assets in taxoases, and not all their taxes, then it means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And it concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelation is phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret control oases of some few are used, their assets to hide and worshipped -- something that we discuss for ten years and cover them.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears to do this whole world very confusion, and it's hard to understand how this starters work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has an company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand that he is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans that came in these revelation to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there is no rich Americans to hide her assets in starters.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which this controller will work, mosbag Fonseca less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We would have a data collection of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Indeed, it's so that in some US states must not need more information, please specify less information to set a company as to get a library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This species of intransparency in the USA has allowed to zooming school children, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is subject to zooming, particularly appreciated anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior, which affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global widness, we'll need to figure out what this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigators to the offices of 13 cultivators in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as African ministers, to bring the suspects money to the US to buy a yacht, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked out that all the suggestions of our investigator suggestions, as he could transferring his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all predominations. None of these lawyers participated in clients, and of course it was handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It's also important to consider this not as a single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not possible to spread a single anwalt, who managed to spread the suggests proposal.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not around a single peak of politic, creases into a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is therefore how the system works by corruption, cursed, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">To do this, we have to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to create this type of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">This is all very warm sinks, as if we could do anything, but if nothing could have changed ever, than whether it is always the rich and Mighty.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as the owner, I see what I started to change one piece.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen lectures to more transparency, representing the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic was found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has been recorded in central registers on national level, who really stops behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most important facts is that the US is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of the parties have brought a bill in both parliaments, but this does not make the progress, we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of starters, used as a means to ensure funds in the U.S. and global for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who can see if they see how other people can hide their real identity after headmen.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need a guide to executives in the economy that rise and say, "Intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We use the leading politicians which recognize the problem and end to end this type of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can complete the intransparency that is now able to finish this kind of tax cursed, corruption and money supply, finally finish.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the boot of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in red Mazda was standing and looked back on.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made straight a roadtrip through whole country. thereafter he would go to peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I lud him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him, "Where are you sleep today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I said, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just did not know him! he says he would go to the Peace of Peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't kidnapped in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small car boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me, "I have a Air Mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Has, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I starred at the blanket and thought: "Oh my husband! what haven't I dried up?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild liveth in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got a fear that I went out of the bed, on toe peaks on the door, and my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The art works that he had bought from me, hung up today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who were waiting for?</seg>
<seg id="122">People living on my Air Mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the Air Mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a leap year, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleases, my participation has pulling out and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I drove that it was time a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think, Creativity can do it to convert anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new cooperation Brian Chesky: "Brian, I recessed such as we could earn something. our apartment will stay at an Designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded "Air Mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the Air Mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelet is completely different, because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we also administered our last guest, and the door came into the castle, starred Brian and myself.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had just discovered that we could find new friends and pay our hire at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former cooperation, nate Blecharczyk, ended us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented our investors: "we would like to create a website, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the type rooms, whose doors is closes, when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Then, on the internet, they can invite you to a strange person to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would be.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one that is still very near Trost, would invest in a business to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, you have to work on the things that can be good. we could be able.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the art academy we learned that the design has much more than just appearance and hustle -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to create objects, but now we wanted by design immortlessness, between people who had never met earlier.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design such as something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you an KOSTPROBE, which degree trust we ansted.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it is out of your combination zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone with your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This empty plough of panic, you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel the door when they open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that's more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can't just read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they stay differently.</seg>
<seg id="163">For this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just times so, who doesn't have Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you see on Twitter, that he is dipped to the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What would be if we have changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had to be revealed once again with his name, if he tells, whence he comes, how his dog or his children promised?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that they would have 150 departments that all say, "It can really be very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then feel when you need to enter your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a good feedback system strengthens the confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people, negative operations.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait for both host as well as guest their operations were published before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted Stanford a study carried out. we studied, as probably it is to trust one another, depending on how they are similar to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly trust we trust the people most that are on the most common.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social presiege.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting, it is exciting when you added the call for a person -- in our case by Beurteilungen.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three departments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So, the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots in love.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we drove that confidence is dependent on how much you are inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you're looking for too little, as for example, Hi!, "one gets no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tells you much as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also rather assumed.</seg>
<seg id="190">So, there is an optimal degree in openness, such as "Tolle art works in your dwelling place! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design, to produce this degree?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount text. we also give tips to which topics should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages compared to strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">Wherewith we didn't reckoned, the great multitude of people who were more than ready to lay these ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people will take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a demand that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there is also times, if not everything goes straight.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated celebrations in celebrations or apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Guests have been able to leave guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood in front of the front when confidence is broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing of limmerit than these calls. it is right now, if I just remember it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which is heard in the voice of Ancfer, and is always our biggest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, the 123 million surveyed nights had only a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people confidential together one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, can be mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He spends up blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for passengers traveling with seated activities on heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protection level that save one's life though they don't know even properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You go one in your own car to hospital when you die, and wait for a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel at all, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer, without extra charge, without extra charge.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to reach the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I was the term for the first time, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of section with money transforms together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This goes here to a economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it just now "rental industry" to call it, will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, talking about human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves, and changes every thing.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you are going to compare it with fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would however, if travelling have a rich buffet from local impress?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be if you want to visit a group there, a group there would fill a thoroughly to fill a thoroughly found and one at an Kneiving tour, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you want to learn a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, they are designed in accordance with the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be if we would like apartments of the reason to collaborating?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would happen if cities would accept the idea of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I stayed in the cities that make us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depression.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea of Seoul, this project was already begun. many parking, belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Now living inhabitants are offered. students who were on searching for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">They were committed to people, whose children were moved. there were also incubation programs,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people will be guest in 191 countries worldwide with a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seem to be so mad, as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing we realized that you can find out the correct design of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep parts.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it,</seg>
<seg id="251">Right overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda is gone on me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design is not able to solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I ask myself, what we can be coming soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed the brains, a terror attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay for security control at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is true true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are the people, as I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study showed that 80% of coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans know mine, most would have no Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people did not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who never have never know a Muslims, it is great you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say unto you that I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I'm a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am resolved,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Furnace-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to use me.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to bear the Hijab, my Headpiece.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why did you teach you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The lathy was: at that time it was for me a feminist independence of independence, which I felt as 17-year-old, I felt a perfect and unbelievable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I haven't just missed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the Koran extensions.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, in question, doubted and believed ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confidence and sore devotion, which is deepened with every reading of the corans.</seg>
<seg id="284">Sometimes the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to the wake.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know yourself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever get the feeling that somebody you perceive fully, and yet somehow love?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineers.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the findings of the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the awful morning arrived in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you do not remember, where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had too late at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "rapid message."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flown in buildings, people living in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">A accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My sweock related rapidly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "Jihad..."... "...</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country. but in the Nu related me the deeds from another of a civil war in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to travel through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we drove me -- as low as we went into my seat, and I was afraid of the first time when Muslims can be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment in our apartment, in a new city where it was like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I heard and read the warnings of the National Islamic organizations that discuss: "be careful," "be careful," "be careful in well lit up," "assembling you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered for the bed.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again, the warnings: "go not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw my extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were unintentionally unfiltered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who stayed for Muslims, held free and smote for Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really burning grips on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I said: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt really felt.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country, our country was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="315">I deposited the people of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was awesome.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the excuse, which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can hear people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to close Muslims and Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or Gutartig?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a marinarian tumour, one keeps only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senselless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, such as all other Americans, no tumour in the body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first helpers and the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosque America secured?</seg>
<seg id="331">It will not keep a few parking lot, but not the terror stop.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to view the other faith tolerant, and larger civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, D.C. recently told: people will not be radialised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They will be radialised in their cellar, or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When the release of the radio process has found that it is online. as the first one will be able to do the extremly group, that the person may believe, the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior, and their ideology, is a betrayed or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent Radikalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group justified like the IS their breeding ality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, as a mother, I believe that we must do anything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would put us into their lecture world if you have recognised as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you throws a look at them, they do not drives what they are in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their breeding ality that they can read these things into writing.</seg>
<seg id="346">An extraordinary Imam telling me recently an amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because it had regard to the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they have been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. each intellectual, with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence, and said that their wrath kindled the sense in the world, they would only bring trouble in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired by anything that their mind has been given, she was an main goal for the instrumentisation of extremists who had a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the connection to God and their congregation.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than to accuse her Wut, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, preserved them before the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy, focusing on our thought freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study - actually several neuroscientist studies -- show: if we fear, we will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept an autonomous government system, conformity and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one reports testifications messages, in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they also agree to a military attack on Muslim countries, as well as the inclusion of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the moods against Muslims after Muslims left -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="363">It was in the court of the war in Iraq and two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to moslem terror, as I have expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It is actually a tool to the public manipulation to the public, to exits the foundation of a free society, sensible and well informed citizen.</seg>
<seg id="366">The dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel as first but the poisonous air of fear fell to us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, it is not only to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweet, great man, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her life. she was hoped and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is that of my breasts have become a versified young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne, her brother and his wife, her husband, Craig Stephen Hicks, who was murdered in the afternoon. he did it in their apartment, as in the execution, after he had posted to Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be unmoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we walked to the mosque, or remained safe working at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discuss it and for us it was no light decision, because it went to America that we would like to control our children: one that would control us through anxiety, or one, in which we can consult our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We were silent with our son in the nursing seat, with high pressure at the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and went out my shoes, went into the prayer shalle, and what I looked, let me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thank you and called our guests, because half of the gathered Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who were come, not for us to attack us, but for us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have broken.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and co-feeling panic and ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from fear and the Fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you close to those who are my: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself what do you say that you can claim a TEDTalk, a memorial with draught that are working in a noble monument factory, so there is no exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't have. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I usually have so much as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you can look at Muslims of the world, and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study of Muslims come across the world, people want human things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to be well-known for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as an exception, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What a platform for Bastler began, just before that, a millimeter business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is possible in research institutes worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcel dismissed in our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the frac Centre in France live in front of a six metre high tower of 1 500 goat. some years ago she started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Due to a connecting flight machines, high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up seldom able structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learnt to bear lute to react with turbulence and general on nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the remover in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">Thus, a system of autonomous works, it must know collective complaints, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There is no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flying machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are of the highest Ebene. e.g. "" and "landen."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">One flight unit, that tries to beat two flying flap with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrgglers it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most high-volatile glasses, it can be floating, and has a lot of great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeper.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailor is that they react sensitive to turbulences such as wind boarches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea is behind that the flight device doesn't matter the optimal position, and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic abstract questions about the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as the machines with a thousand mobile parts that are merged to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, pilots trained pilots remote-controlled flight machines, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tailruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with just one working.</seg>
<seg id="436">That is the monospinner, the mechanically delightful remotier. it was invented in front of short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clapping, hinges and transverse, no further actuator or control areas, just a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although mechanically simple, it's very much to fly in the inner life, so it can fly stable, and can move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the rear light. to bring it to the flies, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood, it's right to throw, if all to see me is small, so Show me a video that was filmed in yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in gendarity, this machine is here, the Omnifeeder with its eight propellers, an exercise in excess of flow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he was not symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way, he receives the most aulicable skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room to move in all directions, no matter what he is turned, or even as he rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight parts.</seg>
<seg id="449">One piece is able to be able in models directly with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines once become part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If you rebuild them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a engine or propeller is falling down, electronics or a battery - can continue flying the machine if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that we are going to make a half flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was analysed synthetic vibration.</seg>
<seg id="459">The great number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a pallet of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took a common micro Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit it with localisationships and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit is white, where she is irregulated and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you will motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Broadway, the particularly safe machine, you want to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it's hard to be predicting the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wages in development and the skin act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, rich flaming, they have to form so spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology soldered massives and economical potential, is the scarfs on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">In a very long distant galaxy, two black holes in a very wide distant galaxy, two black holes are always faster, they turned into the mass of three Sunes in a tenth of pure energy in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, she lightened her brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy, they were not free in the form of light -</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time poem itself and the universe exploded in Gravitationswelles.</seg>
<seg id="475">We first notice at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, a combined life was created on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth: corals, fishes, plants, Saurier, people and -- God stand up with -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Approximately 25 years ago, a group of Much -- Rai White and Ronald Drever decided to build a giant laser detector to build a giant laser detector to search for gravitational health, which are caused by Colombian black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held it for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people know it as a mad genius, so that the US National Science Foundation contributed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">According to the decade of decade, design, conception and extremely harder work they built the Detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometric Observatory Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, precision of LIGO could significantly improved considerably, which improved the detection capacity enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO now.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO has started a last test run around some smaller, hard problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitationsware of the two colliaments of black holes through the ground.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: two moments in my life were emotional than these:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In the basically, the fruits of my life was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that, what I had worked, is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he studied gravitationswals from black holes since 23 years. what are Gravitationswals?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation time is a cabling of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the front of the shaft, the space and its total content will be extended into one direction, and the other stolen.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate lecturers in courses for the relevance theory, often have a really albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that Gravitationsware extremely weak, even smile.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, everybody was extended with us at the meeting of the waves and stolen. elongation of an average people were 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1st half, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandths of a nuclear core. that is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic report about Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt after the waves: "the technical difficulties of such detectors are rape.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are erotic and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claimed, LIGO be more than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wave length, which is much smaller than the things around us: face, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practically. for example, you can make a picture or a map of dingen, by using the multiple points of the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">Sounds are different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it's very hard, actually impossible to produce a picture of Dingen, which mean you especially much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we wait for certain properties like audio and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"born Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to Gravitationswelles.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking forward to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can listen to all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to laurel, can reach us about the collision of two black holes that my colleague Scott are already very long employed.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not turned holes, pen: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies are very fast, hears the same circles with an additional sound change. it sounds like: WU-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement, shaped into the wave shape.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that I will never forget -- heard LIGO following: [Surrender noise] Jenny, who knows how to hear this when the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 filler compound, which move around as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: superior to us, what does that mean.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the thickest body in all, one with a mass of 29 Sun, the other with a mass of 36 Sun, revolve a hundred times a second before they were collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine that forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it, because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet a beautiful new way to explore the universe, as they never had previously made possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can hear the All and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can see -- practically or in basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why we explode stars in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about that.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical precautions could happen in the core, which lies behind thousands kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see you, since this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitationswelles passes iron, as it would be transparent glass. the Urknall: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe. but we will never see it, since the urbite is covered by his own observations.</seg>
<seg id="541">Thanks to Gravitationswellen, it should be possible until the beginning of the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that's most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we never have never seen, and of whom we never have never seen. things we can only explore.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO was right in the first run of Things we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague on the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project says to this topic: me: the kind of stars, the black holes, are the Dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sauerkraut for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us a completely different viewing angle on the events in the All, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be so far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to get great detectors and the noise and circles of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a very new generation of observatories on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what might be more beautiful than the Urknall itself too laugh?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tasted a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year I would say to everything "Yes!" to say that I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">Regardless of whether it made me nervous, me in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes" to say. "</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live in television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Do I want to play with the Schauplay?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly that, wovor I was afraid, eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear that keep my social anxiety -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"Yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"Yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life, on an unexpected art. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson, and Emerson, the youngest ones, calls for unexplained reasons. "</seg>
<seg id="570">It would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need to use milk for my Schnabeltasse."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me when I could play with her, when I was just on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life of living in my family. from there I'm thinking about to play with them when you can do with them. no matter what I'm doing, or whither I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a devastating side effect: only recently, I didn't understand that the "Yes" Sages to play with my children's career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think about things, bring to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">For this TV season, I'm responsible for the world to add 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Any of the shipment offers hundreds jobs that existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a TV episode can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">Another episode all nine days of four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows that simultaneously are in production, times four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run in succession on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">On all over the world, my series will run in 256 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 these 70 TV-hours are broadcast, which I have created itself, and not only produced, so still obena. I must find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who makes it yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think when the word "author does."</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you all of you that are so hard working, whether you say a company, a land or a household, that I do not only am the computer, and it is true when I say: I understand that there is a dream job of dream.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I have been working much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">If I'm deepened to work in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work will always be a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set troops on a screen, I found on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream man a high tone, loving a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that of the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, challenging and exemptive, funny and disruptive, clinically and mommy, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me if the work is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the Summen hears like a bellion road, I could always go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, when I call them the smen that I speak about writing to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Summen -- when I started working with the television production, when I started to work and to work, to create and work together, I discovered this matter what energy. the Summen!</seg>
<seg id="618">The Summen is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The Summen is action and activity. the Summen is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Summen is music. the Summen is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summen is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't leave differently than to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not unlike size to dispute, regardless of the price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps there is also a workout olic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps this is Genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is fear of premeits.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not for the failure, and I know only that I love the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to be clear: the more successful I will, ever more broadcasts, the more work, the more work, the more, the more time, the more watch me, the more can I write history, so more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work, to be successful, the more needs to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the Summen, the Summen, the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the Summen. I am the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only do this lmen?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overstressed, exaggerated, exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The Summen stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters have been reconciled to the truth that their mum is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tell people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimate, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanic.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the Summen were ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The Summen of Motors did store.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Summen did not return.</seg>
<seg id="652">My Summen was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things like always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-day, convincing weekends, no reproduction, don't keep nothing, with a whole heart, clear eyes, whatever is always.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview of Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the Summen and the Summen I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what if you do, what you do, who loves work, dying out suddenly?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may remember: "hypocrite you, Blöder writer-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it works, one man do, one teacher, a painker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the Summen stops when the Summen stops when the Summen stops, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Is I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart hear, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I'll make my "Southern States waitress" a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way to outside, late inside and she says, "Mama, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no, as to me two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to speak and second, she called me not "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm looking at Titan am and my Summen, and here all changes my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so they say, "Mama, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters, we laugh much and I read out very dramatically from the book "evered poets."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the Summens, I can do nothing but not to miss out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I focused on.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they exist no more.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists if you're sticky fingers and damsel kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and song, in which it's Losses, or whatever is the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so almost that I can hardly be breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolved.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy recovery is coming.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Summen come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly ever, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the Summen, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel that I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's let us stay on the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The Summen, the working environment, the Titanic, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, if I say to you, who am I, if I have been managing the aid of shipments and television lessons, and how working my brain, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The Summen is no strength and it is unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real Summen is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The Summen is the river which comes from the vitae.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real Summen is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignored the pressure of history, which contribute to inherent tasks, expectation and print.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real Summen is simple and originally.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buckness is God's voice in my ear, but maybe even whispered God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, a lot more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child will play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I usually make sure that I can open me as a workouts of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I like it not.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play me not ansing, as we work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always have been working, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better in the workplace as daheim.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a man is working rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">Let me honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxing, is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We quickly around in the garden, before and back, and her.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small Dance-Parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We split bubble bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel the mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always leave to my phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the Summen of the universe fulfills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we do with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">They can also say. they always say Yes, if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me for naiv, for a dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child takes you less interesting, than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes with me, until they make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, take a Marienker or biscuit.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teenagers speaks whole 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, no need not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can bring 15 minutes on the piece, even at a bad-Laune day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on each!</seg>
<seg id="754">No phone, no wash, no support.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinners, the children were ready ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drin!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-felt, my world. there must not be the children. it is to feel the Summen to feel a place for his mind in peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with his own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Take the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out there and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm coming and I wins. friends meeting you read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is just for everything that I had given my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to surpass more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on each, why not full 15 minutes away?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The Summen came back in my leisure time. the Summen seem to return, if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work with games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door, the energy flow, and I find me in my office. I hear me about new ideas. the Summen underwent back to new ideas. I use it in full breed and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the Summen, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the Summen, the Summen is not I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Mix and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is now my Summen.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summen of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Summen of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Summen of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so danceable.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is scourage to me that I am a Titan. I never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I still have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my storage fire burn still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happy are I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more feelings I feel good.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the Summen, the Summen, the other, the Summen of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel the feelings, the more makes this unusual, beating naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sorts, the more I know that I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think of me, I bring to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream man should be a bit dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I'm neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">How most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from one second on the other, after a heavy punishment, or after an autoincident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us, neurosurgery is very frustrating that the brain is in contrast to other body organs, a very small ability to healing self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, tries to improve the nervous function by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Safe they have one of the most famous, the "deep-irnstimulation." in order to influence a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurologic function has improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, who suffered severe threaten and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approaching us this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to demonstrate that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was chief captain and working day and night in the emergency stop.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I treated patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that skull-Hirn-traumata the brain rotates the brain and the skull retenant.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save the life, you need to reduce the pinness pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this purpose, you have to remove a part of the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the tilene brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">That is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue increase, is comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the correct food, temperature, humidity and the environments to let them go.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that, we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts to pursue Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as such as a cellular culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you can still know from the biology class that family cells are unmature cells, which can transform themselves in any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has trunk cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small nical of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal cells are very active -- they are very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They turned slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like the cells, but it looked differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We need to understand how to understand whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">This blue and red cells are hot cortin positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandbrain error.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the fetus, they provide the folding of brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that she participated in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, a thing is clear -- from these cells we received our family cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are located before a potential cell source, the brain halves.</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brain particles from the non-known area and then the cells exactly as culturing, as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then marketed colored, to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">During the last step, we planted them at the acceptance of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions were: what happens if we reimplantable this cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplantable the same cells in business brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that they had been taken away after some weeks, they would have been taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a violation and implantable exactly the same cells and now remained the cells as they were neurneyed neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we were able to watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that show them are these small points. these are the cells that we are in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we practice the monkeys with a manual transmission.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets by a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable level of stable level, we last used in the motorized Cortex the Handmotik area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then try to recover with help plastic mechanisms. you can pick up to a certain degree as well as the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey has reached the degrees of the spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the no wise, who turn off spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original output from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the tire plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can say you, that were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about this cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to impressing people in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the funds to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely go.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question, which are the greatest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials on people.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from this great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: Yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed the research and tested the permission to start of clinical studies. if you continue to see in the future, how many years it takes you to enter into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then, this study must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You first really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thanks for your visit to the TED and that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We will make a great bug to consider it as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see the democracy of democracy, which is in reality, but the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unchangeable value.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism was forced to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great aftermatters in Beijing have proven doubt that it is possible to have a flowering capitalism and impressive growth, while the politics remains completely undecologically.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, the democracy change in us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmissable to me as a financial minister in the euro group, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- does not affect the savings programs, which were in Greece in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my appearing friends who would repeat me if the democracy would happen if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce a economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beg you to believe together with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup could save an iridescent, we could save us the democracy, but that we need a true and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Since without democracy, our societies are painted, our future dark and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject, I would like to consider an interesting advisory contradiction at present our host messages.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call the "ZwillingsSummit Summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known you. they know and know him as the Schuldenberg that throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few know his twillings.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which are confident savings and concerts, which could be able to invest there, where it would produce productive and revenues, with which one might produce the debt, and also all the things could be urgently needed, for example "green" Energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months were invested in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars invested in all the well-being produced goods, such as industrial installations, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, gleise, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounded after a lot of money, until one compares to the same time in the same countries and to our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the Börsen and the Real Estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital is the twin summit, which does not represent the standard market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently, a low demand for global demand, which could not carry out a low demand in which they could not be able to kill him that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintends the circumstances which lead to them that Ödipus him kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hillers with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His superior art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, human talents and particularly all the technologies to finance, "green" technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is so democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue? what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, which the outdoors and the poor as a majority to control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenical democracy lock, of course too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error, the job value of the athenian democracy due to this slips.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the athenian democracy was, and it is that they gave not only the right to free expression of the poor, but important and crucial, which they had the right to political compilation with the same vote in questions of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy has not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle which lighteth very bright, she is also scanned.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal liberal democracies don't have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenical democracy focused on the free citizen and labour-employed poor, the liberal democracy on the assets of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for glorious.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy occurred only when a complete separation of politics and economy are possible, and the democratic process was entered into the politics, while the world of concerts -- a democracies-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our today's democracies, since the time, in which the separation of politics and economy began, an innumerable battle between the two instead of the economy by the economy and dismanages the policy.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not an Degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is necessary to be able to be in the government, and still not in power because the power from politics is applied to the economy and are separated by the areas.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hillers with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about such as a herd of smoking, which so cleared the animals, of which they are nourished, decimated that it was therefore hungry for the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that is so far too far by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of concerts grows, political goods are cancelled, the inequality, and the assets of concerts are to be implemented, the cash of their companies will be investing.</seg>
<seg id="948">In the successful capital of capitalism, the "Demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher will distribute the twin summit, and so larger the conspiracy of human workers and wealth of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If it's true, it is evident that we must recover the policy and the economy would be better if the "Demos" will hold the control in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxite linking had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not different.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Soviet Union should be that the needy needy should only be carried out by a miracle of a miracles like in the ancient Athens, without new species of the breeding and conspiratory.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: create the poor poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it to replacing low-globes, replaced by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is so long economy and politics of separate areas are, the automation will increase the twin summit, and the social conflicts deeper, and the social conflicts deeper than it -- already very soon, as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must redesign the economy and politics once again destroying the sector and politics, that we are democating the reunified range hyperautocracy, which allows the film "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not, whether the capitalism showed up the technical achievements, which he is brought to survive, --</seg>
<seg id="958">The interesting question is whether the capitalism is similar to a dystopia, similar to the "Matrix" "or similar to those who serve their energy in the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks of life of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would like it like it might look like this "Star Trek" -like Utopia instead of "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to tell you, in all the soon, some examples are called.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: Ask a capital market in which one will deserved money, while you work and in which your capital is to next follows, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and out of income and the concept of wage work is entirely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation of more between them which belong to the company, and employees working there, which the company is not part of the capital and work, no major leavings between investment and salaries, and ultimately no striping cearousel summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please note that our national currencies would have a free swap exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- as we call it "the Kosmos," in units of "Cosmos" '-- and any government pay the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country, in a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically that John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not to use the technical funds at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have, in particular, in front of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I travelled to you, is also liberated in which they preferred privileged people, and marxistically because they buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will be awakening in such a world.</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sinks in a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we choose us politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You will be writable in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How important is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have spoken just said, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Tun, we won't generate the technological development of a global decline in the global demand, which Larry Summers are called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transmission of this crisis of one part of the Earth on the next, how we experience it, it will not only be our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx ravely relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am perfectly confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you do not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said. BG: in your talk, you chose Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner, you have clearly said that you keep from the view of the West on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a huge level of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have a democracy of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy on the policy, while the area, where the area doesn't play, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democracies-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain way, when I may say the provocative, China is similar to the 19th century England.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- recall -- we tend to connect Liberalism to democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical, which affects the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can now observe in China, similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is preparing to do that what the West in the 19th century itself did, smell rhomily according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious on your experiences as Finance Minister of Hellas in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I think that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: Yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back to the first half months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a remission with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, of the self-pleasing to adopt and the digestion denial that a massive consolidation of the Eurozone fell by the Eurozone, and continues to become the development of all the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to conclude on the basis of the Greek suburbs - by the way, the first suggestion that this denial may be revealed --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately it right. unfortunately, the powers will be elected within the euro zone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you tried to have an economic system, which is not overviable, by political will and author of life on the life, it might be hints a while, but if the change happens, it happens abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we don't change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any error in your time as a financial minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back --</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any of the minister, that after 6 months in office, especially in a so-called situation, he had no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest bug was to sign the application for the extension of the school program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a honestable interest in the money of the money to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They wanted to do just our government, because they didn't want to employ the promises, who ran in the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't have entered that they had been a catastrophic programme for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during "Great Depression".</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the money encomed for us this policy has stood: "that was a collective mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all the things, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, do not seem to be quite quite a European European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone, opposite somebody, who lives and loves.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest anxiety is that the Eurozone was not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Because if they do not survive, the release of students will destroy them and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">That will not have a catastrophic consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We probably are the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we outlined ourselves the road to a post-modern 1930, then it appears to me, it will also be dreaming for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thanks for you that you were with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy price have never heard most of it, although it is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conducting employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon production company is at Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has an Idafrisur and describes Twitter as "films, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for this, shows the shows and the content will produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy do not want to select your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that very well.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating division of over 2500 TV series on the web site. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued by nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bath," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, looking for a season, your brain asks: "where is there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, we are on this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should be enough to tell you what is at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy price does not make sure to be on the left side of the curve, because I need only need special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on the middle of the middle, the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad are they inspire not.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So, he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something doing so that Roy has nothing risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of any of these shows and is online where they can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is free things, you know, however, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators have seen this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed in the watching of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They will be watched by Roy and his team to record all.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture, when you start the show when you pushed, which parts are overtaking or noometimes again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide on these data that show them should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">Indeed, they collect the data, processing this and from this makes the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of these show cannot recall, because they did not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- in the true sense of the Word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lanes at 7.5 -- so something about an average but not just that, wordRoy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company, another manager is looking for a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming from Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for this a Super show and it also uses data to this, but it makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team trades the existing data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews that they give the shows, whose shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then, in order to find these little details about the viewers: what shows they like that producer, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a car and decided to do not a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series over a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" gets an 9,1 rating on this curve. so, exactly where she wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course now the question: what is here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data seated companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow does that work should work.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect million data, for a decision to meet you, then you should meet a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years on statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mint what you can expect, is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is somewhat scary, because we live in a time, in which we live more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in touch with this software. come in contact with this software, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone ask here in the US in prison, and to disorder, it's probably that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a disorder is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad, it will be chosen whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediumental TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but still more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not the fact that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data deletes files are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes sometimes error.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can be confessed by data analysis of influenza, the worst type, predictions -- by data analysis of the Google Recherries.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success gifted in a publication in the journal Nature "in the journal Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year around the year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the remark of publication in the journal Nature "in the journal Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sayest companies such as Amazon and Google is sometimes thought sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these errors, data will be exemplated in decisions of life a -- at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Too, I know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-protected genetics -- a area where some very clue people are unable to meet many data to meet serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicinal. over the years I recognized some samples above the difference between successful decisions on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be widespread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you need to solve one more complex problem, do not do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first place of this problem in its individual details, so you can analyze the single details; as second place you put the single parts to breeds an eye.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this times, but there are always two things: get together and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to assemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to use the parts and then to come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we have all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, then if the information is incomplete, it is especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore I think, Netflix was so successful because they have data and confused, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They utilize the audience to understand their audience, when they would not have been able to have been able to put all these parts, replacing it and out a show such as "House of Cards", it didn't work in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they were a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">In contrast, Amazon was on the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used all their decisions to control all their decisions, first than they chose TV ideas as they chose "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "that tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think that things rename automatically when data will start our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and not to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before the data was given, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no matter you need to get the ball to get a reply. "highly probably" -- precisely here in this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll see it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life, where I would have to listen to the ball in the night.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through a bit much compensation, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So, perhaps the ball lüger and clüger and clüger. ultimately it's to meet the decisions, when we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I find it as a very encouragement message that it is still going to pay decisions in spite of the great amount of data, decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">At the end there are not the data, but the risks, with which you landen at the right end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
