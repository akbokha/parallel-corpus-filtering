Munich 1856 : four cards that change your eyes to the city
an ir@@ ren sh@@ ades , where they are subject to a youth .
a sal@@ ary chapel , where is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers contri@@ but@@ able to the former foundation of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promot@@ es exciting stories about days .
it is anno@@ ying when maps are not currently available .
the kn@@ ow@@ eth everyone who had to be repeated twice , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i takes place instead of a green me@@ adow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently , but now is very happy .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then , as cities and municip@@ alities in the neighbour@@ hood area of Munich has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ carpet to recognize one as such as such as such as such as such .
in the large super@@ visory board , towns and municip@@ alities have been collabor@@ ated for cities and municip@@ alities in detail , so @-@ called Ur@@ position sheets .
these were developed according to the Bavarian State Treaty between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement of the Bay@@ ern@@ s .
your client : Napoleon .
the French Army Guide occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Co@@ alition War with Austria .
in Napoleon you wish an overview of the occupied country and gave a to@@ po@@ graphic recording of Bay@@ ern@@ s into order - of course of course .
even when the French troops entered the Lun@@ é@@ ville &apos;s peace of 9 February , 1801 there were today &apos;s neigh@@ bo@@ urs that created the idea of an extensive Bavaria @-@ card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thereby the Bavarian State Treaty .
the Ur@@ sel@@ s@@ blatt for Munich is born in 1856 and is like all the other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of fruit / today is the example of the state capital at the most op@@ pressed .
the town has expanded into all directions and has grown to all directions .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ dling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
Sen@@ dling was founded 21 years after creation of the card , i.e. 1877 , when the Munich district .
today , Underground are located in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ sen@@ ds focus around 1856 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ erst@@ raße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Executive Board of the Bavarian farmers in 1705 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as fields - at the first glance : when a single @-@ small card appears with d@@ utz@@ ing lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ photo , &quot; out of the corn@@ erst@@ one .
small plots there are no farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ dling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , at 1810 Schau@@ f@@ platz , was in the 19th century , actually a me@@ adow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historic card gives in@@ sight into the history of p@@ sychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ sel@@ s@@ blatt , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen just reads the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or of the &quot; height &quot; on the fans &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
Yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field Road to un@@ locked people with w@@ aking orders .
in 1858 / 59 , the Munich Region @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was created on the Au@@ er fans . &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gud@@ den led the establishment of the p@@ sychiat@@ rist , which was brought into the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was advanced for his time and finished for example the suit of the so @-@ called ir@@ ren .
in addition , he has taught the staff , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
first of 280 patients was first place , then it was expanded to 500 seats .
somet@@ ime , this capacity is not enough - the reason for the construction of the county of Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest p@@ sychiat@@ ry in Germany .
at the area of former Au@@ stri@@ ans , young people met in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and emig@@ rated to a youth home with training .
located west of the TS@@ V Munich Ost , east residential homes from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was established in architectural bure@@ au@@ re@@ ation of the origins of the Irish War , which had been destroyed during the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz was in 1856 as &quot; Head Square , &quot; the department of Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was &quot; Kauf@@ inger Gasse . &quot;
a decisive change brought a decisive change in the Second World War .
the bom@@ bs of the Allied risk opened in December 1944 , many holes in the city centre .
one big stayed until today - on Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a sal@@ ary chapel from the Middle A@@ ges were once approved at the Mari@@ enhof , where those days are working and will take place on April 5 , 2017 at the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn .
remove the old Munich @-@ map with the air@@ picture of today and fill up the hole to the Mari@@ enhof at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights published Travel Guide for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for promotion of color has issued a warning for colored people who travel on dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating politics and the rapid attacks of the state to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Ad@@ visory Service for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , will be appe@@ aring in force by August 28 , 2017 , pro@@ pose a number of frag@@ ran@@ ces , terrace @-@ based lectures in the last time in the entire state and here , &quot; it is written in the position of opinion .
a recent law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people heav@@ ier to win dis@@ cri@@ mination on min@@ orities , as well as the pro@@ secution of the state , as well as the dis@@ claim@@ ing the group called the journey , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have viol@@ ations of the civil rights to pass through people .
they are attached to their skin colors , they are merg@@ ed or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we will hear such as a frequency , which we don &apos;t have heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that has exhibited the organisation for a state in the USA .
the group quoted as rapid consist@@ encies against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and death of T@@ ory Sand@@ ers , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
sand@@ ers died under frag@@ ile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol longer , and was accused by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in custody without a crime of crimes .
the Council also shows a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which black car driver will be more likely to be 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families , friends and employees , what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be ready to bring your ch@@ im@@ ing money or the rel@@ atives that they go through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported in 2015 100 hate , according to the latest numbers from the Hass@@ ver@@ bre@@ ach report of the F@@ BI , which entered the state in terms of the number of such inju@@ ries on the 16th place of the country .
the it@@ iner@@ ation is also a reply to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law which would be difficult , a company due to residential or employment dis@@ cri@@ mination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) were issued for Texas and Arizona , after the States accused of immig@@ ration authorities to arrested people because of immig@@ ration laws , which will contri@@ bute to the AC@@ L@@ U for further r@@ enting pro@@ filed .
it@@ iner@@ aries will be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but in the last time , adv@@ oc@@ acy groups should be used in response to certain laws and trends within the USA .
Wei@@ dec@@ eption is el@@ ement@@ ar
F@@ ish@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in next year .
the CD@@ U Parliament &apos;s CD@@ U Parliament and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have a picture in front of the place .
at the Law@@ yer of the Schw@@ end@@ emann family , representatives of the F@@ ish@@ bacher CD@@ U city network met with the Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MP@@ s .
Markus Schw@@ end@@ emann rep@@ aired in@@ sights into its operation , in which he accommod@@ ates 55 hectares of me@@ adows and 40 hectares of forest cultiv@@ ates , 40 milk k@@ iss@@ es and also many young animals and are accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
the &quot; Black Forest Milk &quot; is responsible for him the alternative @-@ market@@ able way for the milk of his c@@ ows , so Schw@@ end@@ emann .
on the table of the holidays comes exclusively for regional .
since he also is BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of F@@ ish@@ bach , he called the Wei@@ dec@@ eption project as &quot; el@@ ement@@ ar &quot; . &quot;
I can &apos;t be able to ste@@ al ste@@ al surfaces .
the green area conc@@ ern for a lot of work , many m@@ ute with the engine sense .
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the to@@ po@@ graphy with the to@@ po@@ graphy .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ ial operation and managed to use this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he is no bio @-@ operation .
for may@@ or Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the local community has recognized the meaning of the turn@@ key projects and is glad about the leader . &quot;
with costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers have to be supported .
it is hope that the collection can still be sent out for a whole while .
&quot; the biggest treasure which we have , are the people who work in agriculture and are thought out as they bring their farm , &quot; entered the may@@ or .
the farmers stand for the promotion often in the critic@@ ism
a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the re@@ furb@@ ishment area is about 40 hectares , which will not be en@@ for@@ ated until at least 2023 .
half of the total cost of € 71 million , half of the leader was funded by the village of F@@ ish@@ bach .
thus , the farmers stayed 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schw@@ end@@ emann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac bet@@ onte : &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers and country .
also for Peter White stood : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot;
the Regional Assembly line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg is allowing the state support of turn@@ tables .
the goal is the pro@@ position of the Black Forest .
a pre@@ condition is the presence of one of the L@@ PR identified by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the resulting surface is not bad @-@ per@@ sec@@ table ( hang@@ ers over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by re@@ dem@@ ption .
for the F@@ ish@@ bacher Wei@@ gh@@ launch project 2018 now the application of eight participants with 24 plots which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .
the re@@ furb@@ ishment area equal to 35 hectares , the low cost of low cost amounts to more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now , the White House of Tr@@ ump carries out the Statue of Liber@@ ty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to start when they start the stat@@ ues .
the Americans estimate that as any other - so the carefully organized crash of Saddam Hussein &apos;s place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the tr@@ ump regime , knew certainly what he did , when he had an sym@@ bo@@ lic axe in a heated stri@@ fe with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals for the dra@@ stic restri@@ ction of leg@@ ations with the Statue of Liber@@ ty .
to stay fair , Miller was not the statue itself .
a hor@@ des of boat owners and Liber@@ ty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators have had to have suffered him when he had done it .
but he touched their meaning , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liber@@ ty ... a symbol of American liber@@ ty , which light@@ eth the world .
the po@@ em , which you refer to that it was added later , was not part of the original Liber@@ ty Statue . &quot;
Miller is s@@ ach@@ able right , but as he form@@ ulated it , does not really see history .
it is about the contemporary res@@ on@@ ance of Lazarus , the only one , in which one state will not only spend any old immig@@ rants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your trouble , your poor , your poor , are free to bre@@ athe to bre@@ athe out of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ding waste &quot; was better to see to our screens . &quot;
Miller is not involved in literary critic@@ ism - he made clearly that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural emig@@ ration : it is indeed a conflict by the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who looked for themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew quite well that they had full @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lics , by combin@@ ing them in an un@@ used classic image representation of the female c@@ rank of liber@@ ty .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in its po@@ em the female figure no more abstr@@ act - she has received a voice .
and she himself gives herself a very different names : mother of exile .
the connection of the po@@ di@@ ment with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus has changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes of the bu@@ yer for the Comet of Tr@@ ump , arg@@ um@@ ented 2010 that the Statue of Liber@@ ty reports that the American flame burned in the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liber@@ ty goes off .
it is supposed to carry the liber@@ ty of the liber@@ ty of the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on a little bit .
the importance of the statue is quite a question of the statue of perc@@ eption .
indeed , the great hor@@ ant@@ as@@ ie@@ ous fact of Lazarus was it to see them how they had seen from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terri@@ ble travel on the deck of ships .
it is in the true sense , the world from the perspective of people to see the refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome you must hear .
and that &apos;s not the perspective , you know the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hat@@ red , who is the only source of power , is lit .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ aves Scott@@ ish members of the United Kingdom
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle rec@@ alls a time when two sh@@ all@@ ots were among the United Kingdom .
the Field director of the United Kingdom &apos;s Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ piece Scott@@ ish Kon@@ t@@ ing@@ ent will be a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scott@@ ish athl@@ ete was selected for London in 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland is something special &quot; and the Athletics of the United Kingdom to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we are trying to understand it , and we will continue until we &apos;ll need to figure , &quot; Black .
&quot; I say people at the Scott@@ ish Institute of Sports and they think that it has done something to do with what they have done .
the Scott@@ ish athletes think that it has done something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type of street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scott@@ ish athl@@ ete , medals @-@ war@@ ned , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m Route , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected to the team captain .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite mod@@ est .
her capital address was incredi@@ bly , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were p@@ ott@@ ish or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and true feeling , the Eil@@ id@@ h all of course , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ silver medal winner , which is due to compete at its fifth World Championships at 400 m Hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredi@@ bly &quot; is that 16 Sch@@ otten in the British team are .
the highest total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which was in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distances of Mu@@ ir leads on this way and placed two europe@@ an records in the past year and two European records .
it will participate at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m run@@ ners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Sch@@ otte designed to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle rec@@ alls their first World Championships , when the only other Sch@@ otte in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the rul@@ ing capital says that it is enormous proud of &quot; on the fact that many of their land@@ f@@ ancy are not only for the team , but also in some cases , also with medals and the final .
&quot; the most important part of the team has been elected in that it was elected by the other members of the team , so that it was anyway a great honour to know that my team mate is voted for me , and have chosen me something very special for me , &quot; added it .
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes get off on po@@ di@@ ums .
what is talking to my speech as a capital ?
Yes , I think it was good .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and take advantage of that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go there and to compete and it is simply as a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocks from crit@@ ics on Facebook : do not acc@@ use to a public office if you do not use the provisions of vot@@ ers .
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it took not long until the newspapers declined him because of the foreign policy up to its political principles .
he shot at the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not tell his cr@@ itic for silence .
in 1783 Washington said , &quot; The Re@@ de@@ pressing can be taken away - and , st@@ up@@ id and silent , we are led as sheep as the sheep . &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an , who need to work out more than Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have block@@ ed the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted your opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union pleaded not guilty to the beginning of this week .
the Staff of the governor left the suit as a fri@@ vol , and the online comment was full of a reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it &apos;s important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a repub@@ lican Govern@@ or in an over@@ whel@@ ming democratic state , who is amazing popular .
he has the two thr@@ ust approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
HO@@ G@@ AN is not a re@@ ac@@ ute heat head .
he has a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict dis@@ position of principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary agent to connect with his vot@@ ers and play his ha@@ ar@@ less head to chemotherapy on its side .
therefore , the block of persons that come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially , and of employees who are paid by public tax @-@ dollar - un@@ necessary and finally end@@ ang@@ ered .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ended Ho@@ gan@@ s Sp@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse on the actions of the governor and arg@@ um@@ ented that the block@@ age of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s easy to use the image of TRO@@ LL@@ ING or don@@ ations or h@@ ash @-@ filled people to use the whi@@ p online .
the post said with some of the real people who were block@@ ed by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a busin@@ ess@@ man and a past@@ or , no condens@@ ation .
they all told , that their comments is respec@@ t@@ ful , and not prof@@ an@@ ed .
the priest c@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled on Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bow@@ ie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ essed , but she asked to hate hat@@ red .
&quot; I comm@@ ented , that I was dis@@ appointed , that there was no reaction to hate hat@@ ching and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comments &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I guess these idea also not when a number of people on the same subject position , then they will be used by some more than a so @-@ called collective use , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the staff of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated sp@@ am attack , &quot; would probably call us &quot; Für@@ e &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cutting a message by simply block@@ ed a cr@@ itic or a negative comment .
it &apos;s much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect newspapers with critical conductivity and demonstration , or demonstr@@ ators and to silence .
but exactly what &apos;s just happens .
HO@@ G@@ AN is not the first public officials that critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is denied by Twitter users that block@@ ed by his Twitter fe@@ eds .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County dis@@ missed the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , as they knew a vot@@ ers of their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Govern@@ or Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers were promising in 1776 and 1800 , and anon@@ ymous let@@ ter@@ ers rep@@ lied on his leadership .
and even at that time , Washington had an anon@@ ymous con@@ figure .
the people who used pseud@@ on@@ ym@@ s like &quot; Ju@@ ri@@ cola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions made .
pet@@ itions that gained its position on the contract of Am@@ ity , commerce and shipping with great Britain critic@@ ized the office , according to the historic documents that were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put it to silence .
freedom of freedom , differences and dis@@ courses are part of our nation &apos;s foundation .
and the true command means that we accept .

less lung cancer by pas@@ siv@@ ity smoking
over the past two decades , less people have died of lung cancer in the past two decades .
as a result , researchers at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , these estimates are 167 lung cancer accid@@ ents on pas@@ siv@@ ity , &quot; said the Hei@@ ko mu@@ g .
in comparison , he moved with his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there were 400 lung cancer accid@@ ents because of pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove themselves as a very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ ing@@ street are in full swing and &quot; lie in the period , &quot; so the leader of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house connections be the location comp@@ lic@@ ated as susp@@ ected as in the under@@ way much ver@@ sely , what is not in the plans .
the traffic , which is always equipped for the construction work , represents a big problem for the B@@ aut@@ ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ anz of motor@@ bik@@ ers in front of red lights and shut @-@ off , is already enormous , &quot; reported Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the liner buses are allowed to go through .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z by the company St@@ ump@@ p are working on the bridge since weeks .
&quot; the hot days were very beautiful .
but fortunately we have looked after our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and Death in Indones@@ ian Gol@@ dland
if B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is cooked , use no stove .
they even uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regime in the un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the ho@@ use@@ wife usually makes a sweet potato - loc@@ ally as &quot; N@@ ota &quot; - right in the fireplace .
after half an hour the wi@@ do@@ ck dum@@ bbells with ei@@ fri@@ es , un@@ washed hands are taken and sw@@ allowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ ft of clay - it has no furniture - where it leads their daily work , such as dresses by wash water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as Lat@@ rine .
the youngest of their hus@@ bands were not assigned to their fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is usual here .
of course you can work too dangerous : most vill@@ agers are un@@ employed , and many drank , and there are here the soldiers .
&quot; no one should go , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it .
it is a rare in@@ sight into the daily life in the Hochland von Pap@@ ua , a former d@@ utch referendum in 1969 , when only 1,0@@ 26 el@@ dest through a public collection before the occup@@ ying troops to vote .
an existing movement that raised to independence against the Dutch rule , turned out fast against the government of Jak@@ arta to take control over the region and foreign journalists or legal ob@@ serv@@ atory .
in 2003 , the province officially split in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea was the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so located as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ y 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transportation .
the city with approximately 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo tables , and from corrugated walls , which were converted by r@@ ust into different yellow @-@ f@@ owl .
only very few of Indonesia have made her trip to come here , look for journalists and practi@@ cally no fore@@ ign@@ ers .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not we@@ ed to bear this clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and indicates her liv@@ ely , hand@@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and their bright rock .
&quot; we had only had leaves at our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indones@@ ian province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality rate in Asia .
but it is also Indones@@ ian Gol@@ dland .
the biggest and most profit@@ able gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country province in the size of New Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has been built in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a valu@@ ed amounts of 78 billion US dollars in the estimated value of an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these ri@@ chn@@ ess are a source of el@@ est@@ ies for the Pap@@ ua , to ensure that Indones@@ ian colon@@ ies that Indones@@ ian military has preserved an initial presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local mil@@ itar@@ ists and units sold almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ vian demands of larger aut@@ onomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are mer@@ cil@@ ess .
according to activ@@ ists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands were rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military , tort@@ ured and imprisoned .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe er@@ up@@ ward in 1970 @-@ s were alleged to commit genocide by the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , Indian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 pe@@ ac@@ efully demonstr@@ ators in the region .
&quot; we wor@@ ld@@ ly prove it in a report by the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports about Gr@@ äu@@ ble did the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - r@@ ape and electro@@ des are particularly popular - and the brut@@ al pre@@ cip@@ itation of peaceful demonstr@@ ations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week is going to pass , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia resear@@ cher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a refuge from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the dem@@ ographic development has changed since Muslim economic mig@@ rants from the be@@ aten islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ ons sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , served mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting for here .
&quot; the mig@@ rants began to sell ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market che@@ aper than the local Pap@@ ua , declared A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ secret , who moved to the provin@@ cial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mo@@ m Mo@@ m &#91; the female &#93; of Pap@@ ua - its market . &quot;
the Indones@@ ian president of J@@ oko Wid@@ odo , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , said during his election campaign in 2014 , the in@@ equ@@ alities and the legal men@@ tions in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann saf@@ te 27 of the total 29 distri@@ cts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the myst@@ ic dec@@ eit@@ s feel .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we have voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will ful@@ fill our hope , &quot; says You . &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai actually suffered two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 there was a group of 11 children without and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , served as two Indian soldiers on a motorbike by the darkness .
the troubled children told them that they should put their flo@@ odlight on them .
one of the soldiers participated in their tone and came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , pursu@@ ed and sm@@ ote the group with their guns , they said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers killed in the group of children .
a child , the 16 year old Yu@@ li@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to sm@@ itten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government Commission was set on fire and the things of the next day .
approximately 1,000 young par@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch before the local police station and the military comm@@ and@@ o@@ Center to demand justice .
they contributed zer@@ den@@ ial hunting bows and conducted the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle ongoing and a bird wat@@ ched - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk .
some protest@@ ers started stones on police and military demand .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldier was sent over an internal Funk : &quot; if the mass@@ es had more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; called it in an official document of TIME , which was not released in an official document of TIME , which was not released the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening danger and called for peace and called the amount of home to home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I was shot in my left hand in my left hand , &quot; he said the TIME in the por@@ ch of his color@@ ful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame knows not yet , who fe@@ ared , but says that the ball from the ranks were gathered here together .
&quot; it was filled with many shots , &quot; added to it . &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his co@@ usin , the witness of the revi@@ val .
&quot; I came to him , and sought his body to go safe that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries many Indones@@ ian only a name , the TIME in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I did with him . &quot;
the Chief spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ orters that his officers didn &apos;t want to secure their destination , because they will be attacked .
&quot; we need to def@@ end ourselves when people threatened to kill us , &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Comm@@ ission@@ er P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and injured .
the messages about the k@@ ill@@ ings were only filtered on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; after Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a pas@@ sion@@ ate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura a pas@@ sion@@ ate speech in which he sold sym@@ pat@@ hi@@ ps for families of the victims and sw@@ are to t@@ ack@@ le the historical ab@@ ut@@ ors in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I would like to solve this case , so it will not happen anymore in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
President Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , in October 2016 , he established a exceptional mechan@@ isms to establish historical human rights viol@@ ations .
but the talk started almost immediately .
&quot; most inju@@ ries occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the early 2000 @-@ year @-@ old .
the point is that we are ob@@ li@@ ged to be committed to us these mut@@ ations , but there are processes that are through , &quot; he said . &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto made a withdraw@@ al when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIME , saying , He has no plans to establish a compl@@ aint Mechan@@ ism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is leg@@ ally controlled , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , accused the UN because of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor &apos;s independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights viol@@ ations in Pap@@ ua was already laid in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Vic@@ tims took such claims to un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no adv@@ ances , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that he still lives in an@@ xi@@ ety years later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have been afraid to be arrested by the military , and fe@@ ars to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai is afraid to discuss the incid@@ ent .
he says that he was be@@ aten by the military , after he helped to buried four of the victims .
&quot; after I had been buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; says he .
the shooting is not included .
on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police in the village of Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between the vill@@ agers and the Manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring an un@@ consci@@ ous man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Rav@@ ian@@ us Dou@@ w , which was dr@@ unk in a nearby river , died on the way into the hospital .
the village of vill@@ agers are Protest@@ ant before the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers in@@ sist@@ ed on officers , which re@@ acted to them by war@@ nings .
but secret that the mobile Brigade ( Indones@@ ian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began on the crowd and killed a f@@ atal .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that it is ven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives in the vicinity of the hospital , and witness , as the last here is fast , so the TIME .
&quot; I am hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to move the participating officers to move into account and to with@@ draw the camp@@ ers of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ dent for the Indones@@ ian government .
lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the ancest@@ ral tribunal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( OP@@ M ) , the re@@ bel Army army that claims to def@@ end the rights of the Pap@@ ua , by using spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and demonstr@@ ations of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top OP@@ M leaders comes from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ a .
in response to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai was arrested and ar@@ bit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custody for the last years , under the presence of the national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some diving will never be back .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a trag@@ ic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for secret too expensive .
bread is the same except range .
people get everything that they eat : especially N@@ ota and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to work in four or five fields of sweet potato @-@ pot@@ ato@@ e .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces N@@ ota cost only 10,000 ind@@ on@@ ese ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
during the time , economic un@@ equ@@ ations grew between the native Pap@@ ua and the new mig@@ rants who have arrived at the name of new flight from the Nab@@ ire airport in larger number .
the few jobs that exists in the region go to the better educ@@ ated and we@@ alth@@ y mig@@ rants .
Pap@@ ua have rare the capital or the necessary skills to perform their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chair of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restri@@ ctions remain covered by international media coverage .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ champ were dep@@ orted to the coordin@@ ation with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission granted to them .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ ow@@ is constitu@@ tions , the limit@@ ations of the reporting currency to promote transpar@@ ency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new services for foreign journalists , trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ tranqu@@ ill@@ ful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : Visa gift , and a black list , said he in a declaration .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on Indones@@ ian government is largely limited to the immediate neigh@@ bour of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six p@@ az@@ if@@ i@@ onic States - T@@ onga , N@@ aur@@ u , Pal@@ au , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investig@@ ate the &quot; various and widespread inju@@ ries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have been histor@@ ically seen the OP@@ M .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir , showed a dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally and told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally system , and there is free media that it is difficult to distri@@ bute the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on site want to assume that more foreign governments should take this knowledge .
when a official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights , Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , visited her silence and marked him &quot; We want to participate in the meeting , but anon@@ ymous , but anon@@ ymous .
in 2019 , in 2019 , a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua will say that they probably will probably agree to Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but it is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ üssen , &quot; says g@@ ob@@ ai the Chief of the Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from it , that it lives under the permanent threat of a r@@ ushing military , in arm@@ our refresh@@ ments and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; consider that he must pay .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness . &quot;
despite the thre@@ ats and en@@ abling families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ers , a recent sym@@ bo@@ lic figure of Trotsky : the bodies of a victims was buried on a grounds across the police and the military station .
they may know that they may never be forgotten about justice , but at least they don &apos;t leave their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire catch the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ zer from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential doors in Dubai , its break@@ book and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from 337 metres high , 79 @-@ storey buildings .
it is the second fire that led in just two years due to the high @-@ house , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , inju@@ ries were reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we sle@@ pt and we are heated by the cre@@ atures and at the cry of the people .
we are down the steps down , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; counted a resident who named his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais Civil Protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and the buildings .
the government said , I have been working on the provision of announc@@ ements for the affected people .
the incid@@ ent can be used for safety of materials that will be used in outdoor areas of high @-@ homes on all over the world .
an investigation conducted by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from the covering , covering decoration or isolation , came .
in Britain , the police said that the system of panels for ins@@ ulating and covering at the London Gren@@ elle Tower in June to the rapid spread of a fire which died around 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis network ( IT@@ F ) is fallen by his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p in the General Assembly .
during the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , he was also supported for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only to two prize packages , b@@ ill @-@ thin not by the required two @-@ third majority .
so often very long , but also this is therefore very appreci@@ ated five @-@ sentence classi@@ cs remain so far to the traditions .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the countries agree to the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just missed out .
&quot; we respect the decision , but are dis@@ appointed that our members are not the whole re@@ form@@ ations for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this ic@@ onic and historic compet@@ itions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
one will continue to improve the purch@@ ases .
not only for the vote , even after many things , before the suggest@@ ion before the final , the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be right in the first round the host right .
to reduce the cost of promot@@ ions , the requirements in terms of training places , etc . facil@@ it@@ ates the players will need less official media events prior to the Davis Cup .
more than 1 from 5 U.S. tour pro@@ hib@@ ited items into air@@ plane , takes a survey
a survey conducted under flight MH17 revealed that more than 20 percent , or un@@ consci@@ ously b@@ anned items in the control score of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which betra@@ yed the plane , while they accid@@ ent@@ ally hib@@ ited kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they could have been del@@ ayed that they are just@@ ified with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey conducted by more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also determined that the younger trav@@ ellers may be ob@@ sol@@ ete .
of the respon@@ dents , the enco@@ res that they have been pro@@ hib@@ ited to fly with anything that was forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with fewer than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common objects that were used to T@@ SA agent , were food and liqu@@ ids .
more than 3 percent stated that objects were carried by security control through the security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents , and 3.7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed have also confirmed that they were explic@@ it@@ ly forbidden drugs into the aircraft .
the company said , asking for travel@@ ed trav@@ ellers throughout the country to find out how many accid@@ ent@@ ally used sm@@ ug@@ hs through the airport security and how many of it did .
it is no surprise that people who are the most stri@@ king lubric@@ ate - certain@@ ty or in@@ feed - by security , those who were most frequently fly .
the company also shows that the T@@ SA direc@@ tives is a little comp@@ lic@@ ated and conf@@ used .
people are often un@@ certain that they may take advantage of flu@@ ids , or how much of them .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of objects from T@@ SA ann@@ ex@@ ed liqu@@ ids are b@@ anned liqu@@ ids .
for a time long thought people , the T@@ SA could view books as a sm@@ ug@@ hs .
liqu@@ ids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : ten thousands of Tes@@ la customers canc@@ el order
Elektro @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has so far under@@ strike that part of the customers have with@@ drawn their un@@ binding reservation again .
in addition to its always tri@@ umph@@ al numbers , Tes@@ la b@@ oss El@@ on Mus@@ k made a different , less smooth number : the cancell@@ ations made in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k had the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose ex@@ tradition begins .
now , Mus@@ k has been sp@@ ati@@ fied : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 had already been with@@ drawn .
cr@@ itic were always pointed out again , that it is only for non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay 1000 US dollars ( US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
currently there are 45@@ 5,000 such un@@ binding reservations in a telephone conference with an@@ alyst@@ s .
however , the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be solved , however , the Tes@@ la leader is not b@@ oss .
his argument , the challenge at the ambitious growth is not for demand , but on the production page .
last year Tes@@ la 84@@ .000 vehicles delivered in the past year .
2018 - all models together - 500.000 will be one million .
the demand for this is evi@@ dent .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently about 1800 reservations per day .
who today is appointed a &quot; model 3 &quot; can be reck@@ on in the second half of 2018 with the ex@@ tradition - when Tes@@ la it creates , its brand new , never even in the practice tested production roads without a maximum load of load .
many experts dou@@ b@@ ts that this is possible .
however , it comes to greater delay , then could the integr@@ ity of reservations for Tes@@ la will become a problem .
then , the company can not satis@@ fy the company un@@ satis@@ fying customers in swe@@ ars .
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reducing the rules of the Obama Er@@ a rules for reducing emissions
one day after he had promised by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of environmental protection authority , his former decision returned to reducing the implementation of Obama &apos;s era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g CO2 emissions .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency has proved to re@@ alize the needs of the state @-@ government agencies due to re@@ ak@@ eholder faster than previous administration .
he didn &apos;t mention the compl@@ aint against his previous verdict in a federal court .
it &apos;s a time limit which ran on 1 October for States to hold the standards of the number of o@@ zone by 2015 .
p@@ ru@@ ction announced in June that he had to w@@ ound up a year to study his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid having in local decisions , or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was long time a reliable enemy &apos;s environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeat@@ edly gone to block regul@@ atory or del@@ ayed the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the su@@ dden transition from Wednesday is the most recent legal return for the P@@ ru@@ ff standard rolling agenda .
last month , a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA must have sur@@ passed its authority as he tried to use the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks to del@@ ayed .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ sted published the preparation of o@@ zone with o@@ zone standards , remin@@ ded the read@@ iness of the EPA to cooperation with the complex process of legal proceedings of the new standards .
&quot; under earlier administration , the EPA often did not carry out the dead@@ lines for carrying out , and then to be serv@@ iced by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a do@@ zen times in his previous job .
&quot; we don &apos;t believe in a regulation by j@@ uris@@ diction , and we are serious .
we also take the law and authority , which gives us to us . &quot;
nevertheless , the position of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt somet@@ ime reports his &quot; respect for del@@ ayed and all other leg@@ ally available to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress takes place on a comprehensive re@@ membr@@ ance of the o@@ zone rules .
one of the last month of the per@@ mits bill , the implementation of the rules of 2015 are del@@ ayed by at least eight years .
the measure was not included in the Senate .
in the New York General Att@@ orney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the co@@ alition of the States , which had promised the EPA in this week , said the Group inten@@ tional to ren@@ ew the stat@@ ut@@ ory print .
&quot; the return of the EPA - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New York , which are affected directly from smo@@ g , who flows into their communities within their communities . &quot;
new York decided in this case California , Conn@@ ecti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Min@@ nes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penns@@ yl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground o@@ zone is ar@@ ises , if poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refined series , chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere to sun@@ light .
the amount of smo@@ g may cause smo@@ ky groups of people serious breathing problems , and every year a thousand of premature death cases contri@@ bute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health and environmental prot@@ ests over P@@ ru@@ ff sur@@ prising changes .
&quot; it is wor@@ r@@ ying how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air which we bre@@ athe in , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological land@@ mark of the tr@@ ump government , claim@@ ing activities and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ our on Sunday , July 16 to 4.30 p.m. on a Ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether his idyl@@ lic position and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade visitors can be del@@ ayed from this powerful place .
the rescue and preserv@@ ation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and spon@@ s@@ ors of tum@@ our .
Walter Martini emphas@@ ized : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ ing f@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned in the Wür@@ ttem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ kunden@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain to the Indian Church of Tum@@ our and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eberhard of H@@ orb and to his brother Dietrich of 20 Mark silver .
according to the word of the document , on the Tum@@ linger Mountain except of the former parish church , a magnificent farm , belonged to the church or pat@@ ron Law , and not vice vers@@ a .
so there are also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 1858 , next to the under@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are currently even to recognize today in the town of tum@@ our , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the glori@@ ous sett@@ lers of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 enter@@ tain@@ ing these historical names .
the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht originated from the early medieval egg law .
one Lord , who built a church , took place , and ended with a past@@ or , remained in the owner of this church , and was also inher@@ ited this owner &apos;s Church .
this was related to the right to use a priest or the Bishop a new priest .

until 1869 , the tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius gra@@ vey@@ ard served as the last rest@@ ing place for the dead from the dead bodies .
in 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower left .
in the New Year 1834 , a storm broke the storm of the storm and half of the storm .
to prevent an evil , the tower was broken .

Association wants to exam@@ ine permission from wind turbines .
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim def@@ en@@ eth himself &quot; sees no legal pre@@ condition for building and has been applied to the country .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is rejected &quot; by Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) , its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
she was right .
the association arg@@ uments that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ eries N@@ ette , no wind turbines could be approved , since at the time there is merely a wind power concentration in Schw@@ alm@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone is a excl@@ usion of wind energy use for the rest area .
zones are to prevent a &quot; for@@ get@@ ed &quot; of the landscape .
the town of Four had few days earlier by a change of the surface protection zone in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the District government was not approved , because of a form@@ ulation .
&quot; by the lack of planning permission , the approved approval decision according to the right of the right and therefore , Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , President of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim are def@@ en@@ ched . &quot;
the current state of things : the town council before the summer break again decided the wind concentration zone in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval of the District government is still standing .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; this point is to be excluded from a approval for the establishment of wind energy systems .
the circle confirmed the recei@@ pt of the collection .
&quot; the respective writ@@ ings have passed since VER@@ GAN@@ GEN@@ ER week in the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; explained a spokes@@ person .
the circle takes you to the occasion , the matter of the matter .
however , they don &apos;t expect that the procedure is stopped .
with a look at the process of administration at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday is not responsible for the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim def@@ aul@@ ts . &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ eries N@@ ette , construction of four , 200 metres high wind turbines .
over the past year , the company took part in the town of Vier@@ sen , P@@ acht@@ promises with the owners of about 65 hectares of large off @-@ off .
with the establishment of the four wind power plants , the power requirement of approximately 11 400 households can be covered - equivalent to approximately one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four sen@@ iors .
the NEW re will invest some 20 million euros .
in the last summer there were new city council for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ P@@ alen@@ berg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .

tr@@ ump placed after the qu@@ ett@@ led tran@@ scrip@@ ts from telephone , Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the bound@@ ary
calls from telephone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and management of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on the 27th of January , Tr@@ ump called En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on January 27th , called En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on which he would not pay for a planned limit wall .
the U.S. President received him , because he had publicly addressed the wall , he said to him , &quot; This can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
tr@@ ump launched his presidential campaign in speaking with the promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ or , Mexico for the project .
the tran@@ scrip@@ ts of his first an@@ ru@@ fs with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and pul@@ led an over@@ heated exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Tr@@ ench@@ man said that a trade for the U.S. refugees , which led to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; st@@ up@@ id , &quot; it would like to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban to res@@ ett@@ lement in the US .

Mo@@ ores Ford Mass@@ acre : activ@@ ists perform rac@@ ial Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mercury drove through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and r@@ ump@@ ed to the Ford Bridge by Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came forward to block its way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man sized age in a needle @-@ cut suit - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked round through the wind@@ screen .
inside the st@@ ressed in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; Br@@ ing the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
the silence , when a young black man was torn down from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terri@@ ble scene was played on July 22 , only one supplement .
but if then a Sch@@ lings for the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown out , almost all of them in the audience are very genuine S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
since 2005 civil law@@ yers come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , around the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has been indicted because of the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it is really unusual that in all these years , not only one person is arrested , although we know them in our municip@@ alities , although we know who are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks which helps in the organization of the delivery .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 year old former con@@ g@@ ress@@ ors of the state Georgia and a life for civil rights .
for him who serves as a dram@@ atic call to handle and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community , that a lack of iniquity was correc@@ ted .
&quot; we want to pro@@ secution , we want to re@@ conc@@ iliation , we want to re@@ conc@@ iliation , but first we must get righteousness . &quot; he said .
&quot; we can not get to healing and re@@ conc@@ iliation , until we will receive righteousness . &quot;
a j@@ uris@@ diction over the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI file , which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men of Monroe and the surrounding graphics have been susp@@ ected .
but none was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on free feet since decades , citi@@ zen@@ ship will say that the double @-@ motiv@@ ation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court ren@@ dered the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , in the summer they played their voice in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI &apos;s black col@@ ou@@ cher Roger Mal@@ com , a white base owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly infr@@ ing@@ ing a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that Ger@@ sho@@ ots had been in the city that H@@ ester had sle@@ pt with mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and did the baby , which she had died , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a promin@@ ent white land owner , 600 dollars to get Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Co@@ us@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when she turned away from prison , then the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge desc@@ ended , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b car .
&quot; as it represents , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared the Mor@@ de and arranged , &quot; includes a F@@ BI report .
&quot; it is evi@@ dent that there was a con@@ spir@@ acy between state and local pro@@ secution that was not only involved in the mur@@ ders , elim@@ inated and elim@@ inate the identity of witnesses . &quot;
bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more pre@@ gn@@ ant .
&quot; it was a right of the right massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed to send message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register , and if you vote , you will happen here . &quot;
for almost a decade of Cass@@ andra , Cass@@ andra has led the annual issue of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
its representation is depic@@ ted , str@@ apping and is just@@ ified in a kind of deep rit@@ ism , who would like to believe that he does not exist in America in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and yet more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to speak about the Lyn@@ ne , because we &apos;re talking to all con@@ fron@@ ts in us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build it any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or hear what I have done . &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a do@@ zen white and the rest black - in a room and loud as gre@@ ene a well @-@ looking overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ens Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief musician member since years , but he said , the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dir@@ ty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story on life because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room proven the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester , and starts it , was angry that he has sle@@ pt with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- He sent away from my property ! &quot;
grass tri@@ cks the fire .
there is a break .
and then every ( at least all black actor ) in laugh@@ ter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the loud voice .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; he asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ arm@@ oured and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said Gre@@ ene , still delicious .
&quot; I don &apos;t believe that white people then &apos; n --- &apos; said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ch one of the other black int@@ actors .
&quot; you must meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
and it is due to move the energy in space , a feeling of camera case replaced the accident .
everyone is thus bus@@ y , but not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts once again .
this time , if Ras@@ hid the N word says he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this rep@@ et@@ ition ends and quickly .
there are Schre@@ ie , shots and then silence .
a woman , cloth@@ ed with a grape @-@ dress , stands on the bodies of actors and leads to the suffering from the Lo@@ bre@@ de Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind , a group of about four do@@ zen spect@@ ators swe@@ ars and te@@ ars out of the eyes .
the audience is split almost even@@ ly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , just to see the performance , many come down the road .
they have experienced an almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Bro@@ oks she leads on a pilgri@@ m@@ age to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de is left a An@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you found on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de felt that the air felt spread .
if the last notes of songs live out , Gre@@ ene invites the quantity to come to come and inspec@@ ting the body &apos;s body .
children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the counter@@ feit blood and the silent body to each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy when he shall remember it .
after some minutes , Gre@@ ene the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actor throw the Lyn@@ sk@@ eil road and form their te@@ ars .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , which has played a member member .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ eth two of his fellow players , then breaks down in their arms , the emot@@ ional burden of performance breaks out in him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; there is one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this from a reason . &quot;
later , the audience with the actors to dinner together .
at a table , a white pair made from Atlanta is exc@@ ited about the completion of a black pair which they have straight out .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski cont@@ ested to find words , which feel the performance of the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear that terri@@ ble words and acts to hear ... from people who look like yourself and they that do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really do with me , it leaves me that the Lyn@@ ch can still go on , &quot; added it , &quot; today it is called police shooting game . &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof holds his table , he re@@ e@@ ats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said , he already began to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the follow @-@ up is inspired by a way , because it describes the fear of what we have to bear , but there &apos;s also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s so if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not have his own story , who does not know his own story , is sentenced to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ t@@ ter@@ däm@@ m@@ erung &quot; conc@@ iled to the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ um@@ ental factory , director Frank Cast@@ orf sets a color@@ ful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of gig@@ antic , six @-@ storey scenes .
the rotation stage ( designed by Ale@@ k@@ san@@ dar Den@@ ic ) shows an additional street corner with mas@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR and the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , a open Mercedes @-@ old@@ timer , in which the Rhine k@@ ills as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil t@@ ank@@ ers remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ mot@@ iv - money , power and go@@ ier - which is moving through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ fool@@ ish - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ised as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
the K@@ ess promises them Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , err@@ s in Hollywood man@@ ier a rental in the boot and give the tie Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing s@@ ings the glori@@ ous fi@@ ese Hagen , which gives the A@@ ura of a heavy duty box@@ er box@@ er .
brut@@ al the scene , when he pro@@ poses Siegfried .
later I have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with strong Applause .
stor@@ my celebrated f@@ oster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who formed himself and bow@@ ed his hands to the Merkel duo .
great fall is for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure wear .
the appearance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Reg@@ i@@ et@@ eam .
in 2013 , he had to rise another cell concert in 2013 , there were five years later , there were five years later , in which the settled &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went missing .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to talk about it .
&quot; one think that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in certain way , &quot; she had spoken shortly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also a understanding of his vis@@ ibility .
I go a positive res@@ ume Army .
max. quantity works as volunte@@ er
they work in their volunteers at several locations in their volunteers .

one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , he would have a living space - approximately 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with a 70 square meters surface area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council deci@@ des , such a common room is not just as meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ us@@ al living room , but open to the community .
as an example , the word made by &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; in turn .
finally , the decision made by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget already decided in the last autumn , by funding possible .
construction is in the san@@ itation area .
the establishment of a common office would be , so called T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent promot@@ es .
the decision to sign@@ alize the invest@@ or that you will not throw him in this regard to the legs , that the seat is reduced - as well as p@@ ult@@ s@@ roof - what the trend @-@ height is reduced and the construction of economic power - that would be possible .
un@@ necessary , not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer is this supplement .
if it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously he happens the panel .
not as simple as it is common .
Daniela Call refers to the many of their own building , with which one can &apos;t be right in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do so do so . &quot;
Yv@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks to the common room - but absolutely against a commun@@ al participation .
it looks behind a con@@ ce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y of ohn@@ pei or bad investors .
this is not that , because with the acquisition of the surface , you do not have access , but will get a real , in the bi@@ fel@@ ine @-@ market value , is the subject speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers Requ@@ est , the decision to be mounted according to the decision , there will be three fe@@ ars .
so , in two counter@@ parts of the original program , Stefan H@@ aller so sum@@ mar@@ izes : &quot; if we concl@@ ude the order , we make a giant step , a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

from Star to Star , hiking
the federal government is due to be launched in the resin .
this plant plans to Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet has been held in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; Star@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; come to meet the information need@@ y from many Har@@ rison .
he connect nature , science , movement and sport@@ y performance .
the members want to arrange along the planned route boards and provide information about stars and star images .
in the first phase up to 2018 the club plans &quot; well @-@ achie@@ vable installations to five to six places &quot; in the Ober@@ harz .
in@@ question Rid@@ ing St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are to be completed by Internet .
therefore in the site selection a good mobile network reception can be played .
even Acc@@ essi@@ bility was a crit@@ eri@@ on .
the star train station should be expanded by train .
&quot; on the con@@ stellation &quot; viewing a lot of knowledge , for example , about the physi@@ cs of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learn why stars have different colors or why a star stronger light is stronger than another , even though it is considerably removed .
also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star , and when he was best to see .
since 2014 the association has been operating at the top of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg as the highest star in Northern Germany since 2014 .
the location in the middle of the national park , counts according to the Federal Office of Natural Protection for the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there are the milk road and even the And@@ rom@@ eda galax@@ y with the naked eye can clearly see clearly .
in the University @-@ Stadt , there has been an initiative of Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen , something similar to the planned con@@ stellation - plan@@ etary ne@@ eding countries since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the plan@@ etary wal@@ k@@ way leads up to Hain@@ berg and to the Stern@@ war@@ te - as well as an &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municip@@ ality ) with the plan@@ ets of Sed@@ na .
the plan@@ ks with the individual plan@@ ets - including the d@@ warf plan@@ atory Pl@@ uto at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ unt is on a ball of 6,5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while exactly 75 meters away the sun is 70 centi@@ meters away .
the entire distance of the planet is good four kilometers .
during the light from Sun to the pl@@ uto , about eight hours you need a pe@@ de@@ strian hours to St@@ ele with Pl@@ uto .
pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the world .
but the march to the next fixed star would last another half year .

four t@@ ilt to tire plat@@ ter
during an accident at the A7 , four people were seri@@ ously injured .
after first information , the driver of a Opel Zaf@@ ira lost the control of a Opel Zaf@@ ira , shortly before the junction of market , probably after a tire @-@ plated control over his vehicle .

the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children were seri@@ ously injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the last through the rescue service , A7 towards north for approximately one hour was locked , then the traffic could be carried forward to the left hand on the left .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ ier@@ chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hop@@ ing for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener to Br@@ uns@@ wick that the optimi@@ zation of the def@@ aul@@ ting formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season play Andre Hoffmann is satisfied , with the result , there were not the two counter@@ ore at 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; these were two opp@@ onents to much , and we must not fit in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebir@@ ge , the tri@@ cycle chain is also further optimized .
and a gate after a fre@@ ak track we don &apos;t want to start anymore .
&quot; for the future it will be so that there is no more next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is also right after the experiences in preparation with the three chain , than with the four chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know how we will be in Au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer Fried@@ helm Radio , but Hoffmann is sure to make sure what we can build in the three @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ elmann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; the pre@@ condition is , but that we are still more harmon@@ ious and we did not make us a lot of game error . &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; whether you speak according to a dis@@ miss@@ ile start , I don &apos;t know .
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; meant Hoffmann .
&quot; if we focus on Sunday with four points and can focus on the cup , we will certainly speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
it wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start into the season I only split up after six to eight players , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el said the game of a advantage against Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled due to a mis@@ et@@ ters .
&quot; now they can start the season qu@@ asi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that players from Au@@ e may perhaps even be something fresh , because they have no heav@@ ier and complete game like Fort@@ una against an up@@ level fav@@ or@@ ites in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; says the def@@ ending of Fort@@ una .
although guests came from the Rhin@@ eland as a little favorite on Sunday to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we are dis@@ posable , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ ness , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is a positive effect against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to strike by vor@@ n@@ her@@ ein , &quot; explained in Ch@@ ef@@ coach .
&quot; one such statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and overcome . &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el wants to see his player on Sunday .
new Results of the Swedish As@@ yl@@ alter @-@ evaluation tests
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , show a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ic medicine ( hard @-@ medic@@ inal medic@@ inal ) has started testing the tests last year .
they are supposed to be more specific during the asylum procedures , after the Swedish mig@@ rant authority ( migration mark ) because of errors of the correct age of some refugees , which had been critical .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ enc@@ et send 6,@@ 880 to test@@ ify cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the time from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were ass@@ essed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency said that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are only carried out in cases , where the age of the person is placed in question .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to the last months .
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the last months , the figures are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been judged more than 18 years , does not necess@@ arily know that the asylum seek@@ ers have been lu@@ ves at its age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there is 442 cases , the &quot; pro@@ pose that the subject was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det made the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases had predicted the person that they will be 18 years old .
the method of medical cer@@ emon@@ ies , in order to be taken from scrat@@ ching and MR@@ I recording of buttons , which are analyzed by dent@@ ist and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ized in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ ocr@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska @-@ Institute which enc@@ om@@ passes the assessment of biological irrit@@ ation of people to see if they were earlier or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age to ass@@ ess this way is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could do , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of child is un@@ true , low as adults is un@@ true .
the biggest risk is in this case , when the person is below 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
working on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Schr@@ am@@ berg are going well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern local entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , buil@@ der at the department of road and traffic in the Reg@@ ulations of Freiburg .
in April , the work started at all three san@@ itation bridges between Schr@@ am@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction is scheduled for October and is sure that the ti@@ met@@ able is stopped .
the first bridge , coming from Schr@@ am@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge of concrete , which is cloth@@ ed with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein , and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other bridges , it has come now to the years .
to ensure the resistance and transport security , three buildings are thorough@@ ly renovated .
the two other bridges perform over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were constructed in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ mentioned bridges .
this is a Rand@@ om , which is used as operating road .
at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.20 metre wide bridge unit will be used .
then the pe@@ de@@ strian path should then be lost .
the particular point is that it is about prefabricated elements , a patent of Schr@@ am@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special rock @-@ coat h@@ opes has it required by the works of the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre be@@ et@@ able to which many companies are connected .
the vill@@ agers were informed of the work by hand over the previous year .
moreover , F@@ ishes and Kre@@ b@@ se had to be done .
for the bridges between the building buildings and the sc@@ rap@@ ers in the direction of Schr@@ am@@ berg the traffic noise is regul@@ ated through a traffic light .
for the construction work at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher city entrance , the road is closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the costs for the three bridges amounts to 700 000 euros .
it is fin@@ anced by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
it &apos;s not so common that parties go on a strand , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring to a hat .
the parties of the parties of the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , FW@@ G , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a wide alliance in this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ delle is the &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and familiar name to the launch - as Alice Wei@@ den , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the top @-@ duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the dep@@ uty president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already at the beginning of the event in front of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D list@@ eners .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains multi@@ coloured . &quot;
originally the town @-@ Pick@@ n@@ ick was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the ground place , but it is now located on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells , and thus directly from the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a color@@ ful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Ch@@ air@@ woman of the For@@ ums One World and one of the decisive organiz@@ ers , right is pleased : &quot; great how many people come together here . &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , among them a &quot; ur@@ red potato salad , which could easily eat the Af@@ r , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
the police suffered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence of presence in especially at the railway station , which is just a few metres from the locations .
how is the Af@@ D actually came in Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D vol@@ can@@ oes reports that he tried to make an such event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there &apos;s a cancellation because because of the early Laur@@ enti@@ us kir@@ ch not enough parking available .
so now the Ron@@ delle , Hom@@ pes will rejoice that &quot; we can have a beautiful event here . &quot;
with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ es@@ platz : &quot; this is the good right of people , main matter , it remains peaceful . &quot;
it also does it : around 20 o &apos;clock , a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various Red@@ ner , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ ical Af@@ D @-@ Ch@@ air@@ woman Uwe Junge .
in the hall , there are approximately 200 list@@ eners , waiting for that the top tier date for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
unchanged , the police presence , but so far the officials announced a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour , the Af@@ D event takes place on the court , but also there is a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can go - no special incid@@ ents .

this is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ rom@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both combines the l@@ ust , not only the limits on their instruments , but also the bound@@ aries of the different gen@@ res .

this core element of the program was first premier@@ ed by ri@@ esi@@ as success in Freiburg .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love the gr@@ illed cheese , and they will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I would like to try all , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart completely open to her Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
&quot; if I think once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool what comes as a neigh@@ bour ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ stars was one of her &quot; Tw@@ il@@ ight &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ulti@@ mat@@ ely the last bitter .
in spite of the in@@ sured the brun@@ ette of the brun@@ ette , opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Grand Bazaar &quot; -@@ magazine : &quot; I was in any serious , whom I have changed .
or believe you about , I would have played it ? &quot;
after the separation gave the crime that she was bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ell : &quot; I have ever lived the du@@ alism already and believe it .
so it never has never conf@@ used or disabled me .
I never lik@@ ed it , not serious , too . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; but in the school time they rather than a bu@@ b dress : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that has really hurt me .
when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt really attacked , ver@@ ified and dis@@ pat@@ ched .
then I look back and think me , &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public , they don &apos;t hes@@ itate to love their love : &quot; the people expect you a certain way , and the off@@ ended me .
and perhaps there may be some und@@ ank@@ fully , but I don &apos;t like it to just@@ ify me before the public . &quot;
Virginia Govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
. the democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening on a manif@@ estation with president tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many pra@@ yers and tell you ... today I will say you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally elected Govern@@ or . &quot;
the legislation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; in the morning I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added the Justice .
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement in the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice will not be the democratic candi@@ da@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he poss@@ esses the Kohl@@ em@@ ines in five states , and have inher@@ ited a car@@ et@@ ion from his father .
he is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee on Thursday evening a statement that said , &quot; The party change of Govern@@ or Justice is a further blow for a Democratic Party which would be back to us again to make our country again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ v@@ ings and the control of the least legisl@@ ative bodies in the history is the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice , only the last re@@ j@@ ection of a party , which is missing from top to bottom without guid@@ ing , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Ch@@ air@@ woman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a declaration of C@@ BS News .
Co@@ e lo@@ aves &quot; ehr@@ ing &quot; Russian exc@@ use for Dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ al
the World Chef of Athletics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday , which he described as a off@@ ence compensation from Russia to a d@@ op@@ ing sc@@ and@@ al , but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to be back to the sport .
Russian Athletics Women &apos;s Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ac@@ h@@ tin said during the IAAF World Congress on the eve of the World Athletics World Championships , that the feder@@ ation of his land was correct ; and that he was decided to fight the d@@ op@@ ing .
he said to him , for &quot; all athletes with compet@@ itions , gold and silver medals were car@@ ved . &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IAAF World Congress voted to be hang@@ ed in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) was nation@@ alized on state @-@ sponsored d@@ op@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very hon@@ est presentation , &quot; said IAAF president Co@@ e said the Rep@@ orters .
&quot; the whole Council and the entire congress were already known that the Russian Federation has experienced itself , that she has experienced some kind of hot times , and everything will be considered to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for his re@@ launch .
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress was achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment , Russia returned , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the guid@@ eline principle was always that we wanted to separate athletes from the ver@@ ted system , &quot; added

agriculture in the interview - How do we protect us before Gif@@ ts , Lord Schmidt ?
Germany is discussed above ver@@ se@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) Minister of Agriculture ( CS@@ U ) stands in an interview with the editor Network ( R@@ ND ) and answer .
Lord Schmidt , How does the consumer may protect themselves before po@@ ison@@ ing eggs ?
I can only check out the consumer of consumer and consumer , the eggs in your refrigerator .
based on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states are the most recent information on the affected eggs char@@ gen .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all , we know what we know , health haz@@ ard@@ ous is virtually excluded .
now Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central part of the clar@@ if@@ ier is not really true ?
the food surveillance is the task of the states .
nevertheless , my house has un@@ able to be switched off and is since conf@@ ession of Germany &apos;s people in the narrow exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
the trade has just as the manufacturers to bear wor@@ ry that the sold @-@ selling products and health are un@@ think@@ able .
if eggs is exceeded in eggs of 0,@@ 005@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic .
however , the eggs can be sold and del@@ ayed .
this time are not the agrit@@ uris@@ diction .
sitting production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
after the current knowledge , the production plants exceeds any immediate debt .
rather , they must count towards mut@@ ual illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is too little controls in the harvest .
is missing only on staff or even at the cryp@@ ting j@@ uris@@ diction ?
but there were just the official controls that have covered the process .
however , for truth , however , food products and criminal energy will never be excluded to 100 percent .
just because of these events , such a consequ@@ ence of such events and the transfer to the public pro@@ secutor &apos;s pro@@ secutor in cases where offen@@ ders can be found in those of which are cru@@ cial importance .
I have already been proven several times that I expect from the responsible authorities in the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm seri@@ ously really necessary ?
consumer goods and consumers have the right to get safe and secure food exclusively .
if a non @-@ approved in@@ sec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des in the food industry is used , consumer service and consumers are subject to right .
in contrast , manufacturers are manufacturers , dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
bas@@ ically it must be clear : the in@@ sec@@ tional use of in@@ sec@@ ti@@ z@@ ids Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of living @-@ supplier animals is not h@@ inn@@ eh@@ mbar and must be completed immediately .
it must be consist@@ ently consist@@ ently and worked with high pressure .
I expect from all compet@@ ent authorities that may be bre@@ d and ref@@ und@@ able to clar@@ ify the atom@@ ic authorities .
as the financial rules of the foot of football in Ne@@ ym@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football promises to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
some consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , for the leading organization that over@@ comes the European game , giving power from access to the prestigious Champions League @-@ tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA Cup , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been fin@@ anced without a major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) in order to buy the Brazil out of its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar is received a sal@@ ary that is more than ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ar moves to France .
PS@@ G can make safety the money , to make Ne@@ ym@@ ar , and put him into a galax@@ y of other stars , because of the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich rul@@ ing family of Qatar .
if you have to apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must include leg@@ itim@@ ate penetration sources , which allow them to make the Bre@@ ak @-@ Even point in her to the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini in 2007 after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French players believed that de@@ formation in their stre@@ aks after success had taken trem@@ end@@ ous deb@@ ts , effectively che@@ ered and ris@@ k@@ able to ru@@ in@@ ate if banks , or owner their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from the concentration to the deb@@ ts of clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potenti@@ ally bought and then power@@ fully invested in order to improve the crew and a global mark is to be challeng@@ ed .
during the current three @-@ year development period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini is fallen by the Pre@@ sidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA fol@@ lo@@ wers Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to continue to re@@ pose of excess issues .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA P , opposite the Associ@@ ated Press in the last week .
although the PS@@ G supports the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distri@@ bute the amount for invo@@ ice over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five year contract , so that the magn@@ itude will be evaluated for the next five years in the amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi which is owned by Manchester City , with the heav@@ iest sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine @-@ penalty of 60 million euros ( at the time 82 million dollars ) , which later increased to 20 million euros - and it was arranged to the Champions League for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is looking for clubs that could attempt to transfer their financial statements by using their income by companies that are connected to the owners of a clubs .
while a Catal@@ an company could spon@@ s@@ ors the PS@@ G spon@@ s@@ ors , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings would exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA did not apply to income taxes .
it happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the spon@@ sor@@ ing of the PS@@ A by the Qatar Tourism Authority is being operated .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G Pay@@ ments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s payment committee could come to Qatar in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 cle@@ ared that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Ambassador will be am@@ bassador and a great man@@ eu@@ ver for the UEFA regul@@ atory authorities .
the sanctions against PS@@ G would mean that the UEFA will be atten@@ tive , every attempt to change the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , th@@ ank@@ ed on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said among the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not given to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of over € 54@@ 2,4 million with a profit of over € 10 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be released .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrival a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , Mer@@ chand@@ ising and Jersey .
the association walks that the turnover is rising by at least 30 per cent by the signing of the signing .
the Spanish League was definitely irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player , and tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s way@@ mark that PS@@ G would mean the FF@@ P inj@@ ury .
&quot; it is a cle@@ ar@@ er case of &quot; finance d@@ op@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of cat@@ ars last re@@ union of PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sports @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , share the prevention of La Liga to a state that fin@@ anced an association .
&quot; it is the consequ@@ ence of own@@ ership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of the foot@@ balls in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you can go different ways or different interests , if a country has a way to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ g@@ il@@ ie@@ fer@@ ant
in recent years , choc@@ ol@@ ate has produced Fre@@ y abo@@ ard chocolate for the Swiss .
now , the s@@ iss@@ es co @-@ collabor@@ ates in front of one possible end : the airline writes the order .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ r@@ ott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; from Friday .
according to the current planning , Air@@ line will feature a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
all products would have checked all two to three years and sub@@ jected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current suppliers choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the female speaker .
approximately 17 million small red @-@ red fi@@ bro@@ g@@ it@@ af@@ les are distributed to 14 grams per year , covering the passengers before the landing .
over the cost , the Swiss wanted to do no information .
Bran@@ chen@@ in@@ sider estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achie@@ ves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more import@@ antly , the advertising effect is a prestigious order for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ manufacturer .
as many candidates there is on the new announcement , the Swiss will not be betra@@ yed .
but in question they are only Swiss manufacturer .
according to the newspaper article , choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of contract about the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate was not accessible to a statement .
chocolate bars distributed the Swiss Life on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss had completed his contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut delivered in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo , conducted Swiss prior to two and a half years ago with choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long distance routes will be p@@ amp@@ ered by the Con@@ fis@@ erie jum@@ ps , in the business class n@@ ou@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in the economy class Sch@@ og@@ gi of choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short course of Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business as well as in Economy Class .

this rep@@ et@@ ition of history is nost@@ alg@@ ic because of the gl@@ or@@ bit days of the characters from the 80 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ unge era ( as the pre@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ age the Sket@@ ch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for the M@@ TV act ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before her stars , like Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things .
as a cultural ar@@ te@@ facts , it is equally a par@@ ody and a sal@@ ary of our Facebook able era .
but it fe@@ els like Fran@@ ch@@ ise , when it was running time .
&quot; First Day of Camp &quot; worked sur@@ pris@@ ingly good , not just because of his ab@@ sur@@ d hum@@ or ( it contained a original history for a promising tin , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by playing on the core of the G@@ ags - actors medium age to play for children who are grown to grow , they still made the option to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; , with his adults who play now adults is less emot@@ ionally dist@@ ressed and his par@@ ody goes more after the foun@@ dry films of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that the cr@@ adle &quot; ) . &quot;
at a point , a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lov@@ able Coo@@ p ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has never forget K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite More@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his young people still lost .
and there is still another wei@@ t @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , in Ronald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good old impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the exchange rates of the best part of Fran@@ ch@@ ise .
it makes very much fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d to see the Matt Dill@@ ons Under@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now felt like an old boy .
there are the mom@@ ents of mad@@ ness , which this Fran@@ ch@@ ise could happen like a kind of repeated &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I will show as his logical concl@@ usions : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; .
&quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon , remin@@ is@@ cent of a different kind of nost@@ alg@@ ia : at the re@@ bel@@ ting of the Cold War of &quot; The Navy , &quot; to the film &quot; Atomic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with his East @-@ towards @-@ West Ring@@ combat @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography .

the main purpose - an hard fleet Gregor and an ideal I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alog@@ ues of Chann@@ ing Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt set in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than a idea .
there are some beautiful G@@ ags to see the police ( the police for@@ cing the time to watch chess in television as Americans do perhaps with football do ) .
and the list of famous spokes@@ person - including J@@ enny Sl@@ ate , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ ersh@@ ala Ali and Chlo@@ ë Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a wonderful game &apos; find voice out &apos; .
but &quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective &quot; is committed so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a doubt prop@@ ag@@ anda dr@@ ama - a mur@@ derer that carries a re@@ act mask is enough - that it is often playing as a single game .
with six episodes about six episodes , the com@@ edy is gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective &quot; that was re@@ dig@@ ged on a smaller length , could re@@ prove his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , because Gregory and I@@ os@@ ef always managed to visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two di@@ cken &apos;s men , who allow one bunch of Hamburg .
the Embassy for the imag@@ in@@ ates commun@@ ist audience is that the Western culture can do all for a v@@ age .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ator is not false : we can even make it with our own younger history and with the ih@@ y .
drive against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konst@@ anz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , are looking through numerous objects , like the public pro@@ secutor &apos;s office in Friday .
15 compl@@ aints were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and arrest warran@@ ts for these arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials ordered larger amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
at the same raid in Italy , two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
this is why the two are likely to be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were dep@@ orted .
the members of Maf@@ ia organized thre@@ es@@ cri@@ min@@ ality , severe violent acts , forced murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ex@@ press@@ ings .
since summer 2016 , the public pro@@ secut@@ ors has been determined against the organised drug trade in the South German room .
between the public pro@@ secutor in Const@@ ance and Palermo there was an re@@ ger exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ ater had almost daily touch with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the major order on Wednesday morning also accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo .
in particular , the investigation of the investig@@ ations returned to Italian Maf@@ ia , mainly Italian ma@@ f@@ ia .
even a incid@@ ent on the 27th of May in Ch@@ ats , at the early morning several shots were fired in a host@@ el@@ age , likely to go to the bank@@ roll of Ban@@ de .
way pro@@ claim large holes in fore@@ ign@@ ers @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens who should not sc@@ uba diving , &quot; : a report according to the fore@@ ign@@ ers of the fore@@ ign@@ ers in Germany has considerable M@@ än@@ gel .
the lead on asylum procedures related to asylum procedures .
the Federal Government Comm@@ ission@@ er for Re@@ fuge@@ e Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Way , has a media report according to large quantities of the foreign register .
M@@ än@@ gel with the registered data could lead to asylum procedures and dep@@ ortation . &quot; in part of the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; in an analysis that the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; could result in an analysis .
according to the register , ten million people are recorded with foreign citizens , including approx . 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
data will be administ@@ rated to Germany by approximately 600 pro@@ long@@ ed authorities in Germany .
because the data is not enough well maintained , be the data quality in parts so far not been good .
in ordinary cases , data from 1921 , &quot; of people who have long won &apos;t have more on life , or of citizens , the German national citizens are , and in the register actually should no longer be sc@@ uba diving . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data , return Process@@ es can significantly slow down , &quot; is the report to the report .
in statistics on the subject of trav@@ ellers , EU citizens are recorded , which should not have to travel .
but such incor@@ rec@@ tions carried out &quot; to a del@@ ayed debate about dealing with not@@ ep@@ tion@@ ist , &quot; it is hum@@ bled in the analysis .
meanwhile , the German government has appar@@ ently begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children return to Italy when they travelled from there .
this leads out of an internal paper of the Federal Institute for Migration and Re@@ fuge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; Neue Oz@@ ab@@ sent Newspaper . &quot;
in the paper , the BA@@ MF defines such procedures for families with children , with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - after Italy since 1st June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practi@@ cally no longer possible to read the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation .
according to Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for the refugees in the EU state .
if a mig@@ rant was re@@ warded to another EU country , this state may send him into the entrance eland .
for the grounds , the Office write now : &quot; meanwhile the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy increased significantly . &quot;
Italy have given for the recording and accommodation of families guarantees .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0,25 %
the Bank of England is expected to remain unchanged later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulation about an increase .
the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; orders &quot; will remain &quot; when they ret@@ ained the interest rates on family income in the midst of a reinforced compression .
the policy decision of the Mon@@ etary Committee ( MP@@ C ) of the Bank agree with 6 to 2 , the interest rates to 0.25 % , with this month fewer members had a rise in fact , because the weak economic growth is the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure is expected to continue to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next years Z@@ ins@@ elev@@ ations would be needed to be ir@@ regul@@ ated by the Bre@@ x@@ it regul@@ ated inflation and said that the loan has to rise more than expected to the financial markets .
members also voted to with@@ draw a part of the Mamm@@ ut Economic Recovery Package , which was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for financing plans to prepare for banks from the coming February budget for banks , although said it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
after the decision concerning the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pre@@ diction of the MP@@ C , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in short @-@ term , as the pressure on the Real@@ ms will continue to use the consumption of households . &quot;
at the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain fir@@ ming of monetary policy &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; size required would expect to expect the markets .
the markets expects the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; progressive &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would be limited . &quot;
the Bank forecast down@@ ward growth of the Bank for this and next year , compared with 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has ret@@ ained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound came to this messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0,5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 Euro .
the decision to no change , after the latest dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have increased the growing expectations for an interest increase and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easily accessible after the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report for@@ bid little enthusi@@ asm for households that will be affected by increasing inflation and slightly in@@ sured sal@@ aries , since the pro@@ sper@@ ity is first even worse , before it will be rep@@ ent .
it added that the monetary policy in the next few years could not prevent the income of income , &quot; but they added that the wages for the end of their three years could be re@@ cover . &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to weak Po@@ unds , which is part of the lower consumer spending .
the decision will come after the decrease of interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the scho@@ re @-@ based EU vote , which caused the feeding of the foot .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and economy .
prior to the last verdict of the Bank had risen to the interest rates , the rep@@ utation has increased its pressure on hard growing households , with three political decisions in July , a rise to 0.5 % .
the inflation has fallen in the past month of 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to return it again in the coming months .
the Bank said , the exceeding the ratio of 2 % be &quot; throughout the weak Po@@ unds . &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the short@@ able return of Sw@@ ap rate , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive more competitive , since the loan agreements are looking back to stores and want to finish this year in positive way .
the market looks especially good for those who run existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages include , and many with toll free options and low rates are always popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is alleged to raise HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the financing of medic@@ ations in N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV pre@@ venti@@ onal treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ recorded pre@@ ex@@ position of prevention ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of risk provis@@ ion@@ ics by around 86 percent , now comes from health service to a first three year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared itself to finance the trial , after the Court of App@@ eals Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court in the past year , when the N@@ HS had to pay attention , for pre@@ p , despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should be fin@@ anced .
the N@@ HS England CEO Simon Stev@@ ens was gre@@ eted by N@@ HS England as &quot; important new intervention &quot; was gre@@ eted as &quot; cru@@ cial moment &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) .
sexual health care in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first one who will allow the registration of people , and more clin@@ ics will follow in October 2018 before it will be launched in April 2018 .
Pre@@ ex@@ position of ph@@ yl@@ axis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequ@@ ence of HIV @-@ preparation which will be taken before sex to reduce the risk of a HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p was significantly reduced to HIV transmission in infection .
pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course , means that enough medic@@ ations are present in the body of a person to prevent a HIV infection .
such medic@@ ations can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
for those who come to the treatment in question , are sw@@ ule or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successful .
in clin@@ ics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a house physician , can also op@@ t for possible participation in their local participating Sex@@ u@@ al@@ k@@ linik .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medication in this week after an international competitive pro@@ cu@@ rement .
the study is to evalu@@ ate the entire potential of pre@@ p by combin@@ ing clinical evidence , as it is employed in a large scale , taken and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention &quot; should have the extensive and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV supplement and over@@ take .
it is another milestone in which more than three decades before the progress of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a cru@@ cial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if it is aimed at need@@ y and end@@ ang@@ ered people , the possibility of changing the English HIV @-@ epidem@@ ic .
from September to become people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ fin@@ anced attempt to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled , and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner which leads to the improvement of many , many life .
we welcome you very welcome . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out that the study is carried out fast throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV .
now , since the pre@@ p test medicine has been resol@@ ved , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows of Health , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is del@@ ayed after monthly adv@@ oc@@ ation and profit@@ able implementation through the government and over@@ due .
evidence show how trans@@ forming these drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention , and the transfer of these vital infection can finish .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
now it &apos;s important that this study is so fast as possible in the whole country to protect people , those HIV are infected , and that they will add care of the spread of HIV in the society a step closer . &quot;
life &apos;s life : mezzanine and cle@@ ver designer tri@@ cks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court in a gener@@ ous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker in a passion for real estate , collap@@ sed in 2014 from a big home in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne had not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my Ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ce@@ il@@ ings .
I love me in love and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a sh@@ aded layout - you had to go into the bedroom to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne St@@ aur@@ aum and a mezzanine to use the gener@@ ous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ce@@ il@@ ings , great windows , plenty of light .
this was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose , they assigned the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , the 12,5 feet high ce@@ il@@ ings and create a home , not just a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was on to create a mezzanine , in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to remember creative to solve the task .
&quot; the steel plant is rather comp@@ lic@@ ated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the premises so that they were over@@ st@@ acked , without that we had to go back to us .
it wasn &apos;t just therefore to build a simple platform , but the steel that it had the right height or below the right height . &quot;
this arrangement possible to place the fan , two rooms in full height over@@ lap - with a lot of additional dr@@ ama .
for the mezzanine is a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us beyond the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of sp@@ ans plays a role in the design of theatre , space and light .
on both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to allow him longer .
in the kitchen , it fe@@ els like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units can offer space for all stocks and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perc@@ eption of a smooth space , the beauty of the living room can ste@@ amed the kitchen if they are not used .
fol@@ dable kitchen are nothing new .
the special feature of this is that it is a gar@@ bage door .
&quot; a bit soap art went in , &quot; explains the fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; it is important so that it is very easy when you move the door to the door . &quot;
thanks to CLE@@ VER@@ EN util@@ isation of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne had an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you &apos;ll sell the base area - or as your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
in a ru@@ dim@@ entary form , a real estate agency will perform in real estate business and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they made it to use the base area to en@@ large and at the same time high @-@ quality materials that create space to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and they are therefore help to create a emot@@ ional eng@@ agement in a home &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electric sockets in walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat is characterized by a good design and increased square met@@ er@@ ates from a little standard in something very aston@@ ished .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fighting for a $ 500 million real estate agents because of a $ 500 million real estate agents
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family established the d@@ yn@@ ast@@ y family , in a med@@ itation due to one of the largest real estate imper@@ me@@ ar Vic@@ tori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ football club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul , who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clar@@ ify how their property and their business level will be split .
Paul tried to with@@ draw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp disp@@ ute on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 list@@ ings in the value of more than half a billion dollars , accum@@ ulated since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co je@@ ans founded the West@@ co je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail trade .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invest@@ ing in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centers in the subur@@ b .
following a agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - from Paul as &quot; principal author and the domin@@ ant person@@ ality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thir@@ ds of the company &apos;s business and Paul is approximately one @-@ third .
a recent file shows that Col@@ in own@@ ership of 316 million dollars and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash added to Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Col@@ in proposed re@@ dem@@ ons , what I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ ida@@ v@@ it in 2015 .
last Friday , after several failed attemp@@ ts , the first hearing of the Supreme Court rul@@ ing took place .
the brothers strug@@ gling for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , such as Paul claims , it is excluded .
Col@@ in arg@@ uments , this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul before , some sett@@ l@@ ements in@@ om@@ pet@@ ent .
in an early aff@@ ida@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to put the battle .
&quot; my Italian hei@@ r writes that the family &apos;s most important priority is , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ ida@@ v@@ its , e @-@ ma@@ ils and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading att@@ or@@ neys , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and of both sides .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband &apos;s husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants , the da@@ iry bars and del@@ ic@@ at@@ ess@@ ments from the late 1950 @-@ he and in the early sevent@@ y years a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood lawn , in Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ y family .
Col@@ in says that he began , when he was in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed , their property began to pass their sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to bring the brothers before the court , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not more part of the De Lu@@ tis company group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark at the contract of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid .
in both Luke , Paul , &quot; says Paul , &quot; has become the terms of its financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has felt very return , although he was a former A@@ FL board member and after a biography in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media adopted with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their law@@ yers contact .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case was before the courts .
&quot; it is very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to destroy me and draw our family name by the courts &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to ful@@ fil the demands of his brother &apos;s requirements .
&quot; our Father would not have sinned , that Paul and I would like to talk in our current disp@@ ute , &quot; he said , &quot; He will still trust &quot; to a solution . &quot;
on Friday , these hope will be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in .
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to transfer the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and are failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to prevent the information flow on president tr@@ ump - including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the b@@ oss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of Rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House on his first working day , he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he rep@@ aired the sound of the president .
Kelly told the staff that we should make information about him - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would make better decisions when he would get good information . &quot;
wa@@ ist diagnosis makes sense , but others have attemp@@ ts to monitor tr@@ ump by taking their media monitoring .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship with television goes back - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; if Candi@@ date Tr@@ ump was dis@@ missed due to an un@@ fair report , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of digits who were to con@@ vin@@ ce him , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam Nun@@ berg in February to PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ its under control , according to six former election campaign officers , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a stead@@ ily praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter has ever been &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this camp@@ a@@ wor@@ ms thing that we don &apos;t know what we don &apos;t know that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ et did not contain any add@@ itives without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably learn something about the Twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his staff made it a number of times , trou@@ bles from him was re@@ warded with him , then their efforts were re@@ warded .
but no one has consist@@ ently prevent tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y .
a part of the problem exists that people in a wil@@ low house which re@@ prove itself from conv@@ ene parties , always attemp@@ ting to present their own agenda , possibly prove their views from the world .
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO - based on this history - reported about the pre@@ diction of advis@@ er to introduce the president of strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump civil servants say that Tr@@ ump can re@@ act as a vol@@ cano in negative press lines , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he could easily find out what these origin@@ ate .
exactly what happened at the end of February , when som@@ eb@@ ody sent a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson who accused the dep@@ uty chief commander in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind him of Lec@@ ks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson has been b@@ anned from Twitter , or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he was sold in the past , or did it down in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher have added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce P@@ rieb@@ ke and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to manage a system to manage the paper to manage the paper . &quot;
how did the folded ?
Kelly tries three months later , to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective Manager as P@@ rieb@@ ke , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors are still influence on the influence .
these essential factors make the wa@@ ist mission very difficult .

the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to prove that evidence in pres@@ cri@@ bed cases and deci@@ ding whether the charge is charged .
Grand Jur@@ as@@ ies will also be called the brackets .
mostly it is enabled when it is about bigger and contro@@ versi@@ al cases .
the procedure will always be closed behind doors .
the panel can be switched on by the pro@@ secutor &apos;s pro@@ secutor in order to pres@@ cri@@ min@@ ate people under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , CN@@ N were already shown to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were ur@@ ged in a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultant and mother @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his then election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the discussion .
legal ent@@ atives said on Thursday night in U.S. TV that the introduc@@ tory indication that Mu@@ eller should not be on his work in his work , and that it should be necessary , quickly act wool .
but it didn &apos;t let that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of a charge .
nevertheless , the implementation of the ab@@ mi@@ ds of the beginning of a new phase in investig@@ ations and a new reason to occup@@ ying President Tr@@ ump .

&quot; the Russia history is a total in@@ vention , &quot; said tr@@ ump .
the topic give the dem@@ oc@@ rat one way to feel good , because they can &apos;t have anything else about that they may talk . &quot;
his special advis@@ or T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement that he knew nothing from the opening of a Grand Jury .
but this work even usually in the secret places , st@@ ressed .
the White House fe@@ ared any measures that acceler@@ ate the work of the Sonder@@ er@@ ator on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; manner .
former F@@ BI b@@ oss James Com@@ ey said three times that not to be determined against the President .

Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
at the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ k@@ tis , a gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg was replaced by the seven @-@ fold size Berlin@@ s from Sch@@ el@@ ight .
that told the Bre@@ mer@@ h@@ av@@ ener Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than a trillion tonnes , heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , large Kol@@ oss leave now to the north and will probably need two , three years until he mel@@ ted .
it is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice@@ berg , researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
in how far the climate change has played a role in the collapse of the ice sk@@ ill , it is un@@ clear after research information .
however , it has been a series of unusual coll@@ ars by iron pipes in the region , the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a facsimile .
according to many researchers , that can be sum@@ med up with the warming .
the broken col@@ t was so far a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrating .
pain flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrating s located south of South America almost at the head of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises was the balance of j@@ uni@@ qu@@ ets and ab@@ om@@ iting some years ago .
a complete scarf will be broken there , writes AW@@ I resear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it would be so that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrating show in danger , because the front edge had never moved so far as far as .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate under voltage and can be broken down , in case of a key collection .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ celebrating and Eis@@ berg ra@@ ises the sea level , since they sw@@ im on the water , and ice as much water , as it seems after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the tor@@ rent is that the gl@@ acier directly over@@ comes into the sea , and much faster than before .
this could increase the sea level , but only in the low dimension , the British research project writes in the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Midas ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrating s of AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the Ant@@ arc@@ tica has celebrated the fourth largest in Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
the transition from the main@@ land is up to 700 meters thick , on the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there will regularly be regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural view and no direct connection to climate change , the iron sign is now on a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; that is the most far re@@ treat since the beginning of the records , &quot; confirmed .
scientists be contro@@ versi@@ al if the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrating will again grow and possibly comp@@ lim@@ es , said his colle@@ ague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even if these researchers have not fall on climate change , even though this researchers have not fall into climate change , so many sh@@ ining of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula are destroyed in the past decade .
this long Zi@@ ran@@ ates of Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends the direction of South America .
according to data from the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 19@@ 50s .
at the decline , the temperature rise was contributed .
Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have fallen by around three degrees in the past 50 years , so that the temperature in which the temperature at the quick@@ est rise .
CD@@ U wants to household goods at personnel
because it is always difficult to de@@ pose free spots , requ@@ iring the CD@@ U , to join the emplo@@ yers to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k will be 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind .
the courses in the circle are evi@@ d@@ ently co@@ v@@ eted .
there were approximately 620 applications for this year to be able to sign up for this year .
non@@ eth@@ eless , the circle further staff to handle the aimed requirements and tasks .
at present the M@@ ett@@ mann district is currently 50 not occupied .
we are looking for doctors and engineers and powers of the general administration .
in the meantime , CD@@ U will now take place together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG &apos;s initiative and the head of the c@@ aster in the administration .
according to the request of the parties &quot; concept , a concept for personnel and personnel development . &quot;
the goal is to cover only short @-@ term thre@@ ats to specialized forces , but also the future oriented of the applic@@ ant is attri@@ but@@ able .
the overall concept should be focused on inside and outside , concrete measures for trans@@ verse entry and a training offensive include CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
it sounds like this , after a good approach .
because the circle has done it to do with personnel problems that they didn &apos;t know that .
other cities advert@@ ised good civil servants and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is given by a regular &quot; competition of the public emplo@@ yers . &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ due from the service .
so that is the highest time to handle , lest more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , Group Leader of the CD@@ U , goes out with his party on the common request .
he looked after a long day of preparation for a f@@ atal thick surprise than he ordered the human rights in question and the other parties bl@@ ossom .
people would like to prove that all possibilities will be reviewed , which facil@@ itate an outlet from the commun@@ al working association .
&quot; if we don &apos;t get short notice to a satis@@ factory solution , the cycle administration with the unions - maybe also in collaboration with the circular levels - a rise of children , so you peoples .
this is trying to pay the CD@@ U , employees and officials to pay better than it is the T@@ ari@@ for@@ d@@ nung for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exact , elev@@ ations or more money , if you changes in a higher level changes to the professional @-@ years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which to take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ st@@ itute protection law .
not the increasing number of asylum applic@@ ants have a problem with Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ der Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy spar@@ ed the sound to NGO mig@@ rants
in Italy , NGOs who use the rescue boats for mig@@ rants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they are not allowed to continue the rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs have no new code to write , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said the Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i , an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities made a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Res@@ c@@ ue &apos; , because their crew was effectively worked with human tra@@ ff@@ ers in a way which facil@@ it@@ ated illegal immig@@ ration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation since one year is in operation since one year , on the basis of the Italian state of the Italian state of Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us , and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so sorry we can operate in the moment not in search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said to social media .
&quot; we can claim all those who are currently collected only , after we have collected all the information and the situation may know . &quot;
the Italian authorities adopted the boat of &apos; Youth Res@@ c@@ ue &apos; , the I@@ u@@ venta , monit@@ ored since October .
it is believed that his crew have supplied mig@@ rants on board which can be supplied directly from human tra@@ ff@@ ers , that the ships can be used immediately .
at least one such meeting took place , only 1.3 miles in front of Liby@@ an coast , according to the Act of the Staat@@ san@@ wal@@ ker , whose content was published in Italian media .
the crew is susp@@ ected to susp@@ ected about the authority of Italian coast re@@ ven@@ ge , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ ives .
under the code of the code , boats have to abo@@ ard the I@@ u@@ venta , especially an Italian police officers , monit@@ ored their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue service , have previously explained to the code : Save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessary , but acceptable , because they would be no &quot; essential changes or dis@@ abilities &quot; of their life@@ actions .
among those who want to sign the Nobel Prize @-@ Lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation , doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of mig@@ rants , who had gone back after the life@@ jacket in Italy , in recent weeks that efforts to have borne the strength@@ ening of Liby@@ an coastal w@@ ache and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister .
he gave plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizens in this month on economic development initi@@ atives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of mig@@ rants to reach these countries in hope to reach Europe .

the castle and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed the view points , partly in towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing planes .

this also known the first German lig@@ aver@@ n , which is increasingly involved in this area .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg won the start of the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg in 2015 , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department and two professionals from the FIFA 17 computer games .

what is it exactly ?
in the E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; counter@@ strike &quot; or even the football @-@ simulation FIFA at the compet@@ itions .
recently , as in the normal sport , it was also established , well @-@ established , in which the pro@@ s were each other in each other .
and at the Asia , E @-@ Sport has already been part of the official program .
but it is a proper sport in all ?
for many , the introduction safely need to be certain .
Ingo O@@ evil has a long time with the question .
for the professor at the German sports school in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sports , because it is compet@@ itive and many biological and physical respon@@ ses you can also find in classical sport , for example , elev@@ ations , hormon@@ al changes , hormon@@ al changes .
furthermore , there are cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ er should not only training on the console , but also their bodies on the diet .
&quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot;
but he looks like problems : &quot; d@@ op@@ ing will always be a theme . &quot;
inspec@@ tions are difficult at online games , and the scene was missing the structures of classical sports .
the scientists determined the high @-@ integ@@ rative effect of the e @-@ sports .
the players are internationally on the way , as a great global family , there is no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study of corporate consult@@ ancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth .
this represents a 50 million euros in Germany in 2016 , mainly by advertising , spon@@ sor@@ ing and big tournaments .
sales in three years is expected to be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of football major Bundesliga , the soccer le@@ ague is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports like Hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the U.S. where ex @-@ basketball ho@@ ists Sh@@ aqu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez on the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports contest in Uni@@ kr@@ n .

&quot; in the European comparison , Germany , V@@ f@@ B executive board explains the Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .

this is why the tradition of the association is to pres@@ erve the company at the same time in the modern market .

Michelle Carter because of the texts that Conrad Roy to su@@ icide by su@@ icide , sentenced
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because they encour@@ aged their friend by ly@@ rics and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their assessment behind G@@ it@@ ants and five years were exposed to the currency .
in June , Carter was sentenced to his life imprisonment in June 2014 , which took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ tr@@ apped .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter dur@@ ate until the appeal is free .
she was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representative ar@@ gu@@ ed that they had suffered for Mr Roy to an psych@@ ological disease .
in red trousers and a cre@@ amy blo@@ use , Carter da with te@@ ars in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; said the State law@@ yers . &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has no Re@@ ue . &quot;
but Car@@ ters att@@ orney he said , &quot; Be a terri@@ ble thing about it . &quot;
judges Lawrence Moniz said , however , did not found that you mean &quot; age or tyre @-@ rad or even their intel@@ lec@@ tual influence on their actions . &quot;
a state pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mutter Lynn Roy , who think there is no day that I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved Son .
I would like to know that he is proud of me and how I am with everything . I try to bear with all of my pain , who will be able to be with us for his sisters , for his sisters , is it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dyn Roy , said that she will be per@@ sec@@ uted by the knowledge of his brother or will never be part of his brother &apos;s wedding .
&quot; not more these only person who have been together since my birth has been together since my birth , is a pain , whom I will keep my life for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
the case seems to set a legal prec@@ ed@@ ence , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it to ask for another , to go to another &apos;s su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a Kohl@@ en@@ mon@@ oxide po@@ ison@@ ing in a vehicle .
the case moved national attention after Car@@ ters Text@@ ile dep@@ artments that they had encour@@ aged him to end his life .
&quot; hanging up , spring of a building , but I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages , who had sent them in two weeks before his death , while he was with his family in the holiday .
in the eye before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing that you must do , is the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Moniz said that Carter told his death by Roy , and ordered that they may benefit from any press of the case .
the case has informed the legal opinion .
one of the few , the Carter def@@ at@@ ons , Am@@ anda Knox , was convic@@ ted for murder of their British fellow resident in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted on two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times published a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter des@@ erv@@ es Co @-@ feeling and help , not cap@@ tivity . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed as captain in the Audi Cup , is not a co@@ incidence .
FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Conf@@ ed @-@ Cup winner a great season - extra @-@ motiv@@ ation sch@@ a@@ det .
something really was on his place in the cabin , Joshua heard Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very small .
but there was far away and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups of course , there was no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel New to see him , he made him to the arm of the arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced , &quot; told the Conf@@ ed @-@ Cup winner , after his first use as Bayern @-@ captain .
well , the understanding could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the Coach K@@ imm@@ i could also indicate .
not the eight year old Art@@ uro V@@ idal was born in the youth players , de@@ fle@@ eing and just out of the holiday , existing C @-@ El@@ f player has been chosen as a player , but he .
sugar has been distributed in love to those who want a lot to do with laugh@@ s .
so who was trying to join the hei@@ r of L@@ ah@@ m , you can only need a small extra @-@ motiv@@ ation only .
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what a player wants to take responsibility : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old has a mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m above the field .
on the back , this is now his position , the white bin@@ ds at the arm did her rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this starting transformation like that , who can also take the best in the hands .
he gave instructions , attemp@@ ted to len@@ ess the trou@@ pe of trou@@ pe .
he had the view for Gan@@ ze , while many others were bus@@ y themselves .
V@@ idal thus , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ ks hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus able to go down on the main achievements of Asia journey ( fol@@ ks are only due to only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
that &apos;s cool quite well .
Sü@@ le ran along with K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the bri@@ gade , both ag@@ ates sou@@ th@@ ly .
the promin@@ ent occupied Nap@@ oli storm did so hard to act as well as a few times in the game .
his colle@@ ague Rud@@ y said to that the result &quot; was not so much as we have hop@@ ed for us . &quot;
but he also showed a regular performance .
game change , template change : &quot; for this style , I was also p@@ icked up . &quot;
as un@@ inhabited this Bavaria @-@ world still is for the re@@ furb@@ ishment , I looked after the game .
Rud@@ y for instance was not one or two , but determin@@ es six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed away after a few cr@@ ack@@ ers in the back of his new fellow players .
there he list@@ ened to the sweet sentence : &quot; what is here , I have already done here .
at Bayern , you must just win any game . &quot;
after all , he must not bring the New Testament .

one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles .
the BMW ch@@ air@@ woman said that &quot; there is the opinion that &quot; it gives intelligent options as a travelling limit , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
k@@ one of the company described the companies as a feedback .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the comply with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen ox@@ ides , which are em@@ in@@ ox@@ ides , may apply as car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and may cause ast@@ h@@ ma .
the cost of car manufacturer , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install from diesel vehicles , can also assume what it makes it difficult to get the price of the cars more competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be charged to ign@@ ore the most powerful car companies and the sign of the problem .
the company try to avoid the error of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called de@@ cent devices to regul@@ ate emissions if a car was tested , but at normal travel conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former managers , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and therefore not be protected against ex@@ tradition and could be put into the United States in front of judgment .
at the beginning of this year , Audi clin@@ ched the German criminal investig@@ ations in Volkswagen after the authorities have installed an system to use the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request to concentrate on the United States .
the incl@@ usion of Audi into the study could automatically load Volkswagen hard drive : the luxury car manufacturer carries dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately for the winning of Volkswagen .

lav@@ ender from Provence of climate change threat@@ ens
he has become a symbol of Provence in South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is rec@@ essed due to Dür@@ re rec@@ lassi@@ fied conditions and due to the diseases of in@@ se@@ cts , scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great he@@ ada@@ ches .
Eric Ch@@ a@@ isse , expert of the Agr@@ ar@@ Research Institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effective , because the plant has been exposed to climate change because the plant has brought much less rain within the last years , and in autumn much more .
this has imp@@ acts on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf sh@@ ades , and with very dry conditions there are very many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil loos@@ ed not only for holiday , it is also popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Ch@@ a@@ isse said , &quot; instead of very long plant oh@@ ren with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered to be considered , include a better water distribution and slow@@ down from the soil , but also the be@@ aten plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of weekly Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ esdays , in order to review their plans for the report on the youngest ch@@ aos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through the organized crimes , cor@@ rupt officials and un@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of her own trag@@ edy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was dealt with them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what he fe@@ els : they will take their children with the office , who were in 2009 the goal of an attack with gran@@ ules , or at home .
safety signs have three words on a panel at the front of the noise : opp@@ onents , neutral , ally .
you request rep@@ orter , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions and ab@@ dom@@ inal fe@@ el@@ ings .
there are dr@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , polit@@ icians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are susp@@ ected , on the other list of government or the box list , a catalog of Ver@@ bre@@ books that make the ch@@ aos of Mexico .
there are no hom@@ ep@@ och of violence , and throughout the country the bodies are more often : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto opened its position in December 2012 . 589 , after attacks and thre@@ ats under German laws and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries .
the latter is the editor and its in@@ spir@@ ator by Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
its lack is de@@ fied , although its presence is present everywhere . two rep@@ orter in the three years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear T @-@ Shirts , showing his smile of the face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orter discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , sleep , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 , a special procedure was erected in order to process the cases of journalists , these according to the Committee of journalists det@@ ained only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders who are associated with drug trade and organized crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will only rarely be judged by journalists .
at Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , they still exist to treat the force of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ apped and even though the ter@@ rain is now available .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without righteousness , the meeting to discussion of security little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very st@@ up@@ id to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; says he .
&quot; as long as we know not the Why do we know . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
it only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla from two men . he was shot down from his car and 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated to &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the cont@@ actors passed away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors incl@@ ined to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practi@@ cally nothing more silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans has been arrested for arrest in the last year and ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the blo@@ ody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since ri@@ val@@ is@@ izing fr@@ actions are fighting here to fill up the vacuum .
it is nothing of that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day someone or more people on the road , or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of dist@@ ressed , two @-@ storey maus@@ ol@@ een for dr@@ ones , the larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranqu@@ ility &quot; if only a cart@@ el takes control over the coastal area with its valuable har@@ bo@@ urs and drugs ro@@ uting in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was consci@@ ously aware of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , one of them that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two ab@@ normal@@ ities have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the release of a interviews with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a ri@@ val@@ ance cart@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may be off@@ ended with the sons , thought Gang@@ members bought every copy of the edition as soon as she was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second error was in it , Val@@ dez don &apos;t go to z@@ win@@ gen , after the compl@@ ying of another newspaper that had the same story , the country had to leave its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his pot@@ ence is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived , that his friends and colleagues were ann@@ ame that he would always be there .
he was employed as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he completed five colleagues to the establishment of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to do journ@@ alism , without the noise d@@ ote problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time the newspaper served a rep@@ utation for the encour@@ age and hon@@ est report , and sales and advertising .
rep@@ orter loved it , hard tre@@ ating investig@@ ations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fas@@ c@@ inated by a publication where they could read more otherwise .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez win the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his cour@@ age at the per@@ secution of the Mexican drug history , where it was always guided .
he gave himself up that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to live , &quot; he said to the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug store in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; it must take you to take you as a journalist - either that or you play the Dum@@ men .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done so many dead ... why did you not say what went off ? &quot;
the Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could flu@@ ke like a harbour lab@@ our@@ ers , the friend , the gener@@ ous with flo@@ ods and rating , a teacher , knew how to survived .
they tru@@ sted to his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and there are always sitting at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine ?
his death also has forced to ask her own adv@@ ances in question , how they can stay their work at the best , and stay in life on the life .
&quot; they don &apos;t like to move with their wives , their children , their clean@@ se shops , their home starting and ways of ways to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ zen@@ ship and self @-@ locking .
his own inst@@ inc@@ t trust .
if it wer@@ wrong , lead them away .
the trouble is , said the editor of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; Sm@@ ell can be a sense that happens ... and then the thing happened with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - same as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ p@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative lubrication , weak institutions and cor@@ rup@@ ted government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room which we met the staff of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce for security training , suddenly there were no phones allowed . days previously , Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments , used to monitor journalist and activ@@ ists in Mexico .
outside polic@@ emen protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were instruc@@ ted by the country &apos;s government to protect the offices of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce in a mid @-@ class @-@ quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , sur@@ vey@@ ed some of the rep@@ orter whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen who described themselves as a tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months now , since the rep@@ orter went to the mountain scenery , where the drug associated de fac@@ to are under control .
for the edition of this week Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce has moved on three main layers .
there was the assass@@ ination of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Ch@@ av@@ ez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to citizens , concentrated on the h@@ omet@@ own of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Office of the Office .
there was no official word about it , who was kid@@ n@@ apped , or as it happened , so was careful when it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite place of thre@@ ats and authorities .
a rep@@ orter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a political kers , who ruled the reign@@ ing institu@@ tional revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which controlled all political levels in the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of cor@@ ruption of cor@@ ruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the rep@@ orter of writing about previous incid@@ ents in this Lok@@ al , among them one who went into a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man .
only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez have been regarded as the best known source on the kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; in early we would have recovered what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its sli@@ m body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office has been dedicated to a storage space for characters and sticker , dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the staff had become something , what they never had expected : activ@@ ists in the name of the press .
rep@@ orter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ ap@@ te a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalists to the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame van@@ ished three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and civil servants , based on DNA tests that it is his .
journalists had been stronger than the whole country by giving the prot@@ ests &quot; SOS Press &quot; in organized prot@@ ests and construction in organized prot@@ ests .
at that day , Director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone into Washington and tries to collect international support for the Justice in the Fall of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez acc@@ use the authorities , journalists will dis@@ playing and bring them to the truth , because they have told the truth .
she has since then asked that it is imp@@ acted by the government , because it is imp@@ acted that her rage is injured their objective .
in Val@@ dez , Val@@ dez had said that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes , involved government officials and an equal society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that Rep@@ orter are not only killed by drug tra@@ p , but also on the command of polit@@ icians and security forces that led with the organized crimes under a blank@@ et .
last year , the media art group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants .
&quot; in Mexico you live because they want to hold the mouth , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said .
obviously , the Mor@@ de have a ab@@ hor@@ ri@@ ous effect .
no one pro@@ ves the death of the b@@ log@@ in Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ p@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas sam@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone plates next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ l@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
other do further , as El Man@@ ana was done by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of their direct investment in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed to the drug card on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and observe the streets and seek after danger .
and sometimes they become ch@@ ased , as it manif@@ ested to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be a poet that the drug store him troubled him .
&quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and therefore I was Rep@@ orter , &quot; he said .
around midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already completed , the ed@@ itors of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce was on the office and tran@@ s beer , than once all their phones began to Sum@@ men .
a series of shooting with band ri@@ val@@ es and security forces near the se@@ aside Maz@@ at@@ lan had 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the st@@ on@@ ew@@ are , they have released the news on the website of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce about mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed on the next day .

Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez casting a look at the polic@@ emen who held the guard to see if they were in standby .
if they were afraid of all , they did not show them .

&quot; how can you only remember it , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when on the same day , on the same day , the intern@@ ship was murdered , she asked me to send it on the road to the road . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used cam@@ ouflage to so@@ ak his enemies
at the first glance , it looks like a statue , even though a sc@@ ent .
now , researchers found that the first findings of the un@@ belie@@ vable rhin@@ oc@@ acy of a Canadian min@@ ers so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his sh@@ ri@@ pped skin of red@@ dish @-@ brown was - and they said , they would have had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past &quot; .
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; called him as &quot; the be@@ ster@@ ing arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s who ever been found , and one of the best Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s spec@@ im@@ ens of the world . &quot;
F@@ ossil is a newly discovered kind of N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k@@ age between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably good condition has researchers that really worth it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ oured plant makes the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on March 21 , 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock on the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more .
the F@@ ossil discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.100 kg ) .
after all of these hard work , the ready result is now ready to be unveiled .
&quot; if you come only a little with eyes blind , you could almost believe that it has sle@@ pt , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , sci@@ entist at Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is shown .
&quot; it is one of the most beautiful and best preserved Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s spec@@ im@@ ens - the Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant f@@ ress@@ er , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , probably from flesh , probably re@@ fres@@ her Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the heavily stock@@ ed Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves , and used a screen@@ ing@@ system that is known as a counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and his enemies , experts , what suggest@@ s that it was threatened by larger din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the 110 million year @-@ old cre@@ ature dating from the N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s family made for the first time frame and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studies the wild animal studies and there are Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum techn@@ icians Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it .
the amazing preserv@@ ation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of she@@ ds and arm@@ aments on his body .
it covered the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady , a common Defense Meth@@ od in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker was as their under@@ side .
although the actual sh@@ ady is usual , the results are sur@@ pris@@ ingly , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta as far as far as the living animals survi@@ ves today .
it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of sufficient pressure caused by flesh to re@@ fres@@ her Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s that evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation of con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals allowed to use the sh@@ ady p@@ sh@@ ady or belt animals - are much smaller and injured as a pre@@ y , what sign@@ alized that this N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s was exposed to a real battle .
&quot; strong pre@@ b@@ tier behavior on a massive , strong arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s @-@ smoking animals have to have been &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was red .
scientists continue to exam@@ ine the animal on crit@@ ics over his life , including his conservative loans to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s died when he died , into a river , and be@@ aten up into the sea , where he sank on the front of the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was so warm like South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans are likely to spread much more land@@ ward than they are today .
&quot; this N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s is really remarkable because he is fully covered with preserv@@ ative skin , but also in three dimensions stays and the original form of the animal has ret@@ ains , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost as well as in the early delivery time .
they don &apos;t need a lot of imag@@ ination to re@@ construc@@ t it . if you &apos;re just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was time , as huge thermal des , car@@ ni@@ ze Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , which stood on two legs on the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ os@@ aur@@ us Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of some of his f@@ row@@ ter@@ restri@@ al ancest@@ ors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ aur@@ us , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy mon@@ sters .
the scientists , which appear to appear in current biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was removed after the death in the sea and in the mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on March 21 , 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum it is the fo@@ ret@@ ained arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur in the world , including skin and arm@@ ament , and is completely from the sn@@ out to the hip .
the cre@@ atures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips made by his sh@@ oul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant was flo@@ wed by the Western Canada by the West Canada , until a flo@@ oded river was flo@@ wed into the open sea .
but the under@@ water cre@@ mation of the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s preserved its arm@@ ament in exquis@@ ite detail .
the st@@ one@@ ous over@@ throw of this special copies are so well preserved that the skin is still un@@ challeng@@ ed tank plates along the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , it is such a level of preserv@@ es such as a profit in the l@@ otto .
the more I see it , the more ren@@ der it will .
Pet@@ rified resi@@ dual of the skin still cover the hol@@ pri@@ cing tank plates that bear the sk@@ ull of animal .
his right front foot is situated on his side , his five fing@@ ers are stored on the top .
I can count the scales on his sole sole &apos; .

as a AZ @-@ rep@@ orter , it also reported on the way to massive dis@@ abilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade noted the license number of vehicle fle@@ ction , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ al@@ ties .
shortly after 18 : 45 hr@@ s. then a second accident at the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between an Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ ger and a passenger car .
a c@@ ue helicop@@ ter was on the road to the accident .
German rail@@ ways : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that has experienced almost once again : nothing is sitting at the train and sleeps .
or man is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
in the heart of the work@@ flow , the rh@@ einf@@ alls comes from the work@@ flow in the midst of the work@@ flow .
postcard control .
but the times of inter@@ ruption are coming soon .
the German rail@@ ways currently test@@ ify the ren@@ der@@ less driver control .
you can simply be confirmed by phone that you have taken his place and evaluated the ticket card .
at present , a test mode runs on two routes .
&quot; we offer the offer , we have made it out .
it is expected to be available in early next year to many other remote control routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway speaker .
&quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the way to get the card valid@@ ation without the rh@@ einf@@ alls .
to use the requirements , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or a tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what you need to do most passengers .
you have to bought it about the app the DB Navigator , which is a comfortable type of ticket booking .
and last you need a seat placement .
for the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; : you will rise up in the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My tickets &quot; on .
then a button for electronic de@@ valuation then appears with the test results .
the addition to their mobile devices have a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is in the train and has taken the booked seating for Y .
arri@@ ves to the driver control at # Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already valuable online ticket .
so you can continue to continue , continue to keep further silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers that should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; he who want to travel without a ticket control by our train travels , check out in the DB navig@@ ator itself .
this enables passengers to design their journey time in the train &quot; train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board by DB correspondence .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs . &quot;
those often does train ride , know that next to del@@ ays and pas@@ sion@@ ist trains will belong to the largest doctors .
because often one has enough , in any case , one of the compet@@ ence not all documents , you need to use online tickets for the evaluation of online tickets .
either is missing the credit card or personal credit card or one document that you must have .
the consequ@@ ence are endless discussions between train conductor and driving g@@ ast , which leads to bad mood in part or large space and del@@ ays during the control of your own tickets , and will take care of the career at the end of the time to take care of others .
only a small number of test customers use the new service .
and only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not registered .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken until her core .
only one day after it arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
they proud about a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police killed just an 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; called it there .
conf@@ used , since no one had posted on her Fe@@ ed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah is constantly rented on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed .
he post@@ ete a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body which was stretched out on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; that is a wild , &quot; thought far from himself .
but death was not new for her and their fel@@ lowship .
she made her cell phone to return to Twe@@ et on the Can@@ field Drive on the evening on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police and people , the cr@@ ying , and of a man who claimed to be a shield with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police has killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they wat@@ ched a live Fe@@ ed , with a group of demonstr@@ ators in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ine dog .
in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman is his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; Animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; that is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remember@@ ed her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s not the kind of murder , which we have spo@@ iled to us , and which we can rely . &quot;
at this moment , I felt dry frost .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she bu@@ ck a return trip , and went home to the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she won their 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning were to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ em@@ as from 11 .
it is a history of survi@@ ving and protest , the strength and the loss of power , the strength and the resistance , which consists of the point of people living in the community and the streets are filled to ask answers .
when Fer@@ rell carried out with her daughter , a flower dress and a matching crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation which she had count@@ less times before this morning , &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight against what they believe ? &quot; she remin@@ ded that what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and did not work correctly .
I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
&quot; what happened to today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
they must know and see it and on it .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to be free to free for ourselves .
even if I do good luck , you have experienced an experience , when they have experienced no ek@@ lat@@ ant rein@@ for@@ ism , it is not different than the next black female child .
I have the feeling I would give you a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
the first station in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a village opposite the police authority , which was waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there were Fer@@ rell and her daughter with a local business @-@ company , lunch made .
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ted them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly I started to take a new kind of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m has changed after 9 August , and said , &quot; she said , &quot; she said that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i St. Louis President of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i St. Louis &apos;s president and health in@@ equ@@ alities in black municip@@ alities .
&quot; I had no experience in the organization .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met at the Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ eram@@ an Lucas Alvar@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to be documented &quot; what happened .
a question came in the sense : &quot; you want to find it or try to find a story that you can ut@@ ili@@ ze her ? &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ sis was nour@@ ished by count@@ less cases of people , often from the White - in a community who benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an has recently explained in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices shall not be cent@@ ered and we wanted to do it differ@@ ently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m rum of death .
his commitment brought the project closer , together with six other in@@ scri@@ bed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary isn &apos;t someone who speaks for us or with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; that was the major thing for me , as these people are depic@@ ted , because I will be displayed . &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - they proved itself as the manif@@ est participant in the film .
consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel lives , like she loves and married her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said F@@ ar , and laugh@@ ed , when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I understood that in this work , and the human being of the black people have to give a certain hurt . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel &apos;s story repeated the role of black sw@@ ays women in the wider Black @-@ Liv@@ es @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement that have changed the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identify the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the motion , &quot; said F@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting at various fron@@ ts .
black , pregnant women need to bear the main load of all . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an voted to note that &quot; the movement really kept the movement of black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it is that &quot; this is not an aff@@ ir@@ ative type of action , &quot; when the ferm@@ entation was chosen as heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who fe@@ ars this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , although she was in front of the front , because at a life in these cru@@ ises than a black , swe@@ at woman so much on the game .
you can feel your energy by the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long gone , but the rac@@ ial connections between the congregation and the police are still living .
Fer@@ rell &apos;s deadline for 2 ½ years due to block the block at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a ch@@ aos . &quot;
nevertheless she was ob@@ li@@ cked at a song and she felt this mem@@ orial , since they left three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road .
&quot; it is our oblig@@ ation to fight our freedom .
it is our oblig@@ ation to win .
we must love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; up &quot; size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV @-@ Reader discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery move the people , although they are not built for long .
but the idea of a shopping center at the Southern of the pe@@ de@@ strian zone has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first presentation in 2009 , the population in Be@@ acon and opp@@ onents .
the topic is hardly any one .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; on our Facebook page .
while the one @-@ bit gallery say , &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; needs no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi . &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the fe@@ ared there@@ on , there is a gallery more customers into the city , including the remaining shops , fear the opp@@ onents that the pe@@ de@@ strian zone is hi@@ ps .
added to the gallery : the gallery is planned on the grounds of the market , in which 13 direct mark@@ ers will offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the gallery @-@ Ma@@ cher want to integ@@ rate a market in the new building - and to the Bed@@ a square with possibility to sit without sitting .
Simone guest rooms : &quot; we have been offering almost weekly in the pe@@ as@@ ant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country can always be glad .
we discovered the but@@ chers we discovered for us .
we would like to wish us that during and above all after construction of the gallery there is a chance to get rid of this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
especially the small mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether for direct mark@@ eted in the gallery of the gallery , we arrive at the height of the rent .
the new project is probably just too low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; why buy shopping at Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ pping or super@@ markets : I find it liquid .
of which there are enough in our city .
you can see how many charges are empty here - some for months and years .
but there &apos;s not even a regular weekly market , it is so important that at least the Mark@@ thalle remains at least once again .
because after all , the service offered goods are fresh , is mainly offered directly from the product and is available in in@@ expensive .
as you can see , the shop will be rented in a shopping centre only of larger firms , because the dor@@ ms are often not affordable for one retail@@ er .
shame , special business there is almost no more and that , which is still left , then will probably van@@ ish . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a mark@@ thalle suitable for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially where is the pe@@ as@@ ant market during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration if the bit gallery is actually actually come .
or does it know the full bit gallery before , to distri@@ bute all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not work .
and a shopping center , which is empty , does not need to use .
I would have been better to promote my view to promote a real pe@@ as@@ ant market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ as@@ ant market , it is definitely a lot more - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no space more .
if the pe@@ as@@ ant market is capit@@ ated , a piece of culture is van@@ ish . &quot;
a matching simil@@ ar@@ ity : artist creates port@@ raits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible the same - which are attached to cables from the ceiling .
the 30 port@@ raits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ mann created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the ex@@ cer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ zer was a 35 @-@ year prison sentence when she was publicly trad@@ ited to the &quot; Wik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak &apos;s website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ ar@@ ity ) .
it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipl@@ ine has been united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and dis@@ card@@ ed dis@@ sid@@ y , whose convic@@ tion was converted to Barack Obama , when he was only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extrac@@ ted by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA which could be extrac@@ ted with these gen@@ om@@ atic data , such as someone with these genetic data could not only be interpre@@ ted to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways can be interpre@@ ted and the har@@ dening detection of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born when Brad@@ ley Edward was born , but since its pu@@ ber@@ ty open on the identification of a woman , was convic@@ ted for 20 charges , including six mut@@ ations against the Sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer was and the@@ ft .
by the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that it was only one single photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits un@@ likely on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ inum bl@@ onde per@@ forms - which was associated with them .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; St@@ ran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist port@@ raits of stran@@ gers such as c@@ ig@@ st@@ umm@@ el and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ted the DNA from the waste , to produce a picture of them how it might look like this people .
this was the time that she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and wanted a kind of portrait to ac@@ company this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she was not able to visit this time and could not be photograph@@ ed , therefore they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted a DNA portrait .
the artist and their in@@ haf@@ re M@@ use were inter@@ acted to our letters that inter@@ changeable several letters in the course of two years .
she even asked one of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed images &quot; which would be a future predic@@ ting to see the President Chel@@ seas judgement and she would like to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was only few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brut@@ al years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happ@@ ier meeting .
there is also at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , because Donald Tr@@ ump led a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camps and against trans@@ ying troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to cover the rigid sp@@ ur which he should actually be able to fl@@ aming .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she told that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one of the wall of the gallery of the gallery , Mann@@ ing resulted in their over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) is an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ ment , whose foundation is sex , bre@@ ed , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ths of C@@ s and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , through the incl@@ usion of 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) as an aston@@ ishing , at least in biological execution , we all are .
&quot; what people hop@@ efully will take care , that our gen@@ ome is not concerned , who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a own room , is one page from the above mentioned com@@ ic nov@@ els .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it comes with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hand out of the discipl@@ inary of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; if they ch@@ ill your speech , then they won . &quot;
&quot; so will never see the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came from a letter that she has written to me , &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia .
&quot; I am still visible even if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen himself - as it was pres@@ ently seen in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it in the middle of the room of the mas@@ ks , it will be gre@@ eted by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulations that were sum@@ mar@@ ched as hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
this also was targeted , as all in the exhibition , until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , which have been written with pencil , with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel as a human quantity , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the port@@ raits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , as the movement that wand@@ ers even behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a employee of the University of Oxford for pot@@ ence
a nation@@ wide human @-@ hunt is in the G@@ ange for a professor at North@@ western University and a employee of the University of Oxford , having been searching for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with f@@ atal inju@@ ries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several engra@@ v@@ ings died .
a par@@ ent warning system by Chicago , published in Chicago , was discovered that the cor@@ che was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several inju@@ ries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the place of the si@@ eve for dead , and Det@@ ectives investig@@ ate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking to the two susp@@ ects .
since 2007 , L@@ ath@@ em has been professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , Vice @-@ President of the university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em now has been excluded , and was excluded from the camp@@ us of the North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the compet@@ ent authorities , and the North@@ western University enc@@ oded with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage .
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the university and the Som@@ erv@@ ille College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are ready to contact with the police in contact and ready to help the U.S. Invest@@ ig@@ ator authorities . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues sho@@ cked and want that he exhibited himself .
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he needed to establish the susp@@ ects on the authorities .
&quot; the police have a vision of their stay , and our efforts to loc@@ ate them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call of the building of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ building that had just received a di@@ zz@@ y tip that had just happened in the apartment 1008 .
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that it was un@@ clear if the incid@@ ent was taken at the 27th of July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police is currently working at the time axis and the background of the victims , including a variety of mot@@ ives , including one possible formation . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA driver in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be converted to the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( RU@@ SA@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ fill@@ ment of the road@@ map RU@@ SA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
the WA@@ DA driver was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM comm@@ ented the second part of the WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes criteria for re@@ integration of RU@@ SA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organisation .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the WA@@ DA during the near future . &quot;
one of those in the list mentioned criteria , however , states that the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing authorities demonstr@@ ates the reported outcome of the investigation conducted by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian att@@ orney with the Canadian Att@@ orney by Richard McLaren .
in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the exam@@ inations because our anti @-@ Dop@@ ing system has had an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not do something that does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words voted by Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales department R@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov problems of the past in Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeated that the report about the contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one has added any report to accept this report , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added .
RU@@ SA@@ DA was dis@@ missed in November 2015 in the course of the d@@ op@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA by d@@ op@@ ing control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that RU@@ SA@@ DA declared &quot; into the right direction &quot; moved to again .

it also offers an anon@@ ymous SMS @-@ Hot@@ line that can subscri@@ be to the staff of bad behaviour .
and when the principal leaders is covered , compl@@ aints to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of the public opinion has been recorded , &quot; Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ically , it can be cost@@ ly consequences by consumers @-@ bo@@ yc@@ ott , worker flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ation and compl@@ aints , said Jes@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than a year to ensure that people are aware of politics and procedures , and have an easy way to reach their operational headquarters .
previously , if a employee of a problem was to sign or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the corporate headquarters , a formal compl@@ aint and hope that he was serious .
it was often a not@@ ori@@ ous and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good way to track the compl@@ aints of employees .
now , since the company converting Conver@@ cent , problems , which were previously identified by ex@@ ecu@@ tives , which were hidden in offices in cities or States , have been identified as dis@@ cri@@ mination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ mist@@ akes tra@@ inees .
&quot; I can closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view to experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who lead the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in Emp@@ loyment Law . &quot;
company started , eth@@ ics , values and employees of commitment to 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen has collap@@ sed due to eth@@ ical viol@@ ations of the En@@ ron sc@@ and@@ al , Quin@@ lan said Jes@@ lan .
but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent her dir@@ ty guard online .
&quot; before the use of technology to monitoring the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Gl@@ int as well as Conver@@ cent provide your software as service , and load the company with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to support the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , which both Start @-@ ups have supported .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , leading to the total capital to $ 47 million .
Glit@@ tering Gl@@ ass@@ ed a $ 10 million in November of Better Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly sur@@ prising , in view of the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research that shows that today &apos;s staff are expected more than to date .
highly competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high content and interesting projects only inserts .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and be estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad in a company , feel that their vote is worth being worth it , then they feel better to make this company succe@@ ed , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Conver@@ cent as well as Gl@@ int .
att@@ ained earnings if its portfolio businesses well run . companies run good if staff are dedicated and committed .
if the analy@@ tics Tools will promise third , commitment and use of employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you can find support .
data about the employee &apos;s commitment after the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the treatment of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks associates after your feedback , it may have an anticip@@ ation that change on the way .
and when the change is not fast enough , or not , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments can be bre@@ d and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 calls , you must be ready to have 4,000 con@@ vers@@ ations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen itself too much for collec@@ ting data .
&quot; for if you are not follow , &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ?
do you take care of that ?
and who doesn &apos;t take care of it , why should I ? &quot;
Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , who is now through the monthly staff of monthly surve@@ ys , was able to lead measures on the same day when a problem is reported to gl@@ int .
and after collec@@ ting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was re@@ furb@@ ished by the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , im@@ plant@@ ation , several teams met within the company &apos;s company and to add a communication training to t@@ ack@@ le the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new in@@ sights about the employees , and it h@@ opes that a better eng@@ agement of employees in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not ob@@ li@@ ged to create a culture of transpar@@ ency , you &apos;ll lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then they lose a company .
the cr@@ abs elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the br@@ ine
it goes to 23 , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ads placed on one side of the new exercise fields of the teams on camp@@ us .
some have gone out their tri@@ k@@ oto@@ ber@@ ers and show the back full of shot from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , this in@@ takes minutes a lunch break .
players who are invited to the summer of summer , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise for their aud@@ itors , before they return to the Aqu@@ ag@@ Football Center in the next morning at 6 : 30 a.m .
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday .
it was elim@@ inated two @-@ day exercises to facil@@ itate the load of players , and she has extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three train@@ ings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 hrs to be fully packed in the player .
the com@@ promise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood jo@@ ins the start of Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school during the summer time during Mor@@ as six times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they will be able to hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he should support the change of the c@@ rest , even if they add another point of routes to another point .
&quot; we put these trem@@ end@@ ous stress three or four days on them , and it is very challeng@@ ing , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they just pressed them , they pl@@ ushes up , they are great people .
I think once we have to come until Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end their tra@@ inees , once the camp is finished , what is finished in view of the clear view of its fields and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin center , a hotel of the upper class , which had already been protected with floors , which is no easy task behind .
Bru@@ ins players should use the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ ati@@ ze that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far p@@ icked up to think that people can rent there a room and then take up there to draw a exercise .
if you have the video and a exercise , it is a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I do not make me too big concerns .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants the facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ part of the third and their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on his website , that it will be used with the use of updated machine tut@@ orials , to det@@ ect possible counter@@ part and send them to the fact that may show results of the facsimile examination from the original article .
Facebook was also critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believed to have the U.S. presidential election 2016 .
the problem also has become a major political theme , with the French vot@@ ers in May with wrong stories , and Germany supports a plan to be pun@@ ished by social media networks , if it does not succe@@ ed , h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings like before the elections in September quickly .
on Thursday the Facebook said Facebook in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts will be started .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fact transfers the third parties , people want to make people more context to make known decisions concerning this what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product management for Facebook messages in a blog .
it also added that Facebook continues to be able to explain to the &quot; in conjunction with other changes to his messages , to reduce false messages .
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years a Schl@@ u@@ pf@@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his cozy headquarters in Kent and is now looking for in@@ spiration for a graph@@ ical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ oph@@ a@@ ar@@ igen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; says he we@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England is the time from the Middle A@@ ges to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist , Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ w@@ ic@@ z , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Palmer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on a archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s TE@@ E@@ TH and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that it was un@@ expected emot@@ ionally .
&quot; I just re@@ acted on the th@@ um@@ b pressure on the side of a letter which was written by a double ag@@ ave in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot; he says .
&quot; that is his th@@ um@@ b pressure !
and letters sm@@ ell out after smoke , because he was a fire because of light .
for anyone who lives 300 years later , the sm@@ ell has a effect , as it would be even though .
Oh , I Love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who supported so with old pap@@ al that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months lived in a castle ( &quot; in order to be a little over@@ rated &quot; ) it seems to be nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to study the vi@@ kt@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , like that the mon@@ or@@ tees were spent on walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and ruins of the ancient castle , and spoke with Land@@ scapes , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , nach@@ ts drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the in@@ timate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust only received the full access in 2006 , when the last di@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
as r@@ Rho@@ des a decade later , the staff started to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ o@@ dies said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , who think what poss@@ essed : &quot; it could be bor@@ ing that land conflic@@ ts could be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go through his gear ! &quot;
some of the stories will use the castle as a starting point to spread on a wider basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who left the newly built castle , who left the newly built castle of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tum@@ ult which appeared in 1380 in the castle with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ as@@ ant arose in this area and I thought , a bel@@ lion is a good start .
maybe the two are linked together ? &quot;
other stories are fixed in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ it pat@@ ron that the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers &apos; , shown in the 18th century , who filled his own burial , having filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was made until his Sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the men &apos;s ra@@ ils is to be right to be deb@@ ts and money for things that they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men del@@ etes their training cr@@ ises by using rich women and married - I place them as a bunch well @-@ looking guys , with a tal@@ ent to advert@@ ise Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
after the end of his application in the castle is Rho@@ des on the search for other unique write @-@ experience
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ ash@@ amed mon@@ ks behind it , the site of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has been returned from nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says . &quot;
it was as : &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished with the dam@@ n life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years of old Mari@@ ather@@ elle in R@@ hö@@ n@@ dorf
with the opening of the 301 year old Mari@@ ather@@ elle in R@@ hö@@ n@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday their campaign to launch a new roof mark ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , may@@ or Otto NEW HO@@ FF and his marketing team around Nelson Art@@ z keep the logo and the s@@ log@@ an .
at the end of August , it is a highlight of the campaign to give a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the Ma@@ cher of Action since yesterday at the R@@ hö@@ n@@ dorfer Chapel .
&quot; we think of course ! ) Not really , &quot; write it on her last registered website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make sure that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
the reason we are strong over@@ throw that we know as a bath of Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
in the action to pass more than &quot; only &quot; one logo and a s@@ log@@ an , it is further .
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a distinc@@ tive promise , one that gives the city a distinc@@ tive sens@@ ation time . &quot;
finally , in the competition with other municip@@ alities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost their new umbrella brand and the campaign in Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the Army
every year in early August , Ankara of the Ober@@ ste Military Council ( Y@@ as ) took over pen@@ sions and promot@@ ions in officer .
so this week also .
at the first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session was held no more in the General Staff Building , like earlier , but in the Office of the Prime Minister .
on the consult@@ ations under the government &apos;s headquarters , the five vice @-@ brake , as well as the Minister for Defence , Interior , justice and foreign .
so the civilians were killed in Y@@ as in the Y@@ as .
the government dra@@ ws up the trains at the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force , and the nav@@ y were set out .
since the failed Cou@@ p , Chief of Staff Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Admir@@ als fired .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly due to the alleged connections for the Ex@@ il @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as the Dr@@ ah@@ tz@@ ie@@ ves of the coup .
against 486 people , which had been involved in the coup attempt to be involved in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup had called Erd@@ og@@ an attempt to move the &quot; religious gift , &quot; because he would give him the opportunity to clean the Ar@@ med Forces . &quot;
but is Erd@@ og@@ an the army really in handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ bal@@ ances in the Military headquarters . &quot;
in the general Staff of the army for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which are manif@@ ested in the up@@ lift of the head@@ ch@@ anc@@ ots for solo . he wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the big cleaning of the army and security forces goes further .
in mid @-@ July the Erd@@ og@@ an sent another 73@@ 95 citizen , including 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed to the military to the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times p@@ oured them under appeal to her role as a guard of the world of world .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an entered the power of the military &apos;s power for step , not at appeal to the Re@@ form@@ ations of the European Union .
former officers , Erd@@ og@@ an , aims for an Islam@@ ization of the Ar@@ med Forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; war@@ ned a well @-@ known officer , who sought out the coup attempt of per@@ secution in the abroad of As@@ ylum , the Turkish Army become a few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
this may go to , such a development could not leave the N@@ ato .
in the alliance , there are dou@@ b@@ ts in the alliance with dou@@ b@@ ings of the Turkish army .
ex@@ ecu@@ tives and oper@@ ation@@ als cap@@ abilities were &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he looks forward to reduce the leg@@ ged immig@@ rants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ tly rules for the provision of visa for a long @-@ term working permit and limit@@ ations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and billi@@ ons of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the United States to change the type and way , like the citizens from other countries of Green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chains @-@ migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come from the candidates to support the financial assets to help yourself and knowledge , who will come to our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Department wants to san@@ tur@@ ce track for racing transportation
again , in the past few months over the future of the race @-@ time regime - now it &apos;s going to go quickly .
even before the end of the year , the mar@@ o@@ des route is due to the train station .
in order to secure the future of the race of the race @-@ term , according to the data of the Ministry of the Ministry of Management in this year .
&quot; with the decision to order the circuit Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g further , and to san@@ ieren , the country is especially important for the tourism key , &quot; explained traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the over@@ hau@@ l of the track divi@@ des to approximately 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country will take 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , it is currently defin@@ itive , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train than oper@@ ators are already registered over the technical details .
&quot; these are the ti@@ met@@ able , who used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned agreement between the Ministry of Ministry and railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
the race @-@ st@@ iff @-@ Shuttle will be regular on December 2017 .
the Rac@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is an especially popular platform connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in recent months , we have been tested in the course of a pilot company if the distance is used by sufficient many people to order it again in the future .
the distance is also strong in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of Sex @-@ Rob@@ ots is real , and we should make wor@@ ry about
just as you thought that it can &apos;t be crazy about 2017 , a new report on the techn@@ ological developments in the sex robot .
Yes , indeed .
sex @-@ rob@@ ots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report about the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascent .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its form of breast cancer and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
&quot; the people make it funny , but the company provide every quantity of it , and we will get much more common to see , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key about the publication of its new report .
modern sex bu@@ ffs are developed from their infl@@ ating partners to rob@@ ots with a silicone skin which fe@@ els warm - with consci@@ ous human reactions that can be achieved through the artificial intelligence .
the user can also adap@@ t its rob@@ ots to its conv@@ inc@@ ing , &quot; and they are all select , from the eye colour of the robot via the form of breast cancer to the type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ail .
but it will still be troubled when many rob@@ ots are &quot; person@@ alities &quot; who would make a Step@@ ford @-@ wife progressive .
modern sex bu@@ ffs are developed to rob@@ ots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Botan@@ ix robot allows for example to adap@@ t its users to adap@@ t their rob@@ ots to the characteristics that they find appe@@ aling as the so@@ ber .
and then there &apos;s still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; giving the impression of not@@ ori@@ ental and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; dis@@ cour@@ age &quot; person@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a person@@ ality to help your person@@ ality as good as possible , &quot; sw@@ im the site of True Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so do you like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day , they even has her voice - quite as real people !
it can be ti@@ red , fixed on con@@ vers@@ ational or her can be &quot; in mo@@ ods &quot; ! &quot;
there are many troubled aspects in this ascent of sex rob@@ ots - not least because they re@@ placing real human relation@@ ships , but the uns@@ cre@@ ations of r@@ ape , when you get a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : contra@@ sting ) Far@@ rah , be@@ un@@ quiet a most of the most .
on his website True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the site .
however , this sex @-@ rob@@ ots are not only a fet@@ ish , or just a different sex game .
their emer@@ gence and their increasing oil refin@@ es on a little dark and lo@@ wering of our culture , to a withdraw@@ al of ideal of equality of the sex@@ es , after sex with sub@@ mission as optional addition .
most men , of course , have no sex rob@@ ots , and while the FR@@ R is increasing its increasing popular@@ ity , they remain on the edge of the consumer culture .
but what is gone out of the Rand@@ z@@ ons , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or stran@@ gl@@ ed , until they are subject to the free market for this permission .
there is yet a certain over@@ throw that this highly developed sex rob@@ ots in a period , in which the rights of women are threatened , in which there are a pre@@ sidents who has become pr@@ inc@@ t , women with sex@@ ually attacked .
the aw@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos; s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graph@@ ical images that affects the sw@@ imm@@ ed body , but as realistic these vision .
the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a jump , but at the moment it fe@@ els like a great jump .
the goal behind this sex robot is that there is a physical simil@@ ar@@ ity to actual women so realistic as techn@@ ically possible ( if also with Por@@ nost@@ ar propor@@ tions ) .
her bow@@ yers want to feel the movement of a real body .
but it was brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robot will not const@@ itute a real women .
they can &apos;t separate from their compan@@ ions or simply away .
they have no conf@@ usion or background , nothing , what happens to independence or anything , what the imag@@ ination must inter@@ rupt the imag@@ ination .
differ@@ ently , you are pleas@@ ing sl@@ aves .
or to press it in the Re@@ de@@ wise from 2017 : service powers
Tr@@ um@@ ps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to hold the healthy human rights
it has become a binary era of tr@@ ump era that the political strug@@ gles which have to have the US vot@@ ers , which have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ onian was there in the USA newspapers , with advice about it , how to go with the hor@@ ror of tr@@ ump of tr@@ ump .
we strict all supp@@ os@@ edly to put our filter blow .
less not@@ ices have been power tr@@ um@@ ps , families together .
I have chosen this because my co@@ usin , a left @-@ related poet , who lives in Chicago , and has visited this week in New York that week .
she remin@@ ded me that the unity can have a mighty effect against a common enemy .
with tr@@ ump in the White house , everyone who knows them , including the Repub@@ lican transformation , with which they fought against the decade due to politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side .
in order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls in another context that this is also considerable risk with itself .
the Left was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the effect of his pre@@ sidency , the power to shoot us all after the right .
if we speak of &quot; normal@@ ization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cru@@ el possibility that his le@@ bs can &apos;t be cast out of one day .
however , there is still a long @-@ time long @-@ time scenario , in the tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alised &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards , suddenly appe@@ aling to his standards .
I find me today with a active p@@ im@@ neys for Mit@@ t Rom@@ neys ( but at least , at least , as at least , we had seen how his tax declaration saw ) - which both occur in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact , in fact , as a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when tr@@ ump passes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be spiritu@@ ally healthy , to qualif@@ y for itself as an unknown improvement .
when my co@@ usin in the city was , we brought to our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ us@@ ehold &apos;s New York Business Division , and the best three dollars that can be found in the city , if you need no caff@@ eine needed .
the horses are enormous large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs at the central cylinder - all C@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ red and the animals are turning to look full of their own sh@@ oul@@ ders - extremely fin@@ ster and the k@@ lim@@ per@@ ing music , to perc@@ ei@@ ve this in not@@ able manner .
so many small c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appointed : the views of high buildings become old , the Sk@@ ylin@@ es become too familiar to offer much exc@@ it@@ ement , and the reality of the city will not be just@@ ified .
five @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not yet over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not one of the Swiss Cottage - the subjects @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , since here two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old you can walk and all have a great time .
if I could have written the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him a full score , but fortunately no one has asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to evalu@@ ate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before being able to pass through my credit card .
in the coffee shop at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the cargo .
this is not just a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also invol@@ ve pressure on the server , to do person@@ ality into a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman at the department store was terri@@ fic , while I ti@@ red the experience to submit my credit card using five stars .

Software update for diesel vehicles : what do those affected have to know
how precisely is the software update instead ?
need diesel drivers to participate in the action ?
the main questions and answers in an overview .
in the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates for around 5.3 million cars in total .
you should have to improve the emission of cars of the emissions release Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or poor are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ ine by ACE Auto Club Europe are ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the collected software updates are optional .
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates before , only for vehicles , the Schuman software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
their subsequent installation has arranged the KRA@@ FT@@ FA@@ HRT @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when , customers will be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a gener@@ ous implementation in the next months but no exact date is called .
Daimler has shared , everyone affected the affected .
if you be due to an inspection , it will be immer@@ sed in their context .
how long does the gra@@ de@@ parts go up altogether ?
&quot; heavy to say , &quot; Wo@@ unded S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the curtains of the commitment of the manufacturers , as well as from political printing .
&quot; because we have seen volun@@ tar@@ ily surren@@ der the car manufacturers at the subject of Environment . &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the conversion itself could last in the workshop only three to four hours .
if you could be able to get an appointment .
what do car driver who do not drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE det@@ ain@@ ted .
probably , foreign manufacturers would follow , so s@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid .
but , in the regions , where passengers are threatened .

we make the city life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to Ren@@ te next year .
the place is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are however r@@ ar .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister since 31 years .
and the work is still great fun , as he used in the press conference .
he reported varied , but challeng@@ ing tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , wonder don &apos;t bid to fill the required profile profile .
the city looks for the next time of a architects or building engineer .
so , - under review of regular cancellation periods - still enough time for a development .
since Has@@ lach was appointed for the administration of administration as a sub@@ e Building authority , the application must be presented .
because this function wants to keep the city on every case .
if you cannot fill this no longer , the citizens would have to drive out until Off@@ enburg .
but civil war is the city and himself also important , says W@@ acker that tells of a good operating li@@ ma as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years , some important projects have accum@@ ulated , based on the t@@ acker with pri@@ de .
&quot; we make the city of life , &quot; he is about the building of building and his staff safe .
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : re@@ mod@@ elling of former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ ckey parking space is approximately .
the Kin@@ z@@ ig@@ brücke between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject .
with some 1.5 million euros , the latter is going to be@@ ech about 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we make it right , &quot; it is ro@@ cket .
&quot; everything in all wait great tasks on my successor .
the work is fun . &quot;
the design is present to a town center of large play@@ room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s , its own building yard and gar@@ dener could be quite flexi@@ bly re@@ acted on many occas@@ ions .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; so w@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will be often marked out of citizens and visitors .
since the old town is under mem@@ orial protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for this what is clean , &quot; if new super@@ structures will be approved , emphas@@ ized the de@@ struc@@ tor of the de@@ grad@@ ation .
ohn@@ eh@@ in carries the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister high responsibility .
he is a building , &quot; at the end it runs along my table here . &quot;
in support and coordin@@ ation , he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( High construction ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schö@@ ner ( Grav@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years .
also , that his successor is too long , W@@ acker : &quot; we &apos;re looking for someone who really identified with the place . &quot;
for continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating li@@ ma , but also for the further design of the city .
those who want to know Roland W@@ acker , should be closed after information of the City Has@@ lach , which can be not@@ ice@@ able as a diplom@@ atic engineer or Bachelor in the fields of construction and construction conditions in the fields of construction and construction conditions .
the municipal office under@@ stands high @-@ quality and dr@@ en@@ bau , building planning , Gr@@ under@@ scores , urban operating areas with building yard and municipal law , as well as Unter@@ e Building authority including thinking protection .
bike on lines thrown : Süd@@ bahn@@ track closed
according to the police , the blue bicycle was thrown by the railway station of the railway station in the Le@@ o@@ das Road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were bad@@ ly damaged , that the her@@ b@@ ance goods had to be returned .
the investig@@ ators go from two male val@@ leys and are looking for the night hours after them .
near the Tat@@ ort , there were witnesses to a ros@@ ar@@ oter roller and a bike rider .
&quot; that is far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ is , &quot; Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch said to AP@@ A .
the per@@ pet@@ rators were killed in great danger , even to end@@ ang@@ ered the train .
in addition to the har@@ m of the Lok and the plant , as well as the delay and cost of rail@@ road traffic could also be p@@ ön@@ al of the rail@@ ways to the val@@ leys .
a total of up to a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the speaker said .
the damage were fixed on Friday afternoon , the train traffic on the south track could be guided without dis@@ abilities .
nearly ten person@@ alities were Friday morning , two of them looked at the correspondence .
freight wag@@ ons were not made , but they had del@@ ayed delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to ex@@ changed some 200 meters of the upper section .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have been damaged .
red meat , milk products and chocolate could help , I@@ BD ( flamm@@ able int@@ ents ) to lin@@ ers
red meat and chocolate can be used for your digest@@ ive system such as a night@@ mare .
but a new study claimed to the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and da@@ iry products , the symptoms could handle patients with anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory bow@@ ls .
the un@@ healed state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000 , causing magic and blo@@ od@@ ings , recur@@ ring or blo@@ ody break@@ down , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the affected normally , meat and milk products to avoid their symptoms were found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an has been developing the immune cells that promote an toler@@ ant Dar@@ m .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that the immune cells in the Dar@@ m pat@@ rol , to ensure that harm@@ ful micro@@ ben to hide themselves in the body , not in the body .
cells , which are im@@ plant@@ able , inflamm@@ ations are dis@@ rup@@ tible by cells , and protect the tolerance and protect the body , without sensitive tissue .
if the balance is incl@@ ined in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it may cause an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory surgery .
in experiments we found that a kind of tolerance convey@@ ing imm@@ unity in mice lead to con@@ se@@ ated a particular bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ atives .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that carry the tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an had the mice in their food , the more they had the immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ant , less inflamm@@ atory mil@@ ie@@ us if the same system is conf@@ used for people .
the Post@@ dok@@ tor@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an analys@@ ed a kind of immun@@ o@@ ids such as they found out that a group of study powers such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was separated from that was not found .
they thought that the difference is to do with the int@@ est@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ble of the mice had the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms , which normally live in the stomach Dar@@ m Tra@@ ins .
the D@@ är@@ me of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacter@@ ial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without they were missing in mice .
mice were mounted in an ster@@ ing surrounding , so that they did not have an int@@ est@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ om , and they were not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria sent to the immune system , the researchers used L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid , and carried out small quantities of liquid - without the bacter@@ ial cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed up to the toler@@ ated cells .
as the active component of the liquid is clean@@ ed , it proved to be a secondary product of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an @-@ met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells were hal@@ ved around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people are the same toler@@ ant promot@@ ing cells such as mice , and protect the most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i to our stomach traction .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an @-@ side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i have found the cells in humans as well as mice , but def@@ ects in gen@@ ds in relation to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an were found in humans with anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory diseases .
she said , &quot; The development of this cells is probably something that we would like to promote these cells inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the Dar@@ ms .
potenti@@ ally can result high tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an values in present from L. reu@@ ter@@ i to a extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ inho believes that Manchester United with Nem@@ an@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
in Manchester United States , M@@ atic has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius , &quot; believed Jose Mo@@ ur@@ inho , after the middle of the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening he had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pound of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Cup Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressive in a holder role as people as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Pereira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the bl@@ ues in the bl@@ ues , and only 45 minutes to improve Mo@@ ur@@ inho , that he had to improve Mo@@ ur@@ inho before the beginning of the Premier League @-@ season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the kind , as he th@@ inks - he th@@ inks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ inho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready as later as later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic start@@ led Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u at the A@@ vi@@ va stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ inho his start @-@ XI started the start of the season .
the In@@ dependent appeared in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ inho also wish three more new liabilities , but it existed on that the club has already been a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to ful@@ fil three of its four priority accounts .
&quot; three of four to get there , thank you for the club , &quot; added .
&quot; I will be happy if they get four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ hou@@ ette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots fle@@ w from Seattle , in U.S. state of Washington , the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved into the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , that are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the wheel bre@@ ll@@ as was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a permanent test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising earlier than earlier .
so the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new dr@@ ills for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as though the wind revol@@ ves ever : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , Socialist and democratic Prime Minist@@ ers before the elections are always present with a certain conc@@ ern after Berlin .
only dis@@ order from the part@@ ing centre , blo@@ wer no counter@@ wind from the covenant , so is the most important part of the vot@@ ers .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , it has changed considerably .
since then , staff members from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing disposal in the SPD govern@@ ed state capit@@ als .
since the beginning of the year , Schulz has been described there since the beginning of the year , with back@@ wind cannot be described in the base .
there were dr@@ ills .
and one after the other .
after the sur@@ prising end of red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Green Party .
&quot; this is the basis of more : red @-@ green , it can simply rely reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber on the Editor network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the sur@@ prising fac@@ tional extraction of a Green MP@@ s has short@@ ened the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the country &apos;s end , his red @-@ green co@@ alition lost their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Managing Director Michael Keller has been asked to release the Lower Saxony @-@ member of El@@ ke Twe@@ els to return to their mand@@ ate .
the transition to CD@@ U means a clear ver@@ ification of vot@@ ers .
El@@ ke Twe@@ sten immediately returned her mand@@ ate , &quot; said the Federal President and Ele@@ ction of the Green Editor of the Green editor Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; this may not be true , if it is not true , the SPD vot@@ er turn@@ eth out that the new Hi@@ th@@ ank@@ s@@ Message reached the party centre in the Friday morning .
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the tak@@ e@@ over of the Green MP@@ s El@@ ke Twe@@ et for CD@@ U without own government majority .
it is the provis@@ ional highlight of a whole range of large and small cr@@ ises in the SPD regional associations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ cellaneous started with un@@ expect@@ edly defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the com@@ rade par@@ ent .
everything will be different differ@@ ently after landing elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
it was then - and indeed , everything was worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into t@@ aum@@ burg , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party smooth .
eff@@ ort@@ able up the com@@ rad@@ es in the weeks after that .
then when she had exhau@@ sted the new cour@@ age , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next dr@@ ills came .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD landscape sho@@ re@@ ef lost his Nim@@ bus because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ y while his city burned .
and because he had taken everything wrong in the crisis of Kr@@ is@@ enk@@ omm@@ unications , something that can be wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so now Stephan W@@ eil now .
due to the VW exhaust aff@@ air and its role in the super@@ visory board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been involved in the critic@@ ism of the critic@@ ism .
Mi@@ ese Re@@ fr@@ age@@ values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps this is why , W@@ eil tried even stronger in the last weeks , in the case of acc@@ ents .
the fun@@ eral of the former civil war of Hanover , his power in Berlin , remained not hid in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they sent him to grant a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now , the exact opposite could enter .
W@@ eil meets W@@ eil at the part@@ s@@ log@@ an , the Lower Saxony is no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz will not say .
the com@@ rad@@ es inv@@ ades the com@@ rad@@ es that is closed in its own rows .
their anger is proud to the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the back@@ sliding par@@ li@@ aments .
&quot; it is in@@ comprehen@@ sible and dem@@ ocrac@@ ies , such as wife Twe@@ sten her own career about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Party in the SPD parliamentary group , the editor network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. Twe@@ sten has not been elected for their person as a direct connection , but on the state of the Lower Saxony Parliament , the Lower Saxony Comm@@ ons had been elected .
the logical consequences would be back to its mand@@ ate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , pro@@ claim a &quot; und@@ em@@ ocratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ ers of four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan W@@ eil as a prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who led the Lower Saxony SPD as a pre@@ sidency in the Bundestag .
&quot; now the personal career of a future of CD@@ U MP@@ s did pursu@@ ing the elections , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , &quot; said again .
he ordered to clar@@ ify the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or more detailed presentation of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
Convey@@ ing capacity for Ort@@ is@@ ers III
if you want to rent his home in the years , you can get back support from the country .
in addition , the may@@ or Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ST@@ EC urban development on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave up a review to the previous year .
since 1991 it has been working in emp@@ lified san@@ itation regions .
at that time , in the san@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country was acquired two @-@ third of the funding amount .
at least 60 percent in the san@@ itation area II from 2005 to 2016 , there was at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the present san@@ iz@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , and not only new construction areas .
on April 4 , we received the information that there will be a renovation area in Karlsruhe .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euros , of which would come 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the comm@@ une .
how is a renovation area now ?
one will continue to exam@@ ine Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it is also a role in the planned area at all interest , to san@@ ieren .
in any case , the territory cannot move again .
the ST@@ EC laying on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the content of the federal government programme &quot; Social Forum , &quot; in whose framework the san@@ itation would be carried out .
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner city , impro@@ ving the quality of the residential and working conditions and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be obj@@ ected , that is , is carried out by the property .
the san@@ itation area would then be established as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for funding is scheduled for January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 2026 .
however , until September of this year , however , the inventory will only be carried out , as part of those who received quest@@ ionn@@ aire subjects a quest@@ ionn@@ aire .
in November or December , if possible , before the pro@@ position of the pro@@ position , this year can be started with the san@@ itation in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every comm@@ une comm@@ une the pre@@ paid pre@@ y investig@@ ations .
it is to evalu@@ ate the urban characteristics and decide to decide when renovated and in which circum@@ ference .
it will also be registered for the respective property and entered a renovation work in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after emp@@ ties and make a picture of the location , she said .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ized , a significant success factor for the project was the participation of the participation .
therefore , the quest@@ ionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the next weeks PO@@ STA@@ L@@ ISCH , and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow quest@@ ionn@@ aire is the &quot; Building and plot se@@ quest@@ ionn@@ aire , &quot; where it is among others about the bau@@ ble state and the san@@ itation views .
in the grey Quest@@ ionn@@ aire , the &quot; household of household and housing , &quot; can be done to the size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room .
the blue &quot; road blade &quot; is only to fill out when buildings are operated .
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a quest@@ ionn@@ aire was not at the same time as a request for funding .
new construction measures are not operational .
Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of funding from the &quot; wind @-@ dog principle &quot; work - who comes first comes , m@@ ahl@@ t first .
you could not make a spon@@ sor@@ ship for later . &quot;
in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ is@@ ers II &quot; were shown to make the appro@@ aching a renovation . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first one in the country that can open with a micro chip , to enter his household and even with a manual movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the wind@@ y chip between th@@ um@@ bs and po@@ ems , offering the service for companies and individuals who want to simp@@ lif@@ y their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined by Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ er an@@ aest@@ hes@@ es in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant process is carried out after medical standard .
the technology res@@ em@@ bles a cats and dogs are im@@ pressed micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also would like to change the locks to houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .

the promotional cost of the low house costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event that increases the U.S. manufacturing in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military , which were transferred to the TIME Magazin , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Navy One , when the president on board was abo@@ ard , the heart of the event was on July 17th in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and conduc@@ ting officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .

the military office of the White House demanded the presence of helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ ile order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for operation of helicop@@ ter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware , because it is an ordinary event with high vis@@ ibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the eve of its predecessor , the Deputy Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ ure for aviation .
the message showed that the helicop@@ ter was on 17 July at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long remained until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 arrived on this evening .
NOTE that , if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to restri@@ ction of the service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the helicop@@ ter during the time during the security personnel of the unit during the time on the plane .
out of the TIME included records , it wasn &apos;t clearly stated if the second flight crew was necessary .
the Hatch Act passed the federal own@@ ership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 would be asked if the event could mean the determination .
&quot; a question that we introduced , whether it was a viol@@ ation of the Hatch acts acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds like if you are closed , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was discovered by the White House as official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have a political upper part .
at the event , President decided to reform the reform of health Reform , which was in the Senate , and he prop@@ elled the efforts to sett@@ le government regulations .
the use of the plane , which is known as Navy One or Air Force , is hardly a new phenom@@ enon .
pre@@ sidents are ob@@ li@@ ged to use them for the trip .
but not for use only for a photo @-@ OP , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft in front of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services and his Twitter account is full of messages that attri@@ butes to its predecessor by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is exc@@ ited from the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Commander of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations lead frequently training flights in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn by the US President in the White House with precise centi@@ met@@ ers@@ .
as a Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was carried out in the White House 58 .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted a civil rights for the month , said a civil servants .
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flo@@ wn in addition to this day for &quot; non @-@ pre@@ sidency support . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ threw the burden for no of the other request , which were presented at the event .
a speaker of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company has not been involved in the South @-@ La@@ wn helicop@@ ter .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 doesn &apos;t have bud@@ get@@ ed drawings for presidential flights , and it &apos;s difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ entar@@ if@@ ies of the Ministry of Defense in 2017 , the Do@@ D revenue set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D but 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit sign the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House arg@@ uments that the actual costs for the operation of the helicop@@ ter is far below this rate .
&quot; the costs for tax@@ pay@@ ers based on the basis of the estimates , is highly real , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the equipment for Do@@ D does not contain the personnel costs , but consider the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of helicop@@ ter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week , which are manufactured in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Conn@@ ecti@@ cut very proud that they are at our national safety , and I go from that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on .
and I think , as most of the Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have un@@ ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
it &apos;s natural to fix this . &quot;
it was not clear that Tr@@ ump with the helicop@@ ter inter@@ acted as he had his branch over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
at the White House , Tr@@ ump on representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ sle@@ ek with the media over its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

in any case , team chef Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay , has respect the opp@@ onents .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays in quite similar formation .

for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , mainly imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dane and Finn@@ s can also refer to entries in the Davis Cup .

&quot; this will always be difficult for us .
there you need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ o@@ er Team for the Trip in the High north is convenient .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could be Maxime Jan@@ vier .
it does not score at the Ch@@ all@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man in Italian Bi@@ ella , comes from the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec , Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at its first use in this season .
the so far un@@ defeated Hans Pod@@ li@@ p@@ nik @-@ Cast@@ illo was yesterday with the Weiß@@ rus@@ sian An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .

after his two victories on the past Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also move again into the team .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the jun@@ ior cat@@ fish list , not , f@@ ills any one from the training starting at Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay the K@@ ader .

in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons stand for his choice .
&quot; the press &quot; has viewed that the Group could destroy , and could really hate him .

the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita lunch break itself again .
with fixed response partners for the children and a refuge for the team .
the clock is turned back to the urban kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens .
on the 1st of September , the town of Kre@@ feld will take over the Es@@ sens@@ ation in the urban kinder@@ g@@ utter facilities ( Kit@@ as ) in the town of Kre@@ feld .
for Son@@ ja Pomm@@ er@@ anz , dep@@ uty chief manager in the field of youth help , this is a good news : &quot; we have all very pleased . &quot;

the city runs in the area of 46 children &apos;s kinder@@ garten , in 44 children to the lun@@ ch@@ time of a warm meal .
last kit@@ ten years , 2800 children have grown to the tables , and the need is growing stead@@ ily .

&quot; they have a well known strength in the K@@ ita , one person who tru@@ sts in them , and not continuously changeable people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the cul@@ mination of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as the task of c@@ aster - will be pre@@ ached in the future of spe@@ ar@@ able cleaning cases .
this version - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service , has also the charm of quality improvement in the kitchen , which it is set out in cost equal to the city as the most economic , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; but these hours falling at around 750 people in the yield area even so strongly into the weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pomm@@ er@@ anz .

G@@ MB owners of invest@@ ing in Mc@@ Vit@@ ie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union wants to develop his production commitment at the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s long @-@ term commitment to the production in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company weigh over the future of investments in the rab@@ bit site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which includes other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that people and trade union representatives were &quot; first experienced , if they would change their activities .
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; concerns to external sales that financing is not pre @-@ powered by production lines . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win from General @-@ sit@@ em@@ ulation to the future needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ bit , affects our members .
generations of families have been working here and labour force , strongly focused on the local community and the large @-@ room Glasgow , an important pillar of human dig@@ nation in an area with high unemployment and social notification .
therefore , under the perspective of work@@ stations , the wage and the well @-@ being , and before the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of life and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow had ur@@ gently need a fl@@ oral production at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch manager at Toll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will be re@@ acting directly on it since we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross , where some questions were open .
we discuss the staff , that we are like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic li@@ ma , our business is ongoing - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to competitive more competitive .
you added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognize the inheritance of rab@@ bit as a production facilities and quite at . if our business processes will change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona has war@@ ned three years ago ?
page of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not neg@@ lec@@ ted in its per@@ secution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , in order to dis@@ solve its release of £ 189 million , but they were war@@ ned in Barcelona before the world record three years ago ?
the sens@@ ational approach has set the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Club is ready to break the world record more than double the previous brand , whereas Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season .
after the completion of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is the world &apos;s most expensive professional athl@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is gr@@ ass@@ ing over the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has its way back to without , although a source is given close to the Catal@@ an officer that the club has always been given to care of the club since its arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but the soccer world was war@@ ned by the PS@@ G pre@@ sidency before this pro@@ spect ?
when Manchester City will be interested in the signing of Bl@@ aise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club to sign one of the best player in PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not bes@@ ought , because they know that if they are able to touch one of our player , we will call them in opposition to them , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if it try to sign a player of our player , this is consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Central field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G did not allow that they would not allow it to be able to travel to the International from Italy , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interpretation , having lost their price for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report &quot; dra@@ ws Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the author and hist@@ orian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report for the Miss@@ ing sc@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to discussions .
Christian Weis@@ n@@ der , spokes@@ man of the Re@@ formation Movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained by the previous Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ itus Pope Benedict XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the view of the Catholic Church very serve , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would make its deep@@ est re@@ gre@@ t about their own eyes , or their then false estim@@ ation of the processes would fail .
the Vatican law &quot; O@@ ss@@ erv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; in contrast , however , critic@@ ized that during the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen using &quot; two @-@ di@@ vers measures . &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one that prev@@ ents &quot; ri@@ bbon and damaged de@@ eds &quot; will have to be pun@@ ished , but the &quot; degree medi@@ al man@@ ip@@ ulation , &quot; so the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the rel@@ atives to draw the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is part of the everyday life experience and preparing the public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Für@@ st@@ in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; it is pleased to go on the church and that is a very low fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
in addition , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; saw a quite normal agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are un@@ fair , today &apos;s standards on earlier decade , because the world have changed .
in connection with the reports about the fail@@ ures , Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger was often used .
completely un@@ law@@ ful , author and hist@@ orian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who compiled with R@@ atz@@ inger at the Rem@@ embr@@ ance &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; evaluated the results of final report .
what is exactly what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report written by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the declaration of Att@@ orney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were killed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high density &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sex@@ ually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg , &quot; sum@@ mar@@ ized that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of forms of physical and psych@@ ological violence .
just at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ism , the pun@@ ishment of the pupils could also be f@@ ain@@ ted with severe E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ism .
nevertheless , in contrast to many other accused , many victims of the general religion of R. inspec@@ ted and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even positive memories .
in an interview , H@@ es@@ emann , why the final report for the Miss@@ ing s@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion after de@@ ceased .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages long report about the incid@@ ents of violent attacks at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for the one , many students raise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
for the other , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ect@@ ants , who became a regular service when a domain rate had no top performance .
how do you have to report this report publishing date ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read the effort and all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask , why the name is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at all in it .
just eight pages is dedicated , and it is significantly acqu@@ itted of every sus@@ pic@@ ion of the Mitt@@ ens or mit@@ igation against the aw@@ ful cases of sexual ab@@ use .
the violence in front of the school was also outside of its effec@@ tiveness .
one can re@@ throw him , of which too late or were not serious enough to have taken enough .
the cathedral @-@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ us , based on which he became real , was practi@@ cally all respon@@ dents as - so liter@@ ally - &quot; re@@ dem@@ ption , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also represents an excellent report , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the boys regularly comes with cakes , cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always of grapes from children . &quot;
only a min@@ ority is worth a min@@ ority about his PER@@ FE@@ C@@ TION@@ ISM and its high emot@@ ional , which led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages even too .
that he did not only tell the chairs and the key words , but also ear@@ ning spread to the hair , or ear , he has appro@@ ached to the hair or ears , he himself wor@@ th@@ ed themselves before years ago .
in his honour , however , there must be said that such drawing methods in the survey time , the 1960s and 1970s , widely spread , with parents as at teachers .
do you know even such breeding methods ?
of course , I think anyone of us who was born in 1968 .
I also have experienced that even in a worldwide school , experienced a state @-@ Gymnasium .
compared to that , in order to be in this report , namely , the implementation of sexual ab@@ use and violence at the pre@@ school , the fre@@ il@@ ich Bag@@ at@@ elles .
since it is question@@ ed , whether there is no more likely to do with his conf@@ usion and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fell on him .
in the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him , still ei@@ fri@@ g .
but the truth is : the report was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report was reported very much about the topic ab@@ use at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also some p@@ addle or co @-@ ordin@@ ance with regard to sexual ab@@ use ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clear no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual survi@@ ving claims to have ru@@ sted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were con@@ se@@ cr@@ ated .
&quot; I have never conf@@ ess to talk with my father or my mother , &quot; said one of the people , &quot; It was me everything very much . &quot;
the true problem with the explanation of sexual ab@@ use was , and yet it is that most victims from shame are silent .
if they did not commit their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then it was definitely not a cho@@ ir@@ master , who would have been working as a colle@@ ague of the per@@ pet@@ rators .
how did the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Student R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers Role in terms of the ab@@ use cases ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a quest@@ ionn@@ aire form@@ ulated so : &quot; concerning sexual ab@@ use ... I see ... no case , in which he had been calculated ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have been able to maintain the particular per@@ pet@@ rators .
I keep it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , assume that it looked after him ... Bu@@ ben ein@@ urg@@ ent or cle@@ ar@@ er or rather open , as opposed to their parents , boarding conduc@@ tors , confi@@ denti@@ sts etc .
with him over sex says ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
thus , the report about the very clear result : &quot; that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of sexual ab@@ use , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is fre@@ igh@@ ted from any compet@@ ence .
so it cannot be accused of him , not prev@@ ents or to display .
hence , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contra@@ dic@@ ally crimes in conjunction , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
in the media was a lot of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the report &quot; Weg@@ ener &quot; was accused &quot; by the previous Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
do he have to live with this life ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the reporting , everything was mixed and avo@@ ided to a giant mel@@ ange from sexual ab@@ use and violent ex@@ alted , and somewhere in the middle of dr@@ ama Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
there will be clean separately : between the pre@@ school and high school of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual ab@@ use and violence as well as we say , rest of the other .
in addition , the report from the time has been treated from the time since 1945 , so that Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not Ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful test mat@@ ters , cases of cases of s@@ adi@@ st@@ ical teachers are regul@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ s , and among them , en@@ acted all of them at the fore@@ stry in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sk@@ ies have to have prev@@ ail@@ ed .
but with whom , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he received the boys on her face when she had already been on the cathedral @-@ grade @-@ gramm@@ ar school .
on that , as most of the most witnesses came , the subject &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; school . &quot;
it was only happy to come to be and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ em@@ ic &quot; states .
what was different on the domain @-@ grade gramm@@ ar school ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was a discipl@@ ine , but there is no s@@ adi@@ st@@ ical violence .
and this applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of the general war of R. inspec@@ ted and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
it remains at most of the design that looks away .
however , in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two time periods , in which it was reported by the circumstances on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself , and from the v@@ int@@ ages to a school which he was not effective and responsible , ( so the witness ) would not hear , and then it was back in 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger completed his ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium , which even re@@ produced its report .
in this point he indicates that in the pre@@ school , the test penalty would continue to be pract@@ ised . &quot;
already in view of neg@@ ative press release , he ur@@ gently need to int@@ end .
that was of course at a time , as a legal clarity , which were forbidden to be pro@@ hib@@ ited in Bavaria .
before that she was in a leg@@ ally grey zone , like everyone from us still knows .
there was also difficult for him , where those affected might be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ at@@ ised , where really the ad@@ missible border was exceeded .
but it cannot say that he would have been sw@@ allowed away .
it is not true .
only in 1980 , the test sentence was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Für@@ st@@ in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to use today &apos;s educational standards on the then time .
how do you see that ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we speak hist@@ ori@@ ans from the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of past to present mor@@ al measure after today &apos;s mor@@ al .
there has been the prin@@ cip@@ ality in law .
but that &apos;s not , of course , not for sexual ab@@ use , who was dis@@ continued at all times , and not for that which was interrup@@ ted in the pre@@ school and violence against inno@@ cent children , that is already far beyond that time .
this is all terri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally finished .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all that had nothing to do with him .
its funds to discipl@@ inary and pun@@ ishment , thus ear@@ posts and spread to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as physical pun@@ ishment , then it was forbidden to be pro@@ hib@@ ited .
what is the picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the discussions with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
came the topic test for the language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it goes to the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are only a supporting role .
nevertheless , I still ref@@ rained from the way that he led there a stric@@ tly reg@@ iment .
but this also has to be said : without these PER@@ FE@@ C@@ TION@@ IS@@ M@@ US , without the un@@ cond@@ itional discipl@@ ine , it would be hardly possible to go from that until then , the true cultural am@@ bassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you can now make no big sing@@ ers and before any success , equal to what area , but always discipl@@ ine , passion and self @-@ negoti@@ ation .
as what a man did you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in her book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and always again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous and warm people , from which you can not imagine , that he could not allow me only a fly .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still comes today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly come to him , visit him , he is almost blind - and him as a member of her family .
those who are not for@@ given to him today , that he was once stric@@ tly to them , are clearly in the min@@ ority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are currently th@@ ank@@ ful to him today that he en@@ ri@@ ched their lives and brought them the world of the music .
and that he is always a good , blessed teacher - a str@@ enger father , certain , that may be , but also a lov@@ able respec@@ t@@ sper@@ son , to which they still rise again , and to dev@@ our them again .
and please , even once again : all that you th@@ rows it , are ex@@ pressing methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad , that we have been running this time .
but it &apos;s highest un@@ just , a man only because he is well @-@ promin@@ ent and a promin@@ ent brother , to the medi@@ al sin@@ ners .
there is the evil inten@@ tion that stands behind it , only too obviously .
because the report , which was just published , dra@@ ws him .
now the association would be acquired , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired a great member and without the outside of Bay@@ ern@@ s and perhaps there is no man to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen in peace .
