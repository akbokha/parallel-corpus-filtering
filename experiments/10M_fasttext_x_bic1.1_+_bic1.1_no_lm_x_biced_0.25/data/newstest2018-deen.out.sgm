<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your eyes to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An irren shades, where they are subject to a youth.</seg>
<seg id="3">A salary chapel, where is excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners contributable to the former foundation of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">The knoweth everyone who had to be repeated twice, because the car-Navi takes place instead of a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently, but now is very happy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, as cities and municipalities in the neighbourhood area of Munich has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickcarpet to recognize one as such as such as such as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large supervisory board, towns and municipalities have been collaborated for cities and municipalities in detail, so-called Urposition sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian State Treaty between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement of the Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Army Guide occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Napoleon you wish an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns into order - of course of course.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even when the French troops entered the Lunéville's peace of 9 February, 1801 there were today's neighbours that created the idea of an extensive Bavaria-card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thereby the Bavarian State Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urselsblatt for Munich is born in 1856 and is like all the other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of fruit / today is the example of the state capital at the most oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded into all directions and has grown to all directions.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after creation of the card, i.e. 1877, when the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Underground are located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses subsends focus around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Executive Board of the Bavarian farmers in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing as fields - at the first glance: when a single-small card appears with dutzing lines and numbers: handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called "Urphoto," out of the cornerstone.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, at 1810 Schaufplatz, was in the 19th century, actually a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historic card gives insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urselsblatt, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen just reads the street name "at the Gasteig" or of the "height" on the fans "- but also in large letters" irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield Road to unlocked people with waking orders.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59, the Munich Region-Irrenanstalt was created on the Auer fans. "</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment of the psychiatrist, which was brought into the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and finished for example the suit of the so-called irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has taught the staff, violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">First of 280 patients was first place, then it was expanded to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity is not enough - the reason for the construction of the county of Kreisirrenanstalt in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatry in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the area of former Austrians, young people met in the Munich Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and emigrated to a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">Located west of the TSV Munich Ost, east residential homes from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was established in architectural bureaureation of the origins of the Irish War, which had been destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was in 1856 as "Head Square," the department of Kaufingerstraße was "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought a decisive change in the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allied risk opened in December 1944, many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big stayed until today - on Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a salary chapel from the Middle Ages were once approved at the Marienhof, where those days are working and will take place on April 5, 2017 at the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn.</seg>
<seg id="49">Remove the old Munich-map with the airpicture of today and fill up the hole to the Marienhof at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights published Travel Guide for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for promotion of color has issued a warning for colored people who travel on discriminating politics and the rapid attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Service for the Federal State of Missouri, will be appearing in force by August 28, 2017, propose a number of fragrances, terrace-based lectures in the last time in the entire state and here," it is written in the position of opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes people heavier to win discrimination on minorities, as well as the prosecution of the state, as well as the disclaiming the group called the journey, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the civil rights to pass through people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are attached to their skin colors, they are merged or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we will hear such as a frequency, which we don't have heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has exhibited the organisation for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted as rapid consistencies against black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol longer, and was accused by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime of crimes.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report by Missouri's Office of Missouri, in which black car driver will be more likely to be 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families, friends and employees, what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be ready to bring your chiming money or the relatives that they go through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported in 2015 100 hate, according to the latest numbers from the Hassverbreach report of the FBI, which entered the state in terms of the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The itineration is also a reply to a new Missouri Law which would be difficult, a company due to residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) were issued for Texas and Arizona, after the States accused of immigration authorities to arrested people because of immigration laws, which will contribute to the ACLU for further renting profiled.</seg>
<seg id="66">Itineraries will be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in the last time, advocacy groups should be used in response to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weideception is elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">Fishbacher Weidezvn project is a successful project and will continue in next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliament's CDU Parliament and Kordula Kovac have a picture in front of the place.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Lawyer of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fishbacher CDU city network met with the Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann repaired insights into its operation, in which he accommodates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest cultivates, 40 milk kisses and also many young animals and are accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest Milk" is responsible for him the alternative-marketable way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holidays comes exclusively for regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he also is BLHV-Chairman of Fishbach, he called the Weideception project as "elementar". "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't be able to steal steal surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area concern for a lot of work, many mute with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and the topography with the topography.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elterial operation and managed to use this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he is no bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the local community has recognized the meaning of the turnkey projects and is glad about the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">With costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hope that the collection can still be sent out for a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure which we have, are the people who work in agriculture and are thought out as they bring their farm," entered the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers stand for the promotion often in the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The refurbishment area is about 40 hectares, which will not be enforated until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of €71 million, half of the leader was funded by the village of Fishbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers stayed 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac betonte: "you do not make a good job, without farmers and country.</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood: "the best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Regional Assembly line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg is allowing the state support of turntables.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the proposition of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">A precondition is the presence of one of the LPR identified by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the resulting surface is not bad-persectable (hangers over 35 percent) and must be threatened by redemption.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fishbacher Weighlaunch project 2018 now the application of eight participants with 24 plots which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The refurbishment area equal to 35 hectares, the low cost of low cost amounts to more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now, the White House of Trump carries out the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to start when they start the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate that as any other - so the carefully organized crash of Saddam Hussein's place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the trump regime, knew certainly what he did, when he had an symbolic axe in a heated strife with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals for the drastic restriction of legations with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller was not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A hordes of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators have had to have suffered him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he touched their meaning, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American liberty, which lighteth the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to that it was added later, was not part of the original Liberty Statue. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is sachable right, but as he formulated it, does not really see history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only one, in which one state will not only spend any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "your trouble, your poor, your poor, are free to breathe to breathe out of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elding waste" was better to see to our screens. "</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not involved in literary criticism - he made clearly that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural emigration: it is indeed a conflict by the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who looked for themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew quite well that they had full-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republics, by combining them in an unused classic image representation of the female crank of liberty.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in its poem the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself gives herself a very different names: mother of exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the podiment with the picture is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus has changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes of the buyer for the Comet of Trump, argumented 2010 that the Statue of Liberty reports that the American flame burned in the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes off.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the liberty of the liberty of the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite a question of the statue of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Indeed, the great horantasieous fact of Lazarus was it to see them how they had seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travel on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense, the world from the perspective of people to see the refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome you must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that's not the perspective, you know the Miller and Trump ever.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred, who is the only source of power, is lit.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black loaves Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when two shallots were among the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Field director of the United Kingdom's Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-piece Scottish Kontingent will be a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athlete was selected for London in 2017 on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland is something special" and the Athletics of the United Kingdom to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we are trying to understand it, and we will continue until we'll need to figure," Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I say people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has done something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has done something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type of street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athlete, medals-warned, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m Route, while Eilidh Doyle was elected to the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her capital address was incredibly, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were pottish or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and true feeling, the Eilidh all of course, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-silver medal winner, which is due to compete at its fifth World Championships at 400 m Hurdles, says that it is "incredibly" is that 16 Schotten in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">The highest total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which was in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distances of Muir leads on this way and placed two european records in the past year and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Schotte designed to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle recalls their first World Championships, when the only other Schotte in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ruling capital says that it is enormous proud of "on the fact that many of their landfancy are not only for the team, but also in some cases, also with medals and the final.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the most important part of the team has been elected in that it was elected by the other members of the team, so that it was anyway a great honour to know that my team mate is voted for me, and have chosen me something very special for me," added it.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes get off on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is talking to my speech as a capital?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it was good.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and take advantage of that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and to compete and it is simply as a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocks from critics on Facebook: do not accuse to a public office if you do not use the provisions of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it took not long until the newspapers declined him because of the foreign policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shot at the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not tell his critic for silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">In 1783 Washington said, "The Redepressing can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led as sheep as the sheep."</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who need to work out more than Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted your opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union pleaded not guilty to the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Staff of the governor left the suit as a frivol, and the online comment was full of a reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it's important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, who is amazing popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two thrust approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">HOGAN is not a reacute heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict disposition of principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary agent to connect with his voters and play his haarless head to chemotherapy on its side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the block of persons that come to the side of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially, and of employees who are paid by public tax-dollar - unnecessary and finally endangered.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans Spcherin Amelia Chasse on the actions of the governor and argumented that the blockage of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's easy to use the image of TROLLING or donations or hash-filled people to use the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post said with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no condensation.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told, that their comments is respectful, and not profaned.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed on Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hassessed, but she asked to hate hatred.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented, that I was disappointed, that there was no reaction to hate hatching and other current news," she wrote in the comments "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I guess these idea also not when a number of people on the same subject position, then they will be used by some more than a so-called collective use, and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the staff of the Governors as "concentrated spam attack," would probably call us "Füre"</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cutting a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It's much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect newspapers with critical conductivity and demonstration, or demonstrators and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly what's just happens.</seg>
<seg id="192">HOGAN is not the first public officials that criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is denied by Twitter users that blocked by his Twitter feeds.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County dismissed the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, as they knew a voters of their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers were promising in 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterers replied on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had an anonymous configure.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Belisarius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers, the Washington's decisions made.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions that gained its position on the contract of Amity, commerce and shipping with great Britain criticized the office, according to the historic documents that were collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put it to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of freedom, differences and discourses are part of our nation's foundation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And the true command means that we accept.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club</seg>

<seg id="1166">Over the cost, the Swiss wanted to do no information.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Brancheninsider estimate the order volume in accordance with "Nordwestschweiz" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more importantly, the advertising effect is a prestigious order for a Schoggimanufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">As many candidates there is on the new announcement, the Swiss will not be betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But in question they are only Swiss manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper article, chocolat Frey wants to make a renewal of contract about the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate was not accessible to a statement.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "COMRADE Detective" into the Nic</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is nostalgic because of the glorbit days of the characters from the 80-year-old Grunge era (as the predenker David Wain and Michael Showage the Sketch-Comedy "The State" for the MTV act), and for itself - that is, for 2001, before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefacts, it is equally a parody and a salary of our Facebook able era.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But it feels like Franchise, when it was running time.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly good, not just because of his absurd humor (it contained a original history for a promising tin, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By playing on the core of the Gags - actors medium age to play for children who are grown to grow, they still made the option to win the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later", with his adults who play now adults is less emotionally distressed and his parody goes more after the foundry films of the 90-er years as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that the cradle"). "</seg>
<seg id="1190">At a point, a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovable Coop (Mr. Showage), now Romanautor, has never forget Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his young people still lost.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is still another weit-malignant plot, in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showage), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good old impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exchange rates of the best part of Franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It makes very much fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd to see the Matt Dillons Underlippenbart of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now felt like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">There are the moments of madness, which this Franchise could happen like a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I will show as his logical conclusions: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".</seg>
<seg id="1198">"COMRADE Detective" at Amazon, reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: at the rebelting of the Cold War of "The Navy," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even at "GLOW" with his East-towards-West Ringcombat-Ikonography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka paffed comedy with Rhys Thomas as a director who gives a harpent TV series with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, Atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main purpose - an hard fleet Gregor and an ideal Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt set in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than a idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some beautiful Gags to see the police (the police forcing the time to watch chess in television as Americans do perhaps with football do).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous spokesperson - including Jenny Slate, Nick offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a wonderful game 'find voice out'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "COMRADE Detective" is committed so much for the truthfulness of a doubt propaganda drama - a murderer that carries a react mask is enough - that it is often playing as a single game.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six episodes about six episodes, the comedy is gone, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"COMRADE Detective" that was redigged on a smaller length, could reprove his Agitprop-Satire, because Gregory and Iosef always managed to visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two dicken's men, who allow one bunch of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The Embassy for the imaginates communist audience is that the Western culture can do all for a vage.</seg>

<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker in a passion for real estate, collapsed in 2014 from a big home in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne had not packed her bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I love me in love and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a shaded layout - you had to go into the bedroom to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Joanne Stauraum and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, great windows, plenty of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my request, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, they assigned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home, not just a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was on to create a mezzanine, in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to remember creative to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is rather complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the premises so that they were overstacked, without that we had to go back to us.</seg>

<seg id="1337">The use of spans plays a role in the design of theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow him longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, it feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units can offer space for all stocks and glasses of Joanne.</seg>

<seg id="1344">"a bit soap art went in," explains the fan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important so that it is very easy when you move the door to the door."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to CLEVEREN utilisation of space and storage space, Joanne had an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you'll sell the base area - or as your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In a rudimentary form, a real estate agency will perform in real estate business and perform a calculation based on the floor size. "</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they made it to use the base area to enlarge and at the same time high-quality materials that create space to its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and they are therefore help to create a emotional engagement in a home" says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into the electric sockets in walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat is characterized by a good design and increased square meterates from a little standard in something very astonished.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff is planning to transfer the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and are failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to prevent the information flow on president trump - including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House on his first working day, he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he repaired the sound of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that we should make information about him - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would make better decisions when he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waist diagnosis makes sense, but others have attempts to monitor trump by taking their media monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television goes back - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Candidate Trump was dismissed due to an unfair report, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of digits who were to convince him," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February to POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key, trumps Twitter habits under control, according to six former election campaign officers, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steadily praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter has ever been "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaworms thing that we don't know what we don't know that Trumps Tweet did not contain any additives without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably learn something about the Tweets that has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff made it a number of times, troubles from him was rewarded with him, then their efforts were rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevent trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a willow house which reprove itself from convene parties, always attempting to present their own agenda, possibly prove their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - based on this history - reported about the prediction of adviser to introduce the president of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump civil servants say that Trump can react as a volcano in negative press lines, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he could easily find out what these originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly what happened at the end of February, when somebody sent a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson who accused the deputy chief commander in Katie Walsh, "the source behind him of Lecks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banned from Twitter, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he was sold in the past, or did it down in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher have added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebke and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tries to manage a system to manage the paper to manage the paper."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did the folded?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later, to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective Manager as Priebke, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors are still influence on the influence.</seg>

<seg id="1482">The newspaper cuttled the step as a sign that Mueller is widened shape and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcasting station CNN reported that it was already first inviting the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between Trumps and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret service accuse the Kremml since then, targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also recorded more and more trumps private and business environment among the magnifying glass.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator trump personally moved into the centre, and the inventor submission, whether the president of the affair may be disabled.</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">In how far the climate change has played a role in the collapse of the ice skill, it is unclear after research information.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, it has been a series of unusual collars by iron pipes in the region, the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, that can be summed up with the warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colt was so far a part of Larsen-C-Schelcelebrating.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Pain floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelcelebrating s located south of South America almost at the head of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfeises was the balance of juniquets and abomiting some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete scarf will be broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It would be so that the Larsen-C-Schelcelebrating show in danger, because the front edge had never moved so far as far as.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate under voltage and can be broken down, in case of a key collection.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelcelebrating and Eisberg raises the sea level, since they swim on the water, and ice as much water, as it seems after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the torrent is that the glacier directly overcomes into the sea, and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could increase the sea level, but only in the low dimension, the British research project writes in the observation of the Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelcelebrating s of AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the Antarctica has celebrated the fourth largest in Antarctica.</seg>

<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural view and no direct connection to climate change, the iron sign is now on a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"that is the most far retreat since the beginning of the records," confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists be controversial if the Larsen-C-Schelcelebrating will again grow and possibly complimes, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers have not fall on climate change, even though this researchers have not fall into climate change, so many shining of the Antarctic peninsula are destroyed in the past decade.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long Ziranates of Antarctic extends the direction of South America.</seg>

<seg id="1715">Kimmich passed away after a few crackers in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>

<seg id="1817">There are no homepoch of violence, and throughout the country the bodies are more often: at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto opened its position in December 2012. 589, after attacks and threats under German laws and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The latter is the editor and its inspirator by Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its lack is defied, although its presence is present everywhere. two reporter in the three years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-Shirts, showing his smile of the face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, trauma, its nightmares, sleep, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010, a special procedure was erected in order to process the cases of journalists, these according to the Committee of journalists detained only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders who are associated with drug trade and organized crimes, the murderers of journalists will only rarely be judged by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still exist to treat the force of Sinaloa, although they are intrapped and even though the terrain is now available.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without righteousness, the meeting to discussion of security little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to turn my time in this workshop," says he.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the Why do we know."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce, in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">It only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla from two men. he was shot down from his car and 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated to "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The contactors passed away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors inclined to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing more silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans has been arrested for arrest in the last year and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloody battlefields of the country since rivalisizing fractions are fighting here to fill up the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It is nothing of that in Sinaloa each day someone or more people on the road, or that the graveyard is full of distressed, two-storey mausoleen for drones, the larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel takes control over the coastal area with its valuable harbours and drugs routing in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was consciously aware of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, one of them that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two abnormalities have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the release of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of a rivalance cartons in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may be offended with the sons, thought Gangmembers bought every copy of the edition as soon as she was delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was in it, Valdez don't go to zwingen, after the complying of another newspaper that had the same story, the country had to leave its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his potence is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived, that his friends and colleagues were anname that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was employed as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he completed five colleagues to the establishment of Riodoce, and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism, without the noise dote problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper served a reputation for the encourage and honest report, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it, hard treating investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read more otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez win the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage at the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where it was always guided.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to live," he said to the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug store in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"it must take you to take you as a journalist - either that or you play the Dummen.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done so many dead... why did you not say what went off?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team measures Valdez, the fun bird that could fluke like a harbour labourers, the friend, the generous with floods and rating, a teacher, knew how to survived.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted to his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there are always sitting at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced to ask her own advances in question, how they can stay their work at the best, and stay in life on the life.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like to move with their wives, their children, their cleanse shops, their home starting and ways of ways to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-zenship and self-locking.</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instinct trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it werwrong, lead them away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "Smell can be a sense that happens... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say in Sinaloa no more - same as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mixture of lucrative lubrication, weak institutions and corrupted government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room which we met the staff of Riodoce for security training, suddenly there were no phones allowed. days previously, Spyware that is sold exclusively to governments, used to monitor journalist and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside policemen protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were instructed by the country's government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a mid-class-quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, surveyed some of the reporter whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the policemen who described themselves as a trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months now, since the reporter went to the mountain scenery, where the drug associated de facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has moved on three main layers.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to citizens, concentrated on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Office of the Office.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was kidnapped, or as it happened, so was careful when it was time to write, what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite place of threats and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a political kers, who ruled the reigning institutional revolution Party (PRI), which controlled all political levels in the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal bat the reporter of writing about previous incidents in this Lokal, among them one who went into a son of "El Chapo" Guzman.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez have been regarded as the best known source on the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in early we would have recovered what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office has been dedicated to a storage space for characters and sticker, dedicated to the Morde of journalists, because the staff had become something, what they never had expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapte a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalists to the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame vanished three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and civil servants, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists had been stronger than the whole country by giving the protests "SOS Press" in organized protests and construction in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="1891">At that day, Director Bojorquez is gone into Washington and tries to collect international support for the Justice in the Fall of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuse the authorities, journalists will displaying and bring them to the truth, because they have told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that it is impacted by the government, because it is impacted that her rage is injured their objective.</seg>
<seg id="1894">In Valdez, Valdez had said that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes, involved government officials and an equal society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that Reporter are not only killed by drug trap, but also on the command of politicians and security forces that led with the organized crimes under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media art group "Articulo 19" has accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you live because they want to hold the mouth," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the Morde have a abhorrious effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one proves the death of the blogin Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas samell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphone plates next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Other do further, as El Manana was done by Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their direct investment in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed to the drug card on the title page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are fled from their home country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile, and observe the streets and seek after danger.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they become chased, as it manifested to the photographer Ruben Espinosa who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue back and continue working, it is a daily dance with risk-rich decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra who once wanted to be a poet that the drug store him troubled him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to Hell, and therefore I was Reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Around midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already completed, the editors of Riodoce was on the office and trans beer, than once all their phones began to Summen.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting with band rivales and security forces near the seaside Mazatlan had 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued, as it was promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the stoneware, they have released the news on the website of Riodoce about mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heulted near - a further shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez casting a look at the policemen who held the guard to see if they were in standby.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid of all, they did not show them.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the enormous portrait of the found founder of the newspaper, whose mid-finger was visible for sinkaloa, followed by Riodoce.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only remember it," Bojorquez, "when on the same day, on the same day, the internship was murdered, she asked me to send it on the road to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to soak his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At the first glance, it looks like a statue, even though a scent.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now, researchers found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhinocacy of a Canadian miners so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa der Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even determine that his shripped skin of reddish-brown was - and they said, they would have had something from a "unquiet past".</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the magazine "Current Biology" called him as "the bestering armoured dinosaurs who ever been found, and one of the best Dinosaurs specimens of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered kind of Nodosaurs who lived in the middle of the chalkage between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievably good condition has researchers that really worth it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armoured plant makes the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on March 21, 2011 in Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was missing from the surrounding rock on the Platze, and decided to look more.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all of these hard work, the ready result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you come only a little with eyes blind, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is shown.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is one of the most beautiful and best preserved Dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa der Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant fresser, although it is covered with a armor, probably from flesh, probably refresher Dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily stocked Dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves, and used a screeningsystem that is known as a counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and his enemies, experts, what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature dating from the Nodosaurs family made for the first time frame and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studies the wild animal studies and there are Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum technicians Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of sheds and armaments on his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">It covered the shady shady, a common Defense Method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature darker was as their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the actual shady is usual, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta as far as far as the living animals survives today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure caused by flesh to refresher Dinosaurs that evolution of the confrontation of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals allowed to use the shady pshady or belt animals - are much smaller and injured as a prey, what signalized that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real battle.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong prebtier behavior on a massive, strong armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs-smoking animals have to have been" said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the Dinosaurs was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on critics over his life, including his conservative loans to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that Dinosaurs died when he died, into a river, and beaten up into the sea, where he sank on the front of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was so warm like South florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more landward than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because he is fully covered with preservative skin, but also in three dimensions stays and the original form of the animal has retains," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal is almost as well as in the early delivery time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">They don't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you're just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is on sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was time, as huge thermal des, carnize Dinosaurs, which stood on two legs on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta lived, the armoured dinosaurs of some of his frowterrestrial ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, which appear to appear in current biology, believe that Borealopelta was removed after the death in the sea and in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on March 21, 2011 in Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the foretained armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armament, and is completely from the snout to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips made by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant was flowed by the Western Canada by the West Canada, until a flooded river was flowed into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the Dinosaurs preserved its armament in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The stoneous overthrow of this special copies are so well preserved that the skin is still unchallenged tank plates along the Dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko for National Geographic, it is such a level of preserves such as a profit in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more render it will.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified residual of the skin still cover the holpricing tank plates that bear the skull of animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot is situated on his side, his five fingers are stored on the top.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole sole '.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: Massenkarambolage to A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 cars are wounded within a mass-aircraft artwork.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous injuries, kilometre long stressed - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) in the late morning of Thursday, about 20 people were injured.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Following the first data of the police against 17.00, the police were between the junction Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a gewitters almost 30 cars, among them also lorries, inspirited.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Over the exact number of injuries initially no information before.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It involve easy to moderate injuries, a polishing precher said.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large imprint on lifejacket was at the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was closed in Munich direction Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In Fahrenheit Munich, a total of around ten kilometres long returned.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As a AZ-reporter, it also reported on the way to massive disabilities - by numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the license number of vehicle flection, which now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 hrs. then a second accident at the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">It was a collision between an Autotranger and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A cue helicopter was on the road to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">German railways: group testet "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that has experienced almost once again: nothing is sitting at the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or man is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: pufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">In the heart of the workflow, the rheinfalls comes from the workflow in the midst of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Postcard control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruption are coming soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The German railways currently testify the renderless driver control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You can simply be confirmed by phone that you have taken his place and evaluated the ticket card.</seg>
<seg id="1995">At present, a test mode runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"we offer the offer, we have made it out.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It is expected to be available in early next year to many other remote control routes in Germany, "said a railway speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"Comfort Check-in" is called the way to get the card validation without the rheinfalls.</seg>
<seg id="1999">To use the requirements, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to booked an online ticket - what you need to do most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You have to bought it about the app the DB Navigator, which is a comfortable type of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last you need a seat placement.</seg>
<seg id="2003">For the "Comfort Check-in": you will rise up in the train, calling his ticket under "My tickets" on.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Then a button for electronic devaluation then appears with the test results.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The addition to their mobile devices have a message that Fahrgast X is in the train and has taken the booked seating for Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Arrives to the driver control at # Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already valuable online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to continue, continue to keep further silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers that should take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"he who want to travel without a ticket control by our train travels, check out in the DB navigator itself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables passengers to design their journey time in the train "train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Management Board by DB correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those often does train ride, know that next to delays and passionist trains will belong to the largest doctors.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one has enough, in any case, one of the competence not all documents, you need to use online tickets for the evaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either is missing the credit card or personal credit card or one document that you must have.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The consequence are endless discussions between train conductor and driving gast, which leads to bad mood in part or large space and delays during the control of your own tickets, and will take care of the career at the end of the time to take care of others.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Other train numbers on the same route are not registered.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken until her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after it arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of a Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone.</seg>

<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police and people, the crying, and of a man who claimed to be a shield with the inscription: "Fergusons Police has killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live Feed, with a group of demonstrators in front of a group of demonstrators with a belline dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said that another policeman is his rifle and cried, "I will kill you..." Animals all kill you. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2035">"that's not the kind of murder, which we have spoiled to us, and which we can rely."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment, I felt dry frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She buck a return trip, and went home to the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she won their 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning were to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of surviving and protest, the strength and the loss of power, the strength and the resistance, which consists of the point of people living in the community and the streets are filled to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell carried out with her daughter, a flower dress and a matching crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation which she had countless times before this morning, "over the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight against what they believe?" she reminded that what she said. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and did not work correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take her, "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened to today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">They must know and see it and on it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to be free to free for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I do good luck, you have experienced an experience, when they have experienced no eklatant reinforism, it is not different than the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would give you a bad service to keep them away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station in Ferguson arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a village opposite the police authority, which was waiting for the possible non-indictment by officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There were Ferrell and her daughter with a local business-company, lunch made.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halted them to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly I started to take a new kind of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August, and said," she said, "she said that she was a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis President of the University of Missouri St. Louis's president and health inequalities in black municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organization.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met at the Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to be documented "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came in the sense: "you want to find it or try to find a story that you can utilize her?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepsis was nourished by countless cases of people, often from the White - in a community who benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan has recently explained in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices shall not be centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is for his activism rum of death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer, together with six other inscribed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the major thing for me, as these people are depicted, because I will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrel's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but for a community that comes together, "said Folayan - they proved itself as the manifest participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Consequently, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrel lives, like she loves and married her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Far, and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that in this work, and the human being of the black people have to give a certain hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrel's story repeated the role of black sways women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement that have changed the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012, identify the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the motion," said Frell, "and therefore we are fighting at various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women need to bear the main load of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan voted to note that "the movement really kept the movement of black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it is that "this is not an affirative type of action," when the fermentation was chosen as heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who fears this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although she was in front of the front, because at a life in these cruises than a black, sweat woman so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson has long gone, but the racial connections between the congregation and the police are still living.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell's deadline for 2 ½ years due to block the block at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she was oblicked at a song and she felt this memorial, since they left three years ago in Ferguson on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our obligation to fight our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our obligation to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love one another and support.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" up "size" "" "" "" TV-Reader discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery move the people, although they are not built for long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the Southern of the pedestrian zone has been obsolete since the first presentation in 2009, the population in Beacon and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic is hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" on our Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one-bit gallery say, "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "needs no man" (Siggi. "" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the feared thereon, there is a gallery more customers into the city, including the remaining shops, fear the opponents that the pedestrian zone is hips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added to the gallery: the gallery is planned on the grounds of the market, in which 13 direct markers will offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-Macher want to integrate a market in the new building - and to the Beda square with possibility to sit without sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone guest rooms: "we have been offering almost weekly in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country can always be glad.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We discovered the butchers we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish us that during and above all after construction of the gallery there is a chance to get rid of this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also that.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small markthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether for direct marketed in the gallery of the gallery, we arrive at the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The new project is probably just too low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why buy shopping at Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, dropping or supermarkets: I find it liquid.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Of which there are enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many charges are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But there's not even a regular weekly market, it is so important that at least the Markthalle remains at least once again.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the service offered goods are fresh, is mainly offered directly from the product and is available in inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, the shop will be rented in a shopping centre only of larger firms, because the dorms are often not affordable for one retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Shame, special business there is almost no more and that, which is still left, then will probably vanish. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a markthalle suitable for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially where is the peasant market during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even on duration if the bit gallery is actually actually come.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it know the full bit gallery before, to distribute all the shops in Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center, which is empty, does not need to use.</seg>
<seg id="2121">I would have been better to promote my view to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market, it is definitely a lot more - how I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no space more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">If the peasant market is capitated, a piece of culture is vanish. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible the same - which are attached to cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarmann created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyzer was a 35-year prison sentence when she was publicly tradited to the "WikiLeak's website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has been united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwife and discarded dissidy, whose conviction was converted to Barack Obama, when he was only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of DNA which could be extracted with these genomatic data, such as someone with these genetic data could not only be interpreted to the formability of DNA data - the many ways can be interpreted and the hardening detection of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born when Bradley Edward was born, but since its puberty open on the identification of a woman, was convicted for 20 charges, including six mutations against the Spionagegesetz, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that it was only one single photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning sits unlikely on a driver's seat and a platinum blonde performs - which was associated with them.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist portraits of strangers such as cigstummel and chewing gum, extracted the DNA from the waste, to produce a picture of them how it might look like this people.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time that she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she was not able to visit this time and could not be photographed, therefore they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their inhafre Muse were interacted to our letters that interchangeable several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">She even asked one of the Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic "Suppressed images" which would be a future predicting to see the President Chelseas judgement and she would like to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happier meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, because Donald Trump led a war against informant from the government camps and against transying troops to find new, tweetable ways to cover the rigid spur which he should actually be able to flaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she told that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one of the wall of the gallery of the gallery, Manning resulted in their oversized signature (the "i" in her family name) is an end of the "automatic fragment, whose foundation is sex, breed, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandths of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) as an astonishing, at least in biological execution, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take care, that our genome is not concerned, who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, too.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a own room, is one page from the above mentioned comic novels.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as it comes with a Freisprechtelefon in the hand out of the disciplinary of the United States as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they chill your speech, then they won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so will never see the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came from a letter that she has written to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I am still visible even if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen himself - as it was presently seen in the comic book - but if they should do it in the middle of the room of the masks, it will be greeted by their own genomic simulations that were summarched as hordes of Protestants.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This also was targeted, as all in the exhibition, until the size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), which have been written with pencil, with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel as a human quantity," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, as the movement that wanders even behind their liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and a employee of the University of Oxford for potence</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human-hunt is in the Gange for a professor at Northwestern University and a employee of the University of Oxford, having been searching for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants for murder of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, after several engravings died.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A parent warning system by Chicago, published in Chicago, was discovered that the corche was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several injuries in his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared on the place of the sieve for dead, and Detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police are actively seeking to the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem now has been excluded, and was excluded from the campus of the Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University encoded with this investigation," said Cubbage.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman of the university and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are ready to contact with the police in contact and ready to help the U.S. Investigator authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens colleagues shocked and want that he exhibited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he needed to establish the suspects on the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have a vision of their stay, and our efforts to locate them," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call of the building of the Grand-Plaza-building that had just received a dizzy tip that had just happened in the apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said that it was unclear if the incident was taken at the 27th of July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victims had a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "the police is currently working at the time axis and the background of the victims, including a variety of motives, including one possible formation."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will close the WADA driver in the near future" - the Russian vice remier Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">The Russian vice-mier Vitaly Mutko said, it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti-Doping agency (WADA) will be converted to the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of fulfillment of the roadmap RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">The WADA driver was updated in this respect, "explained Mutko on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented the second part of the WADA to comply with the code that describes criteria for reintegration of RUSADA and recently published on the website of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA during the near future. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of those in the list mentioned criteria, however, states that the Russian Anti-Doping authorities demonstrates the reported outcome of the investigation conducted by the WADA by the Canadian attorney with the Canadian Attorney by Richard McLaren.</seg>
<seg id="2189">In terms of the matter, Mutko said: "we conduct the examinations because our anti-Doping system has had an error.</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">But there was no state programs, and we will not do something that does not exist. "</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos words voted by Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales department Rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov problems of the past in Russian Anti-Doping organizations, then added: "we have repeated that the report about the controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">No one has added any report to accept this report, "Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was dismissed in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandals from the WADA by doping control in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Charrett wanted to monitor the happiness at your e-commerce start-up but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Responses were often vage, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>

<seg id="2207">"there were simply never consistency and Objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>

<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that allow the specific purpose of the employee engagement, allowing it to provide enterprises, Specials and demographic groups, employees anonymity and demographic groups that allow C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you have now tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" he said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics of companies is used to measure staff's commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">It said that she has a better view into what your employee think, and feel it in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company which shows the majority of most complaints and which guide to have low evaluation results - so that you can get drilled, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture, so that it has not been the next Uber, which has been published in scandals in which, since then a former employee has been published, which has been spoken by the ones who have spoken in the ones who have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For Start-Ups, such as Glint is this desire for an overview a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118,7 billion, according to the financial technical website Let Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, startup converting Convercent, the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Falles in Misscredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently filed as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, converting Convercent Companies custom "powder" Use, confidential answers in real time, collect the warmth maps of your problem.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS-Hotline that can subscribe to the staff of bad behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the principal leaders is covered, complaints to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of the public opinion has been recorded," Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or unethically, it can be costly consequences by consumers-boycott, worker fluctuation and complaints, said Jeslan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant-chain with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convercent has been used for more than a year to ensure that people are aware of politics and procedures, and have an easy way to reach their operational headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if a employee of a problem was to sign or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail to the corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was serious.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a notorious and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tues General Counsel, who said, there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company converting Convercent, problems, which were previously identified by executives, which were hidden in offices in cities or States, have been identified as discrimination, harassment or unmistakes trainees.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can closer to this holistic, 360-degree view to experience with employment," said Vitrano, who lead the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders in Employment Law."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Company started, ethics, values and employees of commitment to 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen has collapsed due to ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said Jeslan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "Social Media came to their right," that companies knew that you could not prevent her dirty guard online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before the use of technology to monitoring the ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint as well as Convercent provide your software as service, and load the company with recurring charges for use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to support the approval of Venture Capital Investors, which both Start-ups have supported.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, leading to the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering Glassed a $10 million in November of Better Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising, in view of the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex in research that shows that today's staff are expected more than to date.</seg>
<seg id="2240">Highly competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high content and interesting projects only inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The staff want to feel that you are accepted and be estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are glad in a company, feel that their vote is worth being worth it, then they feel better to make this company succeed," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent as well as Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Attained earnings if its portfolio businesses well run. companies run good if staff are dedicated and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics Tools will promise third, commitment and use of employees, it's no wonder that you can find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Data about the employee's commitment after the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the treatment of a company does not take action.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-he years a Schlupfhole.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years turbulent history of his cozy headquarters in Kent and is now looking for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years," says he weep. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England is the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist, Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on a archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's TEETH and Other Stories', a collection which inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that it was unexpected emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I just reacted on the thumb pressure on the side of a letter which was written by a double agave in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins." he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"that is his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters smell out after smoke, because he was a fire because of light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For anyone who lives 300 years later, the smell has a effect, as it would be even though.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I Love Archive! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who supported so with old papal that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England, and almost four months lived in a castle ("in order to be a little overrated") it seems to be nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to study the viktorian "new" castle to study the archives and many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like that the monortees were spent on walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the terrain and ruins of the ancient castle, and spoke with Landscapes, gardeners, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, nachts drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received the full access in 2006, when the last diam, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">As rRhodes a decade later, the staff started to take care of the archive, which he said as "hundreds of years, in which Aristodies said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, maps, who think what possessed: "it could be boring that land conflicts could be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go through his gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories will use the castle as a starting point to spread on a wider basis in the English history, including 'The Labourer', who left the newly built castle, who left the newly built castle of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a tumult which appeared in 1380 in the castle with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant arose in this area and I thought, a bellion is a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are linked together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are fixed in the history of the castle - as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron that the family of Darrell seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smugglers', shown in the 18th century, who filled his own burial, having filled a sarg with stones (a discovery that was made until his Sarg was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the men's rails is to be right to be debts and money for things that they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men deletes their training crises by using rich women and married - I place them as a bunch well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise Erbinnen. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his application in the castle is Rhodes on the search for other unique write-experience</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elashamed monks behind it, the site of a sanatorium dating back to the early 20th century, which has been returned from nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go again," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2349">Against 486 people, which had been involved in the coup attempt to be involved in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup had called Erdogan attempt to move the "religious gift," because he would give him the opportunity to clean the Armed Forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But is Erdogan the army really in handle?</seg>

<seg id="2353">In the general Staff of the army for an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which are manifested in the uplift of the headchancots for solo. he wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the big cleaning of the army and security forces goes further.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July the Erdogan sent another 7395 citizen, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed to the military to the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times poured them under appeal to her role as a guard of the world of world.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan entered the power of the military's power for step, not at appeal to the Reformations of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers, Erdogan, aims for an Islamization of the Armed Forces.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The Ascent of Sex-Robots is real, and we should make worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can't be crazy about 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report about the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its form of breast cancer and type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people make it funny, but the company provide every quantity of it, and we will get much more common to see," said Mr Sharkey about the publication of its new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex buffs are developed from their inflating partners to robots with a silicone skin which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved through the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt its robots to its convincing, "and they are all select, from the eye colour of the robot via the form of breast cancer to the type or color of his fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will still be troubled when many robots are "personalities" who would make a Stepford-wife progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex buffs are developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotanix robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics that they find appealing as the sober.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," giving the impression of notoriental and "Wild Wendy" with a "discourage" personality. "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality to help your personality as good as possible," swim the site of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So do you like what you like, and they don't like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, they even has her voice - quite as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, fixed on conversational or her can be "in moods"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many troubled aspects in this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replacing real human relationships, but the unscreations of rape, when you get a step on Frigid (meaning here: contrasting) Farrah, beunquiet a most of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a VIBRATOR, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a VIBRATOR, why can men have no Roxxxy?" it is on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, this sex-robots are not only a fetish, or just a different sex game.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing oil refines on a little dark and lowering of our culture, to a withdrawal of ideal of equality of the sexes, after sex with submission as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, have no sex robots, and while the FRR is increasing its increasing popularity, they remain on the edge of the consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is gone out of the Randzons, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or strangled, until they are subject to the free market for this permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is yet a certain overthrow that this highly developed sex robots in a period, in which the rights of women are threatened, in which there are a presidents who has become princt, women with sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The awful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid 's Tale' ('The report of the handmaid') are not the graphical images that affects the swimmed body, but as realistic these vision.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it feels like a great jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind this sex robot is that there is a physical similarity to actual women so realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Her bowyers want to feel the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But it was brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robot will not constitute a real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't separate from their companions or simply away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no confusion or background, nothing, what happens to independence or anything, what the imagination must interrupt the imagination.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Differently, you are pleasing slaves.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to hold the healthy human rights</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binary era of trump era that the political struggles which have to have the US voters, which have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedonian was there in the USA newspapers, with advice about it, how to go with the horror of trump of trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We strict all supposedly to put our filter blow.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notices have been power trumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have chosen this because my cousin, a left-related poet, who lives in Chicago, and has visited this week in New York that week.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity can have a mighty effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White house, everyone who knows them, including the Republican transformation, with which they fought against the decade due to politics, suddenly and very strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls in another context that this is also considerable risk with itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The Left was strengthened by trump, but the effect of his presidency, the power to shoot us all after the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the cruel possibility that his lebs can't be cast out of one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a long-time long-time scenario, in the trump Republicans of the right wing "normalised" which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards, suddenly appealing to his standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find me today with a active pimneys for Mitt Romneys (but at least, at least, as at least, we had seen how his tax declaration saw) - which both occur in comparison to Trump in fact, in fact, as a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When trump passes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy, to qualify for itself as an unknown improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought to our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the Karusehold's New York Business Division, and the best three dollars that can be found in the city, if you need no caffeine needed.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous large, the fiberglass designs at the central cylinder - all Clowns are knurred and the animals are turning to look full of their own shoulders - extremely finster and the klimpering music, to perceive this in notable manner.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many small clichés of a city disappointed: the views of high buildings become old, the Skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five-five years later, and I'm still not yet over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not one of the Swiss Cottage - the subjects-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Karussell is still a strange experience, since here two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old you can walk and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have written the carousel, I would have given him a full score, but fortunately no one has asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before being able to pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the cargo.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This is not just a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also involve pressure on the server, to do personality into a situation in which no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman at the department store was terrific, while I tired the experience to submit my credit card using five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he had his girlfriend for a nightly cheer who was hidden in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal against the six year sentence of Pistorius Appell, from which they say to cautiously.</seg>

<seg id="2539">He reported varied, but challenging tasks that wait for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, wonder don't bid to fill the required profile profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city looks for the next time of a architects or building engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So, - under review of regular cancellation periods - still enough time for a development.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach was appointed for the administration of administration as a sube Building authority, the application must be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city on every case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If you cannot fill this no longer, the citizens would have to drive out until Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But civil war is the city and himself also important, says Wacker that tells of a good operating lima as well as good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years, some important projects have accumulated, based on the tacker with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city of life," he is about the building of building and his staff safe.</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, varied projects on the agenda: remodelling of former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhockey parking space is approximately.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium is still subject.</seg>
<seg id="2551">With some 1.5 million euros, the latter is going to beech about 1.5 million euros, "if we make it right," it is rocket.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"everything in all wait great tasks on my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">The design is present to a town center of large playroom.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslachs, its own building yard and gardener could be quite flexibly reacted on many occasions.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," so wacker, and the design of the green plants will be often marked out of citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town is under memorial protection, it is important to have "an eye for this what is clean," if new superstructures will be approved, emphasized the destructor of the degradation.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Ohnehin carries the Stadtbaumeister high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is a building, "at the end it runs along my table here."</seg>
<seg id="2560">In support and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (High construction) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Gravbau) has been working for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also, that his successor is too long, Wacker: "we're looking for someone who really identified with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">For continuity is not only important for a good operating lima, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Those who want to know Roland Wacker, should be closed after information of the City Haslach, which can be noticeable as a diplomatic engineer or Bachelor in the fields of construction and construction conditions in the fields of construction and construction conditions.</seg>

<seg id="2574">The damage were fixed on Friday afternoon, the train traffic on the south track could be guided without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Nearly ten personalities were Friday morning, two of them looked at the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight wagons were not made, but they had delayed delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch had to exchanged some 200 meters of the upper section.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts have been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help, IBD (flammable intents) to liners</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can be used for your digestive system such as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed to the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms could handle patients with anti-inflammatory bowls.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The unhealed state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000, causing magic and bloodings, recurring or bloody breakdown, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the affected normally, meat and milk products to avoid their symptoms were found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found that the essential amino acid tryptophan has been developing the immune cells that promote an tolerant Darm.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that the immune cells in the Darm patrol, to ensure that harmful microben to hide themselves in the body, not in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are implantable, inflammations are disruptible by cells, and protect the tolerance and protect the body, without sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is inclined in the direction of inflammation, it may cause an anti-inflammatory surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments we found that a kind of tolerance conveying immunity in mice lead to conseated a particular bacterium in their initiatives.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that carry the tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had the immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory milieus if the same system is confused for people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan analysed a kind of immunoids such as they found out that a group of study powers such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was separated from that was not found.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They thought that the difference is to do with the intestinal microbible of the mice had the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms, which normally live in the stomach Darm Trains.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The Därme of the mice were found DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without they were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were mounted in an stering surrounding, so that they did not have an intestinal microbiom, and they were not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria sent to the immune system, the researchers used L. reuteri in a liquid, and carried out small quantities of liquid - without the bacterial cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed up to the tolerated cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid is cleaned, it proved to be a secondary product of tryptophan-metabolism that is known as an Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells were halved around 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people are the same tolerant promoting cells such as mice, and protect the most of us L. reuteri to our stomach traction.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-side-products from L. reuteri have found the cells in humans as well as mice, but defects in gends in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with anti-inflammatory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of this cells is probably something that we would like to promote these cells inflammation on the inner surface of the Darms.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially can result high tryptophan values in present from L. reuteri to a extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2622">New drills for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As though the wind revolves ever: when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader, Socialist and democratic Prime Ministers before the elections are always present with a certain concern after Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Only disorder from the parting centre, blower no counterwind from the covenant, so is the most important part of the voters.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz has led the party, it has changed considerably.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, staff members from Willy-Brandt-Haus with growing disposal in the SPD governed state capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">Since the beginning of the year, Schulz has been described there since the beginning of the year, with backwind cannot be described in the base.</seg>

<seg id="2631">"this is the basis of more: red-green, it can simply rely reliable," said CDU-Secretary Peter Tauber on the Editor network of Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising factional extraction of a Green MPs has shortened the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a severe crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the country's end, his red-green coalition lost their one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green Party Managing Director Michael Keller has been asked to release the Lower Saxony-member of Elke Tweels to return to their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to CDU means a clear verification of voters.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Twesten immediately returned her mandate, "said the Federal President and Election of the Green Editor of the Green editor Network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"this may not be true, if it is not true, the SPD voter turneth out that the new HithanksMessage reached the party centre in the Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD minister of Lower Saxony, stands for the takeover of the Green MPs Elke Tweet for CDU without own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional highlight of a whole range of large and small crises in the SPD regional associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what next comes.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Miscellaneous started with unexpectedly defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more not, soothing the comrade parent.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Everything will be different differently after landing elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia.</seg>
<seg id="2644">It was then - and indeed, everything was worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into taumburg, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smooth.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Effortable up the comrades in the weeks after that.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then when she had exhausted the new courage, the G-20 Summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him the next drills came.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD landscape shoreef lost his Nimbus because he sat in the Elbphilharmony while his city burned.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he had taken everything wrong in the crisis of Krisenkommunications, something that can be wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil now.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the supervisory board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been involved in the criticism of the criticism.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese Refragevalues were added.</seg>

<seg id="2656">The funeral of the former civil war of Hanover, his power in Berlin, remained not hid in the environment of Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They sent him to grant a stabilization of the party.</seg>

<seg id="2664">Ms. Twesten has not been elected for their person as a direct connection, but on the state of the Lower Saxony Parliament, the Lower Saxony Commons had been elected.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequences would be back to its mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, proclaim a "undemocratic maneuver."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the voters of four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil as a prime minister," says Oppermann, who led the Lower Saxony SPD as a presidency in the Bundestag.</seg>

<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been working in emplified sanitation regions.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the sanitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country was acquired two-third of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">At least 60 percent in the sanitation area II from 2005 to 2016, there was at least 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the present sanizations are a "successful project" - it is finally important to promote internal development, and not only new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, we received the information that there will be a renovation area in Karlsruhe.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount is 833 333 Euros, of which would come 500 000 euros from the country, the rest of the commune.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a renovation area now?</seg>
<seg id="2682">One will continue to examine Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it is also a role in the planned area at all interest, to sanieren.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In any case, the territory cannot move again.</seg>

<seg id="2690">The approval period for funding is scheduled for January 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September of this year, however, the inventory will only be carried out, as part of those who received questionnaire subjects a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, if possible, before the proposition of the proposition, this year can be started with the sanitation in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann declared that every commune commune the prepaid prey investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is to evaluate the urban characteristics and decide to decide when renovated and in which circumference.</seg>
<seg id="2695">It will also be registered for the respective property and entered a renovation work in the basic book.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come again after empties and make a picture of the location, she said.</seg>

<seg id="2910">For the one, many students raise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectants, who became a regular service when a domain rate had no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you have to report this report publishing date?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask, why the name is Georg Ratzinger at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages is dedicated, and it is significantly acquitted of every suspicion of the Mittens or mitigation against the awful cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence in front of the school was also outside of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can rethrow him, of which too late or were not serious enough to have taken enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The cathedral-atzengymnus, based on which he became real, was practically all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," heaven "and" better world. "</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also represents an excellent report, "" "" "" "" excellent, "" competent "and" understanding, "" "" "" "," the boys regularly comes with cakes, cookies and Bonbons and "always of grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is worth a minority about his PERFECTIONISM and its high emotional, which led to Wutausages even too.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only tell the chairs and the key words, but also earning spread to the hair, or ear, he has approached to the hair or ears, he himself worthed themselves before years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2921">In his honour, however, there must be said that such drawing methods in the survey time, the 1960s and 1970s, widely spread, with parents as at teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know even such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think anyone of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced that even in a worldwide school, experienced a state-Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to that, in order to be in this report, namely, the implementation of sexual abuse and violence at the preschool, the freilich Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Since it is questioned, whether there is no more likely to do with his confusion and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still eifrig.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report was Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report was reported very much about the topic abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also some paddle or co-ordinance with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clear no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual surviving claims to have rusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never confess to talk with my father or my mother," said one of the people, "It was me everything very much."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was, and yet it is that most victims from shame are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not commit their parents and siblings, then it was definitely not a choirmaster, who would have been working as a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How did the Domspatzen-Student Ratzingers Role in terms of the abuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionnaire formulated so: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case, in which he had been calculated (Georg Ratzinger) would have been able to maintain the particular perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I keep it... also for really absurd, assume that it looked after him... Buben einurgent or clearer or rather open, as opposed to their parents, boarding conductors, confidentists etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">With him over sex says... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus, the report about the very clear result: "that" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2942">In case of sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is freighted from any competence.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be accused of him, not prevents or to display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Hence, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradically crimes in conjunction, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was a lot of "nonviolence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">In the report "Wegener" was accused "by the previous Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this life?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in the reporting, everything was mixed and avoided to a giant melange from sexual abuse and violent exalted, and somewhere in the middle of drama Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separately: between the preschool and high school of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say, rest of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report from the time has been treated from the time since 1945, so that Georg Ratzinger was not Choral director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test matters, cases of cases of sadistical teachers are regulated and maligns, and among them, enacted all of them at the forestry in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really skies have to have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he received the boys on her face when she had already been on the cathedral-grade-grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, as most of the most witnesses came, the subject "Preschool" school. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to come to be and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraemic" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the domain-grade grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but there is no sadistical violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims of the general war of R. inspected and therefore, in many cases, despite violence even positive memories."</seg>
<seg id="2959">It remains at most of the design that looks away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two time periods, in which it was reported by the circumstances on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself, and from the vintages to a school which he was not effective and responsible, (so the witness) would not hear, and then it was back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger completed his ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which even reproduced its report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this point he indicates that in the preschool, the test penalty would continue to be practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of negative press release, he urgently need to intend.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was of course at a time, as a legal clarity, which were forbidden to be prohibited in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that she was in a legally grey zone, like everyone from us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult for him, where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatised, where really the admissible border was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it cannot say that he would have been swallowed away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">It is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to use today's educational standards on the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak historians from the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," so the danger of past to present moral measure after today's moral.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There has been the principality in law.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But that's not, of course, not for sexual abuse, who was discontinued at all times, and not for that which was interrupted in the preschool and violence against innocent children, that is already far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I'm glad that it is finally finished.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its funds to disciplinary and punishment, thus earposts and spread to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical punishment, then it was forbidden to be prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the picture of his Regensburger Georg Ratzinger in the discussions with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic test for the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it goes to the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, since the Domspatzen are only a supporting role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I still refrained from the way that he led there a strictly regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without these PERFECTIONISMUS, without the unconditional discipline, it would be hardly possible to go from that until then, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, you can now make no big singers and before any success, equal to what area, but always discipline, passion and self-negotiation.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what a man did you experienced Georg Ratzinger in her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have experienced Georg Ratzinger and always again as a wonderful, humorous and warm people, from which you can not imagine, that he could not allow me only a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domspatzen still comes today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly come to him, visit him, he is almost blind - and him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who are not forgiven to him today, that he was once strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are currently thankful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them the world of the music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, blessed teacher - a strenger father, certain, that may be, but also a lovable respectsperson, to which they still rise again, and to devour them again.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, even once again: all that you throws it, are expressing methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad, that we have been running this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it's highest unjust, a man only because he is well-prominent and a prominent brother, to the medial sinners.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands behind it, only too obviously.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just published, draws him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the association would be acquired, a 93-year-old man who has acquired a great member and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps there is no man to know the Regensburger Domspatzen in peace.</seg>
