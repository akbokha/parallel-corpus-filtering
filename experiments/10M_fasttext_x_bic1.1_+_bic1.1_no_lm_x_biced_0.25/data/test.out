Gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the p@@ iles of pyr@@ ite
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lang@@ er searched for some colleagues a bit changing with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after some minutes , the horses remember@@ ed her celebrations , they hunt for the fast g@@ allo@@ p home to the fe@@ eds .
a kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and thus ended the riding career again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again close by horses .
he left his family with his family over the Anlage of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he didn &apos;t go to photo .
long was the first time in Aachen , and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was conv@@ inc@@ ing .
the German sports aid assist@@ ed the man from An@@ hausen in a small Gala , the Golden sport p@@ iles .
on awards , it didn &apos;t pay the symp@@ ath@@ etic sport@@ sman .
German con@@ scienti@@ ous cross , silver bay leaf , Champions tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already bre@@ ed him .
the 18th winner of the sports p@@ ile is the 18th winner of the sports p@@ iles .
in Aachen , he met on Saturday the first winner of Hans Günter Winkler .
&quot; this award gives me very much , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; for it is not only for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er promot@@ es the off@@ spring .
and so he also received the prize money of 25.000 Euros .
with 15 more outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time winner of the German Sports &quot; Hall of Fame was incorpor@@ ated at the &quot; Hall of Fame of Fame &quot; in Saturday .
in the statement , the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schm@@ itt , who Turner Eberhard Gi@@ enger , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schm@@ itt , der Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , der Jud@@ ok@@ a Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ inkl@@ es Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and post@@ h@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard mar@@ vell@@ ous .
many of these sport@@ le@@ es were come to Aachen on Saturday , Aachen .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ator came into the jumping stadium , where the Lav@@ azz@@ a prize ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er spent distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps Eff@@ ects in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and invest@@ ing the TT@@ P &apos;s trade agreement - that &apos;s aim to prevent both Clinton and tr@@ ump .
however , in@@ one are the two US pre@@ sidency , however , in control and energy policies , as well as in a base question .
the distinc@@ tion in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a general , rather philos@@ oph@@ ical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep the dou@@ b@@ ts rather small and war@@ ned as the state of the economy can - with tax and regul@@ atory .
Clinton k@@ ins@@ em@@ ing the economy to death and regul@@ ating , he says .
he himself would be very different , claim@@ ing Tr@@ ump .
he will return regul@@ atory mas@@ sively , and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates , for professionals and businesses .
by contrast , Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to ful@@ fil , he has received not@@ if@@ ying opportunities and needs money .
therefore , the tax would be increased to the rich man , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the m@@ ute inv@@ ests , tr@@ ump and Clinton become almost wor@@ sen@@ ed .
the democratic candidates announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state Invest@@ ition@@ ers in infrastructure are the classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ based Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
in Tr@@ ump , there could still be part@@ ition@@ ed discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are significant .
tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and drive to the United States to drive back in the USA .
oil carriage is also possible to canc@@ el the areas in so protected areas , to canc@@ el the Paris climate agreement .
by contrast to their investment program , Clinton wants to expand the renewable energi@@ es and calls for : &quot; a country will create the super energy power and create a million jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it , that we are . &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two compet@@ itors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sec@@ tional trade agreements , don &apos;t want to sign .
at the same time , both the United States don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the international trade , but simply protect American jobs better .
those should also be paid better , calls for about Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump into this question is not very clear : once he says , The minimum wage must be , then he says , he should not be changed .
but the big discussion of the next months is likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on one side is tr@@ ump , who wants to increase the economy and citizens to increase the growth .
his cr@@ itic keep it before , so the budget defic@@ it would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants to pay at least from the rich man that they will pay more taxes , and their crit@@ ics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman @-@ flying woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost already for everyday life .
if they come in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
one house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ esses with great eyes curi@@ ous in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table top .
until they know that it is observed .
you sm@@ iled short and k@@ iss@@ ed the little ones .
scene affects normal .
until one speaks Katrin B@@ ahr .
it is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid in Bavaria , and employs among others with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are con@@ vol@@ atile .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ fled women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the setup together with Pro Famil@@ ia and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ances .
un@@ longest , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are no - not available as a visitor too .
the exception is a Wach@@ mann in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who made here comes along with sexual violence with sexual violence . &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they were polit@@ ically per@@ sec@@ uted , because they were killed or death , or because their families send them as a hope to Europe , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
in women , the other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they don &apos;t see any other out . &quot;
in her hom@@ eland , they have done experience with sexual violence , tw@@ ins , hon@@ our@@ ings , s@@ la@@ very , or forced pro@@ st@@ itution .
that drives them away .
on the run , the flight goes on .
&quot; for example , tu@@ g for a bottle of water a sexual action is not a rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected from their families .
whoever believe that the end as soon as they are in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
even here women would have under@@ taken women in refugee camps often as min@@ der@@ y and worse and worse .
this is that about 90 percent of women who live in the mouth of the Munich north , trau@@ mat@@ ised , it is estimated .
&quot; some of the children are not volun@@ tar@@ ily created . &quot;
many women may be so usual that they say nothing .
&quot; or they drink not , open about the explanation , because the shame is too big . &quot;
because they often do not help , it would need more accommodations for them , calls B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether they are w@@ aged from a similar project as in Munich in their breeding area , will answer some with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there is not something about the governments of governments .
in fact , women are not separated from the government alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
there are rooms only for all women and their children in a joint venture , district and central fran@@ ken .
the exception is Nieder@@ bayern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
the &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament will be asked that women are separated from men to be ho@@ used by men .
in a study that was published for the Committee , it is : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or become men and women have been ho@@ used together , it can come to - persist@@ ent violence against women . &quot;
especially the shower room should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
like very the women of this protection need@@ y , you can read at And@@ els , which there are at the house in Munich .
&quot; since it has talked about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one might make a second house easily .
Assist@@ ance @-@ denti@@ sts : financial assets after new emplo@@ yers of work
dep@@ uty of the assistant of assistant , their union team is called , new emplo@@ ying measures in their disp@@ utes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his entire Council , starting at the beginning of September more work campaign .
the J@@ DC said that it was administ@@ ered to the concerns relating to the Treaty regarding the Treaty .
assistant to the assistant of a contract , the BM@@ A was agreed on the dep@@ loyment of a contract .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who have voted the elections .
in a letter to the members who was released on Twitter on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC &apos;s Mc@@ Court , said that the government had remained calm &quot; at problems what the contract was rejected .
she said , &quot; In response , the J@@ DC Executive Board voted to re@@ ject the proposed new agreement and re@@ ject the official new treaty for all aspects . &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has made a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A procedure for a continuous operation process that starts at the beginning of September , appro@@ ve .
the disp@@ utes led to the disp@@ utes that assist@@ ed this year , six@@ teen years , the first total accid@@ ents in the history of N@@ HS .
after the election of the BM@@ A assistant , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , after the election of the agreed contract conditions that had been suggested by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took part in the vote by 54@@ 0,000 assistant , and was accepted by the contract that the contract should be advant@@ age@@ ous and accepted .
following the vote , the health minister Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the contract would be introduced to physi@@ ci@@ ans in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of external head@@ ers &quot; ?
it was a G@@ este that finished a crisis .
the leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give her hands and an official end of eight months of long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish action in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot teach me that Ankara re@@ conc@@ iliation this re@@ conc@@ iliation .
it was the hand , yes .
but putting a smile in smile , and he barely visible warm@@ th , even for his return conditions .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an was repeat@@ edly repeated by his &quot; love friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I couldn &apos;t count anymore .
he also said that the relation@@ ships in Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even to improve .
the next day described a newspaper that the Erd@@ og@@ an would have happened that would never happen to happen .
it seemed to me the enthusi@@ asm rather the opposite .
but one of Putin is ir@@ radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the state of Russia had not forgotten .
much rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , which he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of an Russian campaign bom@@ bers on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ able .
Putin divided from and acc@@ use Ankara , Russia into the back .
it was even greater , since it was committed by a supposed friend .
the show@@ case re@@ build again , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , unlimited attack on Ankara .
once it seemed to happen , the Turks would bear the Turks for everything .
in the most serious , the debt securities issued that geo@@ graphic has benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas Syri@@ ans who will receive the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he lo@@ dged this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was why Putin was held only because Putin received the president of Erd@@ og@@ an the exc@@ use , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an arm@@ ist@@ ice is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs first line all friends which he can get , after the last month at a failed coup led almost its amp@@ hi@@ ft .
repeated attacks on Turkey have also been sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economical mot@@ ives .
Russian sanctions have met Turkey hard - in particular the ban from charter flights , each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agent and charter companies will simp@@ lif@@ y if the flights may be res@@ umed .
they count on a late @-@ se@@ asonal cultiv@@ ation of the Mediterranean .
this week predicted the state television budget fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural flows will be admitted .
a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i form@@ ulated like this : &quot; tourists long , tomatoes for long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is due to the West , since its reaction to the attemp@@ ted was considered a weak response .
the persist@@ ing Gro@@ ll about the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to draw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , the Russian President of the Russian President won a bonus that he required for the chosen state aid for the chosen state organs .
that is well @-@ understanding of Moscow for Moscow also has a deep sitting an@@ xi@@ ety before reg@@ im@@ plants .
the summit in this gl@@ anced palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one , as it was described to me a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of foreign vers@@ aries &quot; depic@@ ted two countries that are cast off from the West and feel good .
non@@ eth@@ eless , despite the public re@@ conc@@ iliation , there are still great differences between the two still large differences .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace @-@ makers , but where Russia and Turkey support mut@@ ual pages .
it could be direc@@ tories that after almost three hours of their pre@@ sidents are coming on the press conference , that they could not stri@@ ped out the topic once again .
the President of Turkey ver@@ mi@@ ed it ab@@ id@@ ent on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to bet@@ w this .
it &apos;s not a clear con@@ sens@@ us about it , where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months , enemy swe@@ ets - and given the potential of the potential for a perfect disaster , as NATO member , Turkey , the Russian batt@@ lec@@ jet , it is certainly better to talk the two heads of state at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland outside Scotland is no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s predecessor , the Bank R@@ BS is supposed to be reduced to a back@@ office role on a back@@ office .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for clients outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland that was connected to the Bank R@@ BS with the global am@@ bul@@ ance of the Bank .
the bank has since been dist@@ ressed , when they had been almost collap@@ sed and saved years ago .
in this period , brand @-@ str@@ ate@@ ers &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other consumer budget brands .
they supported the international sport with millions pounds to Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by until Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to ren@@ ew more national brands in focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all R@@ s@@ b references , the de@@ central head@@ quarter and its IP@@ O will change to Nat@@ west .
the Tag Ul@@ ster Bank has already been used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer , which will get more significance - Cout@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand R@@ s@@ b will be employed to our investment brand , as well as the brand to be employed by our staff , since we will now be more to a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank himself became a global brand , R@@ BS has been a global brand .
I say now that we are not a global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will work in their own municip@@ alities for something completely different and our employees are working with customers with customers .
R@@ BS already told that there will be his six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing not anymore , and that it will increase the perc@@ ep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in his sport Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the bank of brands , because how to focus us in inside ( we asked them to make this to a better Bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief of Staff . &quot;
it would have been very angry for three years ago when we had said that we will have a great bank for our customers and have launched this brand .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , will see many changes .
we can re@@ med@@ itate this stamps , so I think that the time has come .

Russia became Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin was dis@@ missed by its Chief of Staff , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the most popular confi@@ denti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport ions .
in a statement of Kre@@ ml , it is that Putin without stated for reasons &apos; declar@@ ing its duties as Chairman of the Russian Pre@@ sidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been Vice @-@ Repres@@ ented since 2012 , was appointed as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in Tokyo .
on the site of Kre@@ ml it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later on the log manager of the head of the regime .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important role of government to support your activities as President of the Government and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
con@@ vin@@ ce the smile ?
in this step , Moscow made secre@@ tly est@@ ranged from Moscow .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the most tru@@ sted in Vladimir Putin and works for Soviet intelligence in the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
with a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed in television , both men had to return to their own request at his own request .
but despite the smile for cameras , there are only few of them conv@@ inces - especially in front of the parliamentary elections .
lies here the epis@@ ode of a kind of Ma@@ cht@@ kampf ?
the white currently no one .
but the official statement - that a man who once was appointed as a potential president , would like to guide the Russian environmental policy - going on great sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ sis .
in his remarks on Putin , who c@@ ited on the site of Kre@@ ml , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I have asked in a conversation that I could have been able to trust this very comp@@ lic@@ ated Post@@ en - they could almost say - weight of four years to trust .
as it represents , I have been chairman of the Russian Pre@@ sidential management for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov recorded the Post@@ en in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin was a former member of the State Security Service of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ onnel Manager ( FSB ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty chief representative .
when Putin was called upon the power , he called Ivan@@ ov than one of five people , to whom he tru@@ sted in most .
once , Ivan@@ ov was estimated that Ivan@@ ov could become the second term of Putin on Putin , since a third term served Putin against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , near the allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later .

the bridge section of Fif@@ e is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20.000 tons of concrete and 46 tra@@ ys .
the £ 1,35 billion will be completed by May 2017 .
in Keit@@ h Brown was granted a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first , which went down from the country on the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and sym@@ bo@@ lic moment at the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ er Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of a ver@@ ily part of a ver@@ ily ep@@ ic measures in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the strength is between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
a total of almost 79 % of the total bridge covers in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete deck for the Deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of pione@@ ering portrait and dr@@ en@@ bau .
after installation of the last road cut and its connection with the expansion in the expansion , we had to close the existing gap on the North or land .
this was reached by pul@@ ling the northern point bridge over 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very hei@@ ms at the same time .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 222 meters long is approx . 6.000 tons weighs and at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % to the top had to be moved .
when toler@@ ances , because the toler@@ ances where the team work , tiny - on each side , they were only some milli@@ meters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily ran all very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happ@@ iness still alive &quot;
three men have been alive to be alive , after they were cast out of their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI life@@ jacket passed on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ St Alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had trouble in safety to sw@@ im , while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat was in its proximity to the turning , and set us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the life station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; lu@@ ck@@ ily , the strong winds m@@ ills the boat already except their range , until we left to water , &quot; added .
two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ man , while the third man were exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and found one bo@@ ost@@ s without life@@ jacket .
they came all on board of the coastal pass@@ over and were brought back to the rescue station .
Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who have thrown into the water , have good fort@@ une and still life to life .
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this sol@@ ving itself when the boat was added to the boat from the person , which controls the boat .
someone has ended today about these men .
seri@@ ously wounded - man st@@ ems on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seri@@ ously wounded .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had to get the keys to get the keys to get his personal things .
instead of the alcohol @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , instead of the alcohol @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when this came into the apartment , he st@@ akes twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured on the hand and injured .
the police could take the per@@ pet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old , the clothing of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend destroyed his mother .
this al@@ arm@@ oured his sister .
together with her living , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old would so@@ othing her brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her living being out of the house .
on the road they met the Ex @-@ lifetime of the man .
when the two women bet@@ rot@@ ates the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old has his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds brown @-@ welding apartments ?
the SPD and regards to mine , Invest@@ ors shall be taken in the future to the oblig@@ ation .
how do you respon@@ d to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments ?
the SPD pro@@ poses a &quot; hand @-@ meeting concept in the next turn .
but war is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the che@@ aper fl@@ ats ?
a provision is missing so far .
Christoph Fr@@ mann &apos;s party whi@@ p : &quot; we have to build us with the Green Party : who wants to build on urban areas , future 20 percent of all apartments as a social apartments . &quot;
however , the favour@@ able apartments can also be created in stock .
the great disp@@ ute in the town hall , however , as the Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are you want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to provide investors at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 percent of the apartments build as a social apartments . &quot;
a new town @-@ residential construction program , which will cost € million and is to be fin@@ anced , should provide for strike .
the problem , so viol@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fr@@ actions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to submit investors as a few provisions .
Lin@@ ke inten@@ ds to boost the hardness for investors .
this , as the viol@@ as , as a bu@@ id@@ ing the situation of the situation in the housing market .
will be implemented for additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear that we will get the professionals .
yet the program does not work , because the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built into ohn@@ eh@@ in .
but how to do the loss of more about 1,@@ 300 che@@ aper fl@@ ats , whose promotion is going to run in the next years ?
there are 500 apartments for the year 2020 alone .
in order to prevent this , the plan@@ etary spokes@@ person for Nicole Palm , should now be bought up out of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to re@@ cover apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
on a blow , the problem is solved .
because in the west city run for the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments could go there back to the price for cheap apartments .
only : this is the owners , non @-@ residential companies .
for the number of social apartments in the West@@ stadt has recovered dra@@ st@@ ically , one is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called feed mixture .
there is no concentration of social weak in just a few distri@@ cts , it is no longer give .
the green light reck@@ on that there is still a motion in the discussion .
party whi@@ p Holger Her@@ lit@@ schke said : &quot; for a wide majority need the CD@@ U with the boat . &quot;
it is concentrated on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a com@@ promise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happ@@ iness , worth it
it is fascinating , how the world changed .
that teenage children and child is not able to go outside , but rather will prefer to spend their free time to deal with screens , has been dis@@ rup@@ ted during the last decade .
for Pok@@ em@@ on Go , people go to fet@@ ch people from the sofa and to be active .
the time at the screen at the beginning of the TV was limited to video , and then limited to smart@@ phones .
therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not complete each other .
I be@@ ck@@ led me of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters in the 1990s ( later a character set , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenom@@ ena of the Pop@@ k@@ ultur the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go again had more users as a T@@ inder , and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players will go out with their smart phones and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that were taken with a GPS , once they were found once again , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; caught . &quot;
one generation that played the game , when she was younger , she graduated from the W@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps , which makes the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ques , a app for Apple Watch , the 35,000 users pro@@ sec@@ uted the Washington Post recently , that within two days after the market launch of the game , the number of participants followed up every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company knows not , who plays poker é@@ mon Go - it can only look up the raw data for performance .
many public ex@@ plan@@ atory t@@ amp@@ ers to health , people want to take care about 30 minutes , &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; every day are active . &quot; because many public messages are subject to health bor@@ ing and out of people who look forward .
non@@ eth@@ eless , the importance of sport can not be reviewed .
who regularly drives Sport drives , reduces its opportunities to explore cancer or de@@ pression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list to share which is too long to perform them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , making them fun .
thus , three pillars of the health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people close up on the hunt even new friends .
as always there is m@@ ür@@ ric play@@ sp@@ ell , which must always compl@@ ain about anything .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a break@@ through .
even if your smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit already follow our activity , they gave us not a reason to drive sports as it does this game .
the New will lose its kingdom and the use will be retro@@ fitted with the time .
however , due to the gam@@ em@@ ons success , it will give more games to make apps and virtual reality with the activation in the real world and can help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the print .
forget the Hy@@ pe .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the immune .
dynamic in the jumping horse .
eff@@ ort@@ less@@ ly on the beam .
breath@@ taking on the ground .
on full line brilliant .
and finally Olympic winner .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the sur@@ f@@ ights and enlar@@ ged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the front light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was evi@@ dent ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ enk@@ sk@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal at Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tower on the Swedish bal@@ es during the single multi@@ focal point of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual amer@@ ican , which wins a multi @-@ t@@ amp@@ er and a total of the fifth , while they give their rep@@ utation , the best of their generation , or even at all .
she broke out in te@@ ars , when her final score was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
this success proved them in the same League as a unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports cards to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated their athl@@ ete , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals from the 1984 Mary Lou Res@@ c@@ ue who said the best gymn@@ ast in 1984 , that I ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast in which I ever seen . &quot;
it &apos;s expected to take a final ex@@ am in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered to be dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s poor , after they have made gold and silver in the individual multi@@ focal point of women in the summer season 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday and won .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while on the f@@ are@@ well party of retirement in retirement , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a re@@ cover sign .
although it existed on the top of its long distance to the top , never the future planned , isn &apos;t it really true .
part of its floor sessions - which contains their typical tumor pas@@ sport watch - is well @-@ mat@@ ched to Latin American music that would be home outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , which was adopted by their grand@@ parents as a little child , and from train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother was discovered during a school hall in the gym hall , in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained .
since the summer of 2013 , it has no sur@@ prising competition more , a winning stre@@ ak , which is so long as it wishes it .
even when Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two l@@ ungs the picture .
Swe@@ et@@ bal@@ es and Bod@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen - in which the world champion keeps the world champion .
they got again with 15,@@ 433 on the swe@@ ets again - and set up a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man re@@ arm@@ oured them gently as her dis@@ pat@@ ched - a pure form@@ ality - and te@@ ars ap@@ ric@@ ted on Bil@@ ly gloss red , white and blue Eyel@@ iner , when the vision was described in her sc@@ book , to reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a re@@ ven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she was fighting for the third place , but the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old cre@@ denti@@ als involved , which is called by American &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; an advantage .
after their flooring , she cast the audience to the audience , over@@ whel@@ med by a com@@ eb@@ ack that was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful .
in the beginning of this week , the Pas@@ sion of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very important role in the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series production at the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot in one of the dead@@ ly attacks of Phoenix , while they heard in the car and heard music .
Angela Merkel Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot up on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a par@@ aben , said the authorities .
the per@@ pet@@ rified eight shots of a hand@@ fire bowl , while on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle , is then read in the report .
the police reported that the tri@@ ples did not have the result of a pre@@ cip@@ itation everything seems , since the att@@ ack@@ ers didn &apos;t have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the Poli@@ ce@@ ans by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told that the shooting of the investig@@ ator led the investig@@ ators to become a n@@ igh@@ tly view if it is connected with four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed in nine &apos;s three months , and two further injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard der K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown youth from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ator refused to submit evidence that they were linked to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and of the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their inju@@ ries , and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah still died on the spot .
a witness to the police , that it was not unusual for her to sit in a good car and listen to music .
the authorities published a police report about the shooting , which was an empty car pick@@ up from the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of serial production .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball frag@@ ments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ie : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ uto did the sing , to@@ ys and of course his mother .
but as the least one of his age , Edmund Mikro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic dis@@ order that did not know about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time at home , my first thought I did not create .
I do not create .
I don &apos;t let me down .
what it is not true -- of course it is left on it , she said .
her husband Vincent and her was informed that Edmund she can never recognize it under circumstances and that he may not appear once again .
some doctors went even so far that they pre@@ dict him to institu@@ tional .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Edmund can run with a help .
Edmund was able to sit down to his third year of life or sitting down , and he still cannot speak .
but he makes slow progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also love to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which was Edmund for &quot; Please sing to me a bit before . &quot;
&quot; we give him a language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not a typical character language -- says it . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ie has a variety of causes : genetic like Edmund as well as inf@@ ections with viruses like Mas@@ ks or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still to say early as it is influ@@ enced by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus Inf@@ ections .
Pic@@ ci@@ ans re@@ members the emot@@ ional price of an un@@ certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t know it really .
I have been asked more after the pro@@ gn@@ osis since long time because I did not expect a man really say .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has caused a hop@@ eful ra@@ inf@@ all for mot@@ hers of inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe ra@@ inf@@ encies , flo@@ oding are occasion to b@@ ail@@ ments in Louis@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
severe ra@@ inf@@ encies and large flo@@ ods in Louis@@ iana tw@@ aves the Govern@@ or , on Friday the emergency call to call for more ra@@ inf@@ all of more ra@@ inf@@ all .
many rivers in the south @-@ east Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is over@@ flo@@ oded their banks and above flo@@ ods with large flo@@ ods , reported the National weather service .
the Govern@@ or of Louis@@ iana John Bel Edwards told , that state was standing in the constant contact with local authorities and help to the affected con@@ greg@@ ations already .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emerg@@ ency Prepar@@ edness of the governor , divided the requests for flood vehicles , boats and Sandbags ,
Ste@@ ele said that the church of Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand supp@@ orters .
a flood flow system will be used over wide range of Louis@@ i@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service provided that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches would fall to rain .
in the south , Alab@@ ama was used on Friday a flo@@ odlight system , while in the field of Mobile .
the Com@@ ite river near B@@ aton Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , will reach all prob@@ ability after the weekend at a record level .
the Met@@ ast@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could find many houses in the subur@@ b near B@@ aton Rouge .
he also said that a river @-@ down miss@@ ile in@@ undation in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish has a danger that these streams will only be slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level by 09.00 for the highest level ever recorded .
Res@@ c@@ ue ste@@ ams are still people from the flo@@ oded water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the South West of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Le@@ Roy Hans@@ ford , his wife and his St@@ ie@@ fs@@ ohn were among those that were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water by Be@@ aver Cre@@ ek , that is usually more than 400 feet from his house , at night &apos;s rise .
he said that another St@@ ie@@ fs@@ ohn , who dwell@@ eth near , were war@@ ned .
&quot; we are infl@@ amed and war@@ med up the water , &quot; Hans@@ ford .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years , in which she lived there , never had seen such a state of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have any dis@@ abilities and he of the only thing that can sw@@ im .
Hans@@ ford said , Not@@ with@@ ers have saved all three in a large military trucks and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flo@@ oding was going fast , &quot; because there was still severe ra@@ inf@@ encies , and that the authorities ev@@ acu@@ ation instructions can be applied .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann a ob@@ server near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been considerably worse since Wednesday .
the authorities suggested that severe ra@@ inf@@ encies and road flo@@ ods from their houses in Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and the pro@@ ud@@ dle in five school groups caused by their houses in Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa 200 survived houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which now have both over@@ flo@@ ods .
the rul@@ er of the congregation of Ro@@ bby Miller said that the authorities have saved 72 people , and seven pets are saved by the flood .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emerg@@ encies were furnished to har@@ bor the ev@@ acu@@ ated .

in the city of Ham@@ mond the Municip@@ ality of Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa were closed almost two d@@ utz@@ ing roads because of the flood , they hope for the residents that hope to provide water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last great flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the town administration .
this seems to be a similar incid@@ ent .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp he said the emergency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys that it remains at the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful houses have been reported on Thursday as a superior level , but there were no sign up until now .
Keit@@ h Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value Fo@@ ods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water at places , where I have never seen it , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and there is still &quot; &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; made by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy appeared in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents issued that Brown suffered several shots , including in the run@@ ners , leg , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport to hospital at consci@@ ousness .
&quot; he has done much , his little body was sol@@ dered of balls , &quot; divided his grand@@ mother of Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez for the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boys of the boys was assigned in a hospital as a critical , and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family &apos;s family divided the transmitter that it is expected to stop again .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who lived in German@@ town .
also , three men were killed : two aged 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical state ; the other two victims are stable in the stable condition .
the boy was found on the front of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical state , was found in the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police have been determined that under one of the last men of the per@@ pet@@ rators could be found .
investig@@ ator distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it was apparent to a cru@@ el fire between several arch@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , they were per@@ sec@@ uted for different assault rif@@ le , par@@ alys@@ ed the facts .
it seems that it is clearly about an and@@ ul@@ ing battle .
on the road , on both sides of the way , H@@ ül@@ sen were moved .
so it seems to have been given several armed figh@@ ters who were very active , &quot; divided police corne@@ al Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the field .
there came to no doubt and exam@@ ine the police reports to review the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross country on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the area of West Oak Lane .
she recovered himself and the police are looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie need
that &apos;s what I present myself under the Frauen@@ ol@@ ann@@ ick in the Tur@@ ns and consists of more than a reason .
first , I joined every summer games since 1984 and the United States had never been domin@@ ant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Laur@@ en &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin paint .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ üd@@ in is and Mad@@ ison Ko@@ cian , the Cat@@ holic@@ s is going , making each proud .
this team refle@@ cts the USA .
it has set the black and h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ning inside a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows might .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas , Gab@@ by Douglas was celebrated a sur@@ prising Olympic and America .
now the world was able to be a witness of the three @-@ fold world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas , and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they were un@@ expected , but most of the Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ic@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman was awarded at an individual multi @-@ day event for women in gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sports , but they are not seen in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Mad@@ ison to create it to the olymp@@ ic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics are only four gymn@@ ast in the crew . moreover , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is a expensive sports and Turner first line in private gym , that cost of the parents , facilities , travel , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . the list can continue to continue .
the majority of these s@@ orts are in we@@ alth@@ y suburbs , which can support the business .
in these promises , the Turner will get its total training and that is for families a te@@ ures and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer from Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both their athl@@ ete , since they started with the Tur@@ ns .
we must be inspired by the churches of Au@@ n , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a be@@ ading and easier access .
I founded my g@@ ades of 20 years ago .
we have commanded free and affordable turbines in Harlem for over 15,000 urban adol@@ esc@@ ents ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic ) and national and international winners .
in September we will expansion to Detroit ( my home town ) to provide the youth @-@ qualit@@ ative turbo@@ charged gymn@@ ast , who earn the opportunity to learn from this amazing Olympic sports .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordin@@ ation for the body and hard work , discipl@@ ine and cri@@ p@@ ity for the Spirit .
this combination offers a li@@ fel@@ ong benefits for health and professional success .
it is the in@@ spiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to care for the Tur@@ ns and that &apos;s great .

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness claims to bl@@ ossom sugar level in Muslim areas
the former may@@ or of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was arrested last year on the release of a government report for cor@@ ruption of the office .
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led that far @-@ wide turn@@ out election was ignor@@ ated in Muslim communities like a devast@@ ating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric P@@ ickl@@ es susp@@ ects the police , constitu@@ ent and Rath@@ es for this purpose , evidence of Ele@@ ction ab@@ use due to &quot; over@@ sensitive to Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot;
the former minister for integration and commun@@ al government , which is now an anti @-@ cor@@ ruption of religious mot@@ ifs so bad that it should be allowed to establish the police , shut @-@ off outside of electoral kab@@ ines , to protect vot@@ ers .
he re@@ commen@@ ds that vot@@ ers should lead a identification card to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment , a vot@@ ers must call only his name and address .
the report suggest@@ s , not dist@@ ant ink on the finger of a person , if they give her choice to prevent someone is cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should receive more protection , Sir Eric says .
he tells us that the press has more access to common documents and decisions of not official comm@@ itt@@ ance or working groups .
&quot; this is not only true to election , but also the municipal government in front of the spread of cor@@ ruption and financial officer , which goes on to protect , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election to the East London .
last year , a special selection committee decided that the am@@ bus@@ y may@@ or l@@ ut@@ er for Rah@@ man after a lit@@ an@@ ei to cor@@ rupt and illegal intern@@ s .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had managed the religious fe@@ el@@ ings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he had brought his cr@@ itic with rac@@ ial sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ olog@@ ians to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis , that it may be reli@@ ev@@ ous of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the epis@@ ode of a night , when someone else cho@@ oses one person .
Sir Eric said that it might be in the whole country for fr@@ aud .
he sold himself especially al@@ arm@@ ing to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letter - when the older members of the Muslim community had made people to people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to prove the turn@@ out system , including the leaders of identity to prove the identity .
in his report it says : &quot; as a proof that pressure on the need@@ y members were committed to some ethnic min@@ orities , especially women and young people to choose according to the Will of Elder , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Alban@@ ian background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behaviour due to &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; over@@ sensitive to eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
Sir Eric says 50 recommendations made to bu@@ yers the system , including the ban , that political activ@@ ists work may work to stop &quot; vot@@ ive . &quot;
the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May , requires even har@@ der registration data to prevent that the key directory will be used for immig@@ ration and social sharing .
cho@@ os@@ ing options , vot@@ ers ask for your choice .
not removed ink on the finger of a person once they gave their voice to prevent someone is cho@@ oses twice .

demands that only English may be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensive of the exercis@@ ing to ensure that the employees are generally transl@@ ating that vot@@ ers go alone into the turn@@ out cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; aston@@ ishing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets Case was no pun@@ ished .
&quot; the Ele@@ ction Court has Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty president on cor@@ rupt and illegal intern@@ ships as an unknown . &quot; he said .
he was found guilty due to a series of reasons for en@@ rich@@ ment - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ izes the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ control &quot; of the qualification dep@@ artments of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court decision in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and dis@@ covered the spread of electoral fr@@ ying and Le@@ ug@@ ation of some authorities stric@@ tly thre@@ aten these good rep@@ utation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ doubles and other famous double @-@ stri@@ ans of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ folios in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week over the French wheel athl@@ ete from Pauline Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of edge and band that has proven itself as an impressive double @-@ shape of the Duke of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is not far the only one , to make gold fighting Ath@@ l@@ ete , who has his own famous double @-@ stri@@ ans - at least , if one must give the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently created on our screens , the FE@@ MA@@ IL created a lists at the Olympi@@ on@@ iken , which has more than just a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity with Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ famous pages .
the hun@@ ts@@ man and the Wolf : man @-@ member of the U.S. crew in Archery Br@@ ady El@@ l@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since its childhood .
apart from K@@ ates double @-@ shape on the bicycle race , many people left on the Internet as a certain arch@@ ers of the Zw@@ illing of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the European team member of the U.S. crew in Archery Br@@ ady El@@ l@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght of Twitter , after images that he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness to the social media in social media , and gave that he has been able to hear from his childhood since his childhood .
&quot; I myself see no big simil@@ ar@@ ity , with the exception of the face de@@ ar@@ ung , &quot; divided Br@@ ady at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a gut@@ ted guy , so I think it is probably as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ is@@ ons since London in 2012 , this year will definitely come to the centre : the impressive simil@@ ar@@ ity between the British expan@@ se Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian Tur@@ ning in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , ex@@ pres@@ sive eyes is supposed to pass as a double @-@ shape for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African Schw@@ immer Cameron is compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actors
another important comparison was taken between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has severe eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver medal sw@@ immer in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ brow@@ nish skin and bl@@ on@@ hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ al@@ yn@@ ne Mc@@ Cord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ est@@ ated , an &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial shape and eyes
not the only : a Twitter user was very happy about that other simil@@ ar@@ ities are also risen !
commissioned in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for simil@@ ar@@ ity of the Pa@@ ares , perhaps a reason
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared its happ@@ iness that &quot; the rest of the Internet think that Hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredi@@ bly similar fac@@ ial shape and eyes .
another popular compar@@ ative K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and their smile , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Turin Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own wonderful , wide smile shows that it res@@ em@@ bles from Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

bu@@ yer in Pri@@ mark trad@@ ed over women who under@@ wear the middle at the shop in the shop
the bu@@ yer didn &apos;t know where they should see when a woman moved out of a priest in the midst of a priest to try .
in order to wor@@ sen@@ ed the situation , they were p@@ added , as she saw it , she moved back and put it back into the shelf .
she felt and tast@@ ed four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , on .

she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the midst of the sales area , it took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the situation , moved to their own sh@@ orts and trousers , and tast@@ ed them .
&quot; she was not tried to find something dis@@ cre@@ as to do it , to do it - it was just there , fre@@ ch as Oskar . &quot;

Ms. David@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , the staff tries to draw from the sale when she went - what is the same thing . &quot;

how to protects against Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it something safe for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers on the distance .
regardless of how to show you from the front or from the back , you will show this video as you turn off for your rob@@ bers .
if you ref@@ igh@@ ted from the back , then you should turn aside as the first , so you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and &quot; from the Line of Fire , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your front @-@ poor and your shoulder , before you beat him with your free el@@ bows .
beat him then with the kne@@ e into the l@@ ust and turn , while the att@@ ack@@ ers come together before pain prev@@ ails the weapon of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move the weapon for him .
with att@@ acking , the technique is similar - move your body from the Line of Fire , take the weapon and turn them , so the att@@ ack@@ ers cannot shoot .
leave the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon of its grip before they move back and make the weapon on him .
sounds hard ?
check out the video to see exactly what is Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is on the saf@@ est to over@@ throw your money - if you don &apos;t have any Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
watching Ian Wright for a guide to his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British pas@@ sion@@ er under@@ went the immune system and dig@@ n@@ flex of a serious testing - breaking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and wor@@ th@@ est places in Europe .
the Moder@@ ator and it@@ iner@@ ary Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ sent its course on a Euro Sch@@ ein , a ban@@ ker on the Pic@@ cad@@ illy Cir@@ cus , a rins@@ ing button in Russia as well as public telephone in Russia to provide the resistance of his immune system .
before leaving each object , he used a Lumin@@ ometer to show herself and to show us what he will leave .
but the experim@@ ent , titled &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; was in@@ filtr@@ ated , brought some sur@@ prising results to the daylight .
the thought , the rins@@ ing button of a train toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , can be completely de@@ grad@@ ably , but actually in a kitchen molecules more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with medical and medical specialist on the promotion of int@@ est@@ ak@@ ter@@ ies , as well as his own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , nothing left , what he was built , more than a bad re@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his int@@ est@@ ms by taking the world , as well as wonderful things as well as wonderful things .
by public Gel@@ alter in railway stations up to rin@@ se the task , the task ordered his immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ owned , what my health affects and I have put all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ coff@@ e@@ water . &quot;
in the film he was just@@ ified in his rep@@ utation .
the only thing that he re@@ jects , was a dir@@ ty public toilet in Russia .
its propor@@ tions showed a lumin@@ ometer value of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the Lumin@@ omet@@ rics are fresh@@ ly woven hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to rep@@ et@@ ly after its lumin@@ ance of 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands a less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturers of da@@ iry products produced V@@ ali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength , which shows the bacter@@ ial number of different places like the bathroom .
in the movie he says : &quot; it comes to the worst , what I got into a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will find nothing here , because it is dr@@ unk here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturers of da@@ iry products V@@ ali@@ o .
the company took Mr. Wright with V@@ ali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both mil@@ it@@ arian bacteria and vitamin C and D , to support the promotion of int@@ est@@ inal bacteria and immune system .
V@@ ali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer something new in the consumer .
anything that is fascinating to view and explains the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings caused by that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest is applied to a global phenom@@ enon
instead of just over the products , we wanted to provide them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of int@@ est@@ inal health and how they linked with the immune system .
the growing interest in the int@@ est@@ inal health is a global phenom@@ enon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information on an interesting way .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense for hum@@ or !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let it be lost me to Ian , if he would have taught my respect for Ian , if he would have taught him , as the same Russian toilet , which is shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there was things that it was easier to bring Ian in which it was quite difficult to meet them and others , in which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we have taken some of these dir@@ ty le@@ ak@@ ies on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by V@@ ali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi are particularly associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and Dar@@ m and 58 per cent , that they contain at least occasionally products that contain lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

DONNA Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , works for the household administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it fe@@ ars not to repair the apartment .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare , and I am the view that people have not to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account , since this estate is probably considered to be nice part Corn@@ elius .
the family is inf@@ am@@ ous and their rep@@ utation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror , who had added the family , dro@@ pping the family with bas@@ eb@@ all , dro@@ pping and exc@@ essive cry , scatter@@ ing and flu@@ ids .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the le@@ ase Agreement , got a arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ zi@@ al behaviour in June .

there were also been in the estate where they were stu@@ ff@@ ed in the past drugs , the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ ps are torn in the past .
neigh@@ bo@@ urs said that they saw them on the street , and regularly they had to be called the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ed her and their partner this week from the property , after they gave them extended period of 11 weeks to give them up volun@@ tar@@ ily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were aston@@ ished by refresh@@ ed neigh@@ bo@@ urs , they said that their life was made to hell .
a said , &quot; They were sl@@ ain about it . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and there was always bad .
the count@@ less times that we say the police here , are un@@ belie@@ vable .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not been staying alive !
now , where they are finally away , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fitzpatrick , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ for@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it was to co@@ operate the family with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , led to the police in regular intervals , 20 years long .

I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the congregation , who have come to us on us and have sent to us the information .
I hope that this development will sp@@ reads some neigh@@ bo@@ urs , and the message does not pres@@ erve that ant@@ aneous behaviour is not toler@@ ated .

Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ amed ″ massive problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans is s@@ acked by massive car@@ es , also in a conservative state of their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave the weak@@ ness of his election campaign in the current Repub@@ lican High burg Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment , in which normally gener@@ ously spl@@ endid and self @-@ safe mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire so something like concerns sold , such as Cor@@ respon@@ dents reported .
after he threw 16 ri@@ vals within the own repub@@ lican camp , the dou@@ b@@ ts still grow in his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have massive problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before the ev@@ angel@@ ical Christians who made support for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
gu@@ ilt reports are false reports about his candi@@ da@@ cy , he returned to his familiar media .
repub@@ lican High bur@@ ns
Ut@@ ah is normally a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June to June according to Tr@@ ump and his cur@@ ves by the Dem@@ oc@@ rat , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other Institute see Tr@@ ump into front , but not with the distance that are common for repub@@ lican candidates in the state of usual .
more Arizona and Georgia are considered end@@ ang@@ ered .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ator CNB@@ C responded to Tr@@ ump on the question how he would stop the ancest@@ or Clin@@ ics again : &quot; just as I have made it yet so far . &quot;
and if back : I will be either successful , or I will make a very very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he will make nothing else to tell the truth . &quot;
in case it was not rich in order for him on the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this was fine , said tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way .
according to the press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump was threatened to submit to the support of his election campaign , he should not be able to present a better conversion values .
instead of his wool , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans are stronger among the arms .

I would say that we really have Bern@@ stein music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a older age of Mary .
she remin@@ ds with W@@ eh@@ mut to her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fas@@ c@@ inated me .

and then there would be Mari@@ as Person@@ ality .
she tells you in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is cle@@ ver , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very pas@@ sion@@ ate .
&quot; it is similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have seen as the Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of the opera singer for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honour for us to work with her .
it is a mon@@ ster @-@ gener@@ ous man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very pas@@ sion@@ ate ! &quot;
conductor is for him a need .
you can see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion , and also a happy approach to life , that &apos;s very important !
by the American Director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; at this piece : &quot; in this piece it is about advantages and Fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
today we have walked the refugees at that time , the Pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ik@@ aner went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t wanted them .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish comm@@ une is calculated with mass destruction
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t miss and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed caff@@ old , &quot; says the Pre@@ sidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation dialogue and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish community Germany lasts short @-@ term , with tens of thousands of protection , which fled from Turkey to Germany .
in the middle of medium there could even be &quot; some hundreds of hundreds &quot; believed to the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the har@@ vest@@ ment of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt to take refuge in Germany a mass refuge in Germany .
in short notice , I have ten thousands of thousands , medium @-@ term , with some hundreds of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the min@@ ority regime fought the min@@ ority groups and democratic opposition , &quot; says the &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had been over@@ hau@@ led before months before months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds came in Turkey during the escape .
after the lost coup , p@@ utsch was still su@@ icide and the Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle ethnic Turks .
many will begin to start in Europe when they are going to be expressed in Turkey .
&quot; it can not be that a state who decre@@ ases to refugees in the own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
the commander of the government accused of Syrian Arab Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ical cities .
in order to raise petro@@ leum to the remaining cur@@ d to the remaining cur@@ ves .
&quot; they are the last great min@@ ority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Gre@@ eks were cut out already in the past hundred years or distributed , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
the government of directors declar@@ es that the Federal Government shall be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his pendant . &quot;
in Germany , a &quot; Hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an crit@@ ics took place in Germany .
in the last months , I feel no longer secure in Germany in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also re@@ fe@@ ared the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are searching for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
the fire mark@@ ings as Gü@@ len char@@ ms destroy teachers and other academ@@ ics .
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t miss and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed caff@@ old , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and so@@ oth@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len appro@@ aches &quot; dialogue and education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper stated on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Ministry , the Turks had already reported the largest group of alleged per@@ secution in Germany before the coup against political per@@ secution .
at the reporting date June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all as@@ sured accepted ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
in this point it does not find the war , poverty or Perspek@@ tiv@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
asylum is entitled to the Basic Law , according to the Basic Law , thus from a state side , individually per@@ sec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern : &quot; then go , where to do it &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern : get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holidays from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not choose the land day .
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern .
in 2021 the land@@ line will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the sever@@ ity parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
because Bl@@ ö@@ der than until now it is not : summer holidays , heat and land battle .
the secret that are convinced by the election campaign are to be convinced of the holiday .
most beautiful holiday that are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a secret , so not to choose the country .
in addition , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ per , the posters hang on air bal@@ lo@@ ons , flyer , and will count towards the end of votes , only ti@@ red .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern must still be en@@ chan@@ ting just under the people over the people .
the hot phase if you can say that it has just started .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U alition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 has become the strongest party , is now clear behind the CD@@ U .
exciting Af@@ D cuts as strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and remain silent at the end of the co@@ alition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , he has an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive election campaign , sees one of his major posters .
he travels across the country , spread horses and pl@@ ains a little with the people , as it is also his legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sail@@ ors get cold feet and gives law Merkel at the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We create &quot; I have to acceler@@ ate the ascent of the Law@@ sp@@ op@@ u@@ lists , which is now considered to be the beautiful office .
the CD@@ U with its top training data , the Minister Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if you do at wrong time at the right place .
she has invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to major documents ; Merkel parliament &apos;s parliament on the North East .
but the target group agree there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Sachsen as M@@ eckl@@ en@@ burger and Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern , recently in N@@ DR .
but it seemed too bad to hear from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel hear .
apart from the North East @-@ CD@@ U largely , the North East @-@ CD@@ U are largely on the usual election campaign and shopping centers with par@@ um@@ bre@@ ll@@ as and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
that , it &apos;s co@@ sting , play only one &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union also has reported that you have to destroy the base the base that it must be very hard to find out a wire to the people again .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Green Party : hardly available in the times of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U parliamentary election is also self @-@ auth@@ ori@@ ous : &quot; you have to go , where they are we@@ ep , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gold wed@@ dings , each birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering is called for a particularly dedicated campaign .
in surve@@ ys , the S &amp; Ds was last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clear with 35,@@ 6 percent in the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in the qu@@ eries , allow you to create the jump to the country .
they make a modern T@@ ug@@ end in the holidays @-@ not a modern T@@ ug@@ end and maintain their campaign .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it is called Claudia Müller .
otherwise green electoral blo@@ ody on track tests on trace mix@@ ers are among the holiday .
Silke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , kur@@ v@@ t just with a house boat through the m@@ eckl@@ ist lakes and finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern is not Pun@@ ishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabil@@ itation : Gast@@ stätten suffering under locking
at the speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ers .
for the work of construction work to begin at 5.30 o &apos;clock in the morning and only at 8 pm , there are all praise .
&quot; they made everything quite angry , &quot; told El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet petrol station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no adjustment .
construction site could be re@@ located on the mid@@ day to the half @-@ time scheduled to be transferred to the south , until the end of October , everything is scheduled .
the ent@@ ob@@ t will also be the opposite of the construction work , for example , if it passes the institu@@ tion of containers .
since the construction site has been applied on Monday to the south , and also the pl@@ ywood of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been re@@ constructed in the resort .
the citizens can now go on both sides by O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen , from B 27 on both sides .
the travel through the place seems to be back .
since there were partly significant compl@@ aints , &quot; says that responsible for the traffic management of the Rehabil@@ itation manager Florian King .
the vill@@ agers of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to battle with more traffic noise , because many bar@@ rage sought and rather their Nav@@ i tru@@ sted as the signs .
in addition to this , some trucks appeared in the areas of rural areas .
since the speed limit could not be observed , the assembly has strengthened the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were significant consider@@ ations , &quot; says King , who made itself once more on the location on the location .
two to three per minute has been heated , there are already two to three per minute .
the speed was on the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone with a speed of 77 km / h .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become quiet .
for the business level at B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is open to the road again .
into the cards , busin@@ ess@@ man don &apos;t like to look back .
but that the B 27 san@@ itation has led them to sales in sales , each one can ask you .
however , some more and some are affected .
if you have to do with the &quot; final customer &quot; less to do , so for other companies , the renovation has hardly any consequences .
Thomas Sul@@ z is also at the Auto@@ haus Ma@@ ier with a &quot; maximum slight decrease , but also a fact that of course , &quot; the drive is missing . &quot;
at the most explo@@ ited are the local road along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
that is already existing in exist@@ ent .
not just him , but all host@@ esses it was hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ ate@@ eil .
we have to be glad about every euro .
the sales in revenue was over 50 percent . &quot;
the tr@@ ens@@ ation have thrown his operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to dis@@ missed the half of his staff .
when I had a company with 4,000 employees and the half would have been dis@@ missed , the policy would have been re@@ acted differ@@ ently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt is on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there is a financial compensation that would answer to the advantage of the location , the host of the location on the B 27 . now , they are even the draw@@ back@@ s that give thanks to the san@@ itation .
G@@ öh@@ ner white from other land cir@@ cles , where a little more gener@@ ous hand@@ led was .
in all case , G@@ öh@@ ner is safe that his restaurant will continue .
finally , the family business has been located at 17@@ 15 here , and refers to the history of history .
others have more common areas now because of the comp@@ lic@@ ated traffic and less frequent , it can understand .
if you don &apos;t come down , it is nice differ@@ ently .
after the end of the reconstruction works again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no dou@@ b@@ ts .
despite the cr@@ ises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of B 27 construction work on its clients for the largest crisis that experienced its hosts in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s already brut@@ al .
continuously in the name of terrorism has been screwed to the laws .
after the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick@@ er security package .
but what has a drop status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ alition partner of all these words ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the re@@ conc@@ iliation .
all of its proposals are the co@@ alition partner &quot; polit@@ ically mostly , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the launch of its new safety requirements .
they don &apos;t ask them .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also participate me .
as the Minister of Interior , he was located on the results , and in a &quot; achieved con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the co@@ alition .
after the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , after the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before he presented his concl@@ usions on security in the Republic .
but they are now extensive more extensive .
one piece is known , announced , announced that a new security authority is to take care of the cr@@ ack @-@ encrypted communication , is not new .
there is also not the fact that Germany must have several EU regulations regarding flight details and arm@@ ory law .
the rep@@ utation after more video surveillance and staff for security agencies are not sur@@ prising .
on the part starts de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second return for suggest@@ ions , which with the SPD did not make symp@@ ath@@ ing for terr@@ ors under penalty and j@@ ihadi@@ sts with double citi@@ zen@@ ship to the German Pass .
&quot; this will be more difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U man sp@@ ati@@ al .
it still persist@@ s this for mostly and challeng@@ ing nothing , which have no chan@@ ces of the co@@ al@@ ition@@ er partner .
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère too .
this is partially partially in : he plans to dep@@ ortation on dep@@ ortation and more opportunities to dep@@ ortation people before dep@@ ortation .
refugees to be p@@ icked up in the country , they should leave their smart@@ phones and social media account for safety testing .
in Dul@@ ce for ulti@@ mat@@ ely asylum seek@@ s , he wants to make some worse than so - about such , the offen@@ ders , or their papers deli@@ ber@@ ate to wear their identity .
one of them is polit@@ ically and just@@ ified .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and at some points - at the in@@ equ@@ ation of thought of thought - the question : what does it actually do with safety and terror ?
Yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it is not in b@@ illing that the attacks were from Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
in addition , many people attended by the high refugee figures to safety .
and things that occup@@ ies the people , they have not left again in choice of campaign times .
the inner safety is extremely high in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the Att@@ acks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ ass@@ urance is large .
and yes , there are right choice .
Union and SPD are present in the subject of inner safety so increasingly in position .
in the last days there went high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ den@@ y stri@@ fe about the equipment of the police , then via a security sp@@ ol@@ it@@ arian ideas collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , in which the dep@@ ort@@ al also require a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition and a return from double citi@@ zen@@ ship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère ti@@ red here to re@@ vers@@ al pot@@ ent tones .
from a return from the double pass , he is nothing .
we ordered the debate in Germany .
they re@@ open , be not sen@@ sible .
and in a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition he is constitu@@ tional concerns .
whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitu@@ tional and whether it actually is &quot; mostly &quot; for the co@@ alition partner , it must be still show .
it &apos;s inside , what might happen for war .
however , the SPD is trying to adap@@ t to the subject of inner safety .
partner Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only once a c@@ auti@@ ous conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contri@@ butes to increase safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still going through .
despite the diesel systems , the ex@@ tradition request worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs .
in the action reaction , there are a term about an term .
Volkswagen launches the second half in the second half of 2011 .
Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturers can be presented in the previous year , despite the diesel pro@@ positions thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets further .
but in July , the core stamp VW is especially in Western Europe and loaded the total sales , as reported in the D@@ ax recorded company .
the VW in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars sold around 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s figure .
in Western Europe alone , China &apos;s second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market of Germany , the delivery amounts around almost a hex@@ agonal .
Chief Financial Officer Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the we@@ aker numbers from July in particular on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it has been changed in some core markets by &quot; modified economic framework conditions &quot; a purchase back guarantee .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote of the EU can be loaded up from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the USA , where the exhaust aff@@ air in the United States , another Min@@ us also stands on be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , mainly affected Ho@@ us@@ ation of the Lower Saxony @-@ Lower Saxony : after the first seven months , there is only a equivalent of minus 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
in January to July , the Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show a sales spl@@ end@@ us from January to July .
in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered worldwide , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had man@@ ip@@ ulated with a software hosp@@ itals .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million car@@ ri@@ ages for conversion to workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW that the re@@ building of cars has no negative impact .
according to the conversion of vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor output is no det@@ eri@@ oration .
the car rental is based on the conversion to a &quot; guaranteed &quot; guarantee , but not of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was called on Friday in office .
the reason is legal issues .
the &quot; Focus &quot; reported &quot; Focus , &quot; Volkswagen grant his German customers now , but a guarantee for the res@@ ili@@ ent diesel models .
this would be confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the last Monday of the Federal Ministry .
from the Ministry of Culture , it was confirmed that this meeting was there .
&quot; VW has accompl@@ ished the resolutions of my investig@@ ating commission and the KBA accompl@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; de@@ viation of these are not accepted , &quot; explained the Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry of Department .
VW introduced the guarantee that reduces fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion no det@@ eri@@ or@@ ations , and all typ@@ ing relevant specifications have been unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the concept &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not as it was called for corporate information .
with the wide term &quot; guarantee , Volkswagen has the opportunity to re@@ cover the example a half year after the conversion approximately with a engine damage to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
also in customer inter@@ act it be important to avoid that it could do with any other damage to do anything with Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ and@@ al , as it comes as possible as possible , as it was called .
therefore , use VW the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Raiff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund am Teg@@ ern@@ see required by a range of savings as a second Institute in Germany .
banking manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers that par@@ ked about 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily . &quot;
the Federal Association of German Ban@@ ks speaks of a single fall and does not see any signal : normal savings would have to be afraid to pay for their savings penalty . &quot;
Store banks Money over night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , you have to pay a 0.4 per cent penalty .
this fee demands Raiff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits above 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts .
&quot; the first 100.000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost of future 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he be@@ ware since straight time 40 million euros , which could be lifted up from one day on the other , and could not require .
&quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; said the banking manager .
&quot; I can &apos;t lay up for each million euros . &quot;
he now give the cost after the urs@@ ing principle .
the cash simply in the v@@ ault of Raiff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank could be much too dangerous : &quot; I haven &apos;t experienced four over@@ cases , I don &apos;t know the fifth ! &quot; said the ban@@ ker .
most of our customers have understanding and changes to other appe@@ arances .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
Bayern declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the EC@@ B causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
they alone bear , be &quot; business econom@@ ically permanently not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their charges for con@@ tours , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal case for deposits starting at three million euros , the Th@@ ur@@ ing@@ ian People and Raiff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , managing director of the banking House , said : &quot; we do not expect that private customers have to pay attention to deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strongly . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said on the Teg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el , who is a little bit worn by the assets . &quot;
&quot; that can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; if they feed for free money .

Dest@@ ination Sheets : who buy @-@ in records ?
lon@@ ely male middle age love fol@@ ks .
before you go to the comments , to super@@ se@@ ated him under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ am@@ ale age with rough ins@@ ults , these statement runs from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the promising re @-@ revi@@ val of sound boards are not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that gre@@ et the new physical objects , but on Mid@@ life nost@@ alg@@ ia .
those who bought a record recently , are all prec@@ inc@@ ing according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely most common bu@@ sts .
there is also no hor@@ des by Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ars - it has a emot@@ ional meaning : older record drives keep their fe@@ el@@ ings rather for itself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjo@@ ying it to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would follow a news report in television , I would follow the camera while I am sitting in the midst of a c@@ age of S@@ oho , a mod@@ est gr@@ ind , my hands hold and a bit determin@@ ing like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look for us . &quot;
so , let us take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill out the buildings where an independent seller - is available as a hand@@ ful fantastic turn@@ tables .
I would probably ask the cam@@ eram@@ an , the camera for the next part , in which I stand in the immediate vicinity to various men in such shops and try , her age and mixture through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I from S@@ ister Ray ( total number : eight men , three men , middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( total number : eight men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of the meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound boards , as shown above ( he sent me the sn@@ ap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by the house ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he poss@@ esses a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates that he had not work when she was published and once again , he sold young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things that I buy , are out of the late 60 &apos;s , early 70s , who was released when I was 11 or 12 . things I could be too young to buy them . &quot; he says .
he is true that those who buy sheets are more likely to spend some time , and added to a time : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke , and I drink not much too much .
this is my L@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works by S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave to people who are affected by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eb@@ ack and go again to buy their old plates again .
from the discussions that I have led , people have taken away from their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their plates , he says .
this would explain the Boom@@ Boom App@@ endi@@ ces of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emot@@ ional importance of panels ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business as Ph@@ on@@ ica to det@@ ect that platform provides a calm community of equality .
according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some plate fans feel over@@ whel@@ med from the digital world and would like to with@@ draw the stability of tru@@ sted power lines , from objects to watch the happy youth details .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a lean or possession of material owner than a kind of Tro@@ st , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it is so many people so .
it is a simple way to emplo@@ y spiritual .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; fl@@ ap a staff from a record stack .
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record , they didn &apos;t hear them .
the survey took also out that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use them , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no turn@@ tables have .
at this point of news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I have a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova com@@ bat@@ ter .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works at So@@ unds of the Uni@@ verse ( Data number : three men , middle age ) has an &quot; trophy &quot; of the re@@ vi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came first recently here and said , &quot; I have no record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record plate , that I may provide them into the shelf . &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it happens definitely .
more productive @-@ consum@@ ing , less mus@@ i@@ kl@@ astic .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which are very slowly .
F@@ opp , which has devoted to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a supp@@ er audience when I go .
there are pairs around 70 , tourists , make photos , teen@@ agers and women mean age .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relax@@ ed than in the previous shops , the wild with the latest Synth@@ es@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ ually active pop instead of experimental jazz p@@ amp@@ ered from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such a di@@ vers@@ ity to customers .
no one of them looks hot , but nag@@ el@@ psych@@ ic Trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult when one stands for about 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , runs for several minutes in the business and consi@@ ders the vari@@ ation of the sale plates .
it is rather a man@@ ne@@ quin man than a large one .
they don &apos;t des@@ erv@@ es much , therefore the collec@@ ting is no real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or other way to hear , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; they drives with a loved singer .
I don &apos;t know how to tell it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of record lovers have inspired by Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give them a group of young teen@@ ager , I observed a group of young teen@@ ager for a moment for a moment to buy Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter came to buy a Cros@@ ley record players .
on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ e@@ house and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential sheets for an average collection .
nobody can look at - perhaps because they are just fine , some so far above that it is impossible to do them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but in fact that every attrac@@ tion for these items are more money for the industry , and some customers could send in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to weight compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , that is , most of the luxury objects like plates .
even if my research instit@@ utes have also agree that the results of You@@ Go@@ v voices , they leave , at least in height of turn@@ out in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors in the reality , platform and in online shops , in@@ numer@@ able .
these people are thought to work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety by the height of the Ber@@ wick Street and leaves by sheets , during which star@@ ring view of an in@@ sight , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fal@@ se@@ cr@@ ates most of the sh@@ oul@@ ders of medium men .

French court ref@@ using on demol@@ ition of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp .
a French court has denied a tender offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of provis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live , low trav@@ ellers .
if a j@@ uris@@ diction of this week arg@@ um@@ ented the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state was supposed to sell 72 provis@@ or@@ ic shops in the camp &apos;s goods , offering cigar@@ ettes to energy sources , hair@@ dress@@ er services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provis@@ or@@ ic restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais ar@@ gu@@ ed that these places will be low , because they would be paid up a parallel economy , which would not be paid out of the tax and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups divided the court with that the shops and restaurants are important , since the free meals that are supported by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not sufficient foods for growing numbers in the camp .
furthermore they led out that the provis@@ ional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there are no legal basis for the instruction of people who had claimed the 72 provis@@ ional shops , but sp@@ ati@@ al that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are absolutely pro@@ cured . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the gro@@ cery stores , caf@@ es , and restaurants are to play a much bigger role as a people who live in extremely pre@@ cip@@ ation conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas are peaceful meeting between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places who was threatened by the pre@@ trav@@ ellers , was the Jungle Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers , which is well @-@ useful and 200 meals a day , English and French , as well as an ad@@ visory board for hundreds of protection need@@ y , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ .000 people signed the pet@@ ition to maintain the Kids &apos; café .

here comes the En@@ for@@ cement Trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ er must set up the next generation of speed : in different states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units will be tested especially effective .
the fut@@ u@@ rist@@ ic effective En@@ for@@ cement Trailer showing the company Vit@@ ronic in Wiesbaden can be used for example to accid@@ ent@@ ities , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement .
for example , on motorway exit or to san@@ itary bridges , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary bl@@ ender for maint@@ aining the speed limit .
a continuous mobile structure can be too dangerous or cost@@ ly .
the En@@ for@@ cement Trailer is Aut@@ ark : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrup@@ ted measuring operations five days , the case data are transmitted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be identified simultaneously over several tracks in the same time .
variable speed limit and access to time , rides and vehicle class will also be aw@@ ak@@ ening .
in the very nice condition , you can move the trailer to the manufacturer with a trailer hook .
it is not easy to cle@@ ver , it is lowered into the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and the way is ir@@ rig@@ ating safe outside .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system , protect the Bl@@ itzen ahead of v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in different states and meanwhile .
also foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently , France has made 100 pieces , after a order of 150 in last year .
great Britain brought silver in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji told a master class in handling , Side @-@ st@@ epp@@ ing , desc@@ ends , line run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille each .
the defeat was dis@@ missed by the bad Tro@@ st@@ Prize of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth in this day - and they could not be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they could beat out in New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals at the same day could fall back on the final day .
but regardless of what Fi@@ ji had a 15 @-@ man team aff@@ ir@@ ised in this form .
it could probably be a Tro@@ st for GB - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least one of him will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Ch@@ ef@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago she lost and Ryan every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this sli@@ t is we@@ aving , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began mar@@ vel@@ ed and left the attacks G@@ BS from Sp@@ ass .
it was felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when you run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea col@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner of the corner .
with another four minutes of playing time J@@ erry Tu@@ w@@ ai add another attack from the right corner which he emig@@ rated .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly under@@ taken the ball .
a devast@@ ating t@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , a third goal to get a third goal but it has got Fi@@ ji only .
in the seventh minute he l@@ ete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner of a tou@@ ch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ ef ship and there were still more than one minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou pre@@ aching the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so when Fi@@ ji was born when Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while GB still remains .
so it is too .
GB led basic changes to half @-@ time and ended the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was running after a br@@ illi@@ ant intermediate play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started a test for GB , made a tou@@ ch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game ran already in favour of the South Korean sul@@ aner , whose fans sang , fl@@ ags , fl@@ ags and dancing on the tri@@ bü@@ ne .
it was not difficult to ad@@ m@@ ire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ scar@@ fs with another attempt in the last seconds .
the re@@ ef war@@ ned that Fi@@ j@@ is re@@ arm@@ oured and ble@@ ached in the lawn in the grass .
in early days Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated 20 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ final with 20 @-@ 5 , South Africa dr@@ illed South Africa in a cris@@ p match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half after the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work , and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a br@@ illi@@ ant late Tac@@ ster of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ 23 team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by the battle with the cancer of the trainer .
there will be no emot@@ ional gold when playing this games , and what will be hot .
from the first rowing until the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if it was only the ding@@ hy were there , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present in the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row without tax , the first women in the history of the British Sports , which put on such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolutely , however , your 39.@@ ter is un@@ profit@@ able , which is un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two br@@ illi@@ ant athl@@ ete , that refle@@ cts the surface with the eleg@@ ance of schw@@ ars , which not refle@@ cts the type of the Tri@@ umph@@ s .
behind any gold in the rowing is a Bat@@ a@@ illon in con@@ sent hel@@ ping to make the difference , and it was none to keep the difference than the coach that would not know this day when he was diagnosed this day when it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he is cr@@ un@@ chy .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and did so .
if you do not do it , he sp@@ reads everywhere .
it would have been a rather worst situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio has happ@@ iness that he could begin at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could begin to keep the inter@@ ruption on a minimum , if it is under such circumstances .
I needed money , so it had to go better again .
it was a lawyer .
I was at the hospital and ran around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it starts .
the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it a greater greater .
in the in@@ fertil@@ ity of the victory there went their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a nerv@@ ous morning to talk something more than otherwise to talk to work his own fe@@ ars .
St@@ anning , which was in the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in a dep@@ loyment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emot@@ ional wre@@ ck . this is maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is only repeated , how much I mean , and Helen and Helen and also Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would have no man , a massive Dan@@ ke is on him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person to exercise or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no lost in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhyth@@ m that could not play their opp@@ onents .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to complete St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , ab@@ ide in the process . &quot;
it really is important to let not take away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something T@@ olles .
we wanted to get there a fire@@ works today , we wanted to get out a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding with your own TV @-@ ad@@ vent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now , just want to enjoy the moment .
I would not say that my last race was .
this would have much pressure .
in London it took about six months to re@@ alize that I am a Olympi@@ ad winner .
it was all so new for me and I was so st@@ ressed .
it took about four minutes .
that fe@@ els so much better , &quot; said them .

steel - Licht@@ blick for Deutsche St@@ ah@@ lin@@ ux
the crisis explo@@ ited and energy @-@ ten@@ sive German st@@ ressed industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in a milli@@ on@@ ance height .
financial loads , which industry from the industry is threatened by the industry , are from the table .
it ab@@ ide with the liberation of renewable energi@@ es in the inventory of the so @-@ called egg production in the German St@@ ah@@ lin@@ ux industry , Federal Minister of Finance Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutscher Allgemeinen Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Freit@@ as ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could eventually achieve that after two years of negotiations . &quot;
according to the Commission , the European Commission initially planned , the steel manufacturer , the gases from the high @-@ furn@@ ace for electricity generation to ask for its own consumption .
according to the German industry , the industry was above 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry .
Gabriel then said to WA@@ Z , it is now a fundamental stat@@ ute with the EU Commission for talks with the EU @-@ Comm@@ iss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators will be replaced in the steel works , all an EEG change of 20 percent .
but these will not be collected in the manufacturing industry .
the IG Metall sal@@ ute the un@@ ification of Germany with the EU Commission to the O@@ wn History .
this means the status Quo &apos;s status is written largely .
special meaning have the successful an@@ ne@@ aling of Gabriel for the st@@ ah@@ lin@@ ux industry .
&quot; in terms of our campaign &quot; steel , future &quot; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; also at the reform of the emission standards , climate and employment goals , &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ Boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
the steel sector in Europe suff@@ ers from the financial crisis of 2008 under over@@ capacity and a substantial amount .
last year , the situation became more than the world &apos;s largest creation in China in view to the weak@@ ened demand of steel in the global market .
European Manufacturer throw the Chinese steel de@@ compos@@ ing price .
during this spring , the situation has somewhat relax@@ ed .
as a show in@@ fu@@ elling in@@ fu@@ elling oil on import ste@@ els , the economic out@@ look at China has been h@@ opped in China .
un@@ clear , as sustain@@ ably the price rep@@ et@@ ition is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained on Thursday .
last of the prices more stag@@ n@@ ated .
the sector respon@@ ds to difficult situation with other cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp just wanted to concl@@ ude all the works of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ 000 people were employed .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tons of weight about six percent less raw material than in the previous year , as the economic un@@ ification of steel began on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity delivered the second month back to another .
since the beginning of the year , production is around two percent below the year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an increasing order situation in the next months thanks to an improvement in output .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
the S@@ ingen has accompanied her whole life : as young girls she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s studies she finished the subject music , and today he s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; sing me - emot@@ ional and physical , &quot; describes me .
after a test they fe@@ els out , m@@ erry and a total of living , she says .
quite the next door , it is doing something good for her health and spirit .
because S@@ ingen is equal to several per@@ spectives , a great ho@@ bby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ liga .
most senior citizens sing in choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , the sen@@ iors can link social contacts and maintain .
because frequently , social and family structures in age up , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also been given Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp in her choir : &quot; let us speak and organize himself to the other , and one of each other - a choir is a very special shape of the collapse . &quot;
let &apos;s sing in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ eke@@ eping .
because they train sen@@ iors a deep and controlled breathing .
but who calls his l@@ ungs as well as fast as fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to get the sound of voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimum ho@@ bby .
on older people , S@@ ingen was often a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says about the German labor community of the Sen@@ iors organisations .
in the previous generations , the common sin had a much higher job , it belonged to the everyday life , both in the school as well as in the leisure time .
l@@ enz is often common that the singing or hearing of songs in older people we@@ aken many memories , often associated with positive de@@ eds of their youth .
by ly@@ rics and particularly mel@@ o@@ dies , people de@@ priv@@ ed people in a long @-@ time events .
in addition , the head will also demands a special performance , L@@ enz the head .
at the same time , on their own voice and on a pre@@ defined rhyth@@ m , it is able to adjust the other hand @-@ cogn@@ itive challenge - that &apos;s a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , pract@@ ising not only to concentrate on himself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that de@@ parts through the singing in the choir , and H@@ ac@@ eke@@ eping .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em grows through the singing in the choir .
themselves too show : if I &apos;m long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to start with the sing , there is so enough .
if you want to try a new ho@@ bby , it should not hes@@ itate to have little tal@@ ent to have little tal@@ ent .
man does not sing alone - at 50 sing@@ ers who he@@ ars , if there is a tone next ?
in Search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors are various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
s@@ ings someone from the announcement circle on a Sen@@ i@@ or@@ tic Choir , you can easily close .
many cities also offer over@@ views over cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
whoever wants to sing in a church in a church , can turn directly to the church or the church .
many sen@@ iors are also found on the Internet .
who has no access to the internet , the family can ask friends or neigh@@ bo@@ urs around the Internet .
if you want to sing to sing a ch@@ orus , H@@ ac@@ kler should be attached to a choir .
let the soul do@@ eth well , and has something that is true for every age .
cats re@@ act as a boy on Schre@@ ie of young animals
be@@ ologists have examined in Hanover in Hannover , the effect of the cat &apos;s bo@@ died on adult animals .
in her surprise the Mi@@ auen made the males not cold - however , they still held the difference to the females always .
Female cats may recognize the expl@@ oration of cav@@ al@@ ab@@ ys at the Mi@@ auen of the little ones .
they re@@ act by ten percent faster on l@@ ute of cor@@ ps , which have found themselves in large dist@@ ress , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater does not respon@@ d to the Ru@@ le of Kitt@@ ens - but still in the same time .
&quot; obviously are the acou@@ st@@ ical differences between the generation of less and strongly exc@@ ited young for the males either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not by importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is a public author who was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C E@@ vol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in an previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the cookies are distingu@@ ished with the Dr@@ ing@@ ness of their help .
a total of nine adult male and eight co@@ bs were observed from the position of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a small fl@@ ap of little ones that were taken for three minutes from the saus@@ age and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for others , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scri@@ bes of stronger kit@@ chens , which were lifted up .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own off@@ spring , re@@ acted to the Schre@@ ie , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned off faster for the speakers , when this Ru@@ fe played the very exc@@ it@@ ant k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability is possibly born or developed with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male didn &apos;t re@@ act at all , &quot; said the Bible .
in the past , scientists have already examined several times the reactions of women and men on a cot .
some studies showed that women are sensitive to inf@@ ants , as though they were already mot@@ hers or did not reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .

the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; democracy @-@ gu@@ ards &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared the Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for finished .
the sports is - as the whole land - split in the tra@@ ilers and enemies of the earth .
especially fans of the Workers club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as include tradition@@ ally not to the friends of the President .

there are even yourself the fans - no matter whether you be@@ ats heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Titan Poker &apos;s &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be back to Lukas Pod@@ ol@@ ski .
its sport@@ y value set the Cologne in the past season under proof : with 17 f@@ ool and nine tem@@ plates in all compet@@ itions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ er@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 @-@ winning goal .

the cup was the only possibility to win something .
&quot; we made it and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Pod@@ ol@@ ski .
for master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who placed the basis to the 14th title .
this is the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
the AC @-@ Florence was standing under the contract and Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as had only been selected Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .

&quot; the bom@@ bs bear the same manuscript , &quot; said Ar@@ me@@ eg@@ en@@ eral DA@@ NA@@ I Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Freit@@ as early before journalists .
&quot; we go out that it is a co @-@ coordin@@ ated attack . &quot;
it was too early to become possible mot@@ ifs - probably the de@@ eds of Muslim grape varieties .
also Thai media wanted to recogn@@ ise a pattern on the attacks of a sample , which is typical for the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ atist@@ s in the south of the country .
in contrast , the Thai police declared , the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist movement , or with the international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age that limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
however , you may walk out that the bom@@ bs were placed by opp@@ onents of the military jun@@ ta .
in the last days , the authorities have been arrested in the past days in the South of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and the places .
even if it is un@@ clear , the group behind the attacks range .
the police proved its civil servants to strengthen its major government building as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
in Thailand it is still smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they are not mostly against tourists .

this sp@@ ati@@ es to the military impact even in the years next years .
Jun@@ ta b@@ oss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ CHA said the bom@@ bs were an attempt to prevent ch@@ aos in the direction of stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .

in the conflict , more than 6500 people were killed .
one year ago there were also killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u Sh@@ pu@@ rely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ ody stop of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is the Vis@@ or of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection .
after several occas@@ ions , the Constitutional Court ren@@ dered the group under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; Acc@@ ept@@ ance points for companies against the Frei@@ heit@@ ische Democratic Commission , &quot; said the head of Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin .

therefore , we observe the movement too .
the &quot; identity of &quot; identity is a group of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it sp@@ ends against &quot; Mul@@ tics , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity through over@@ sight . &quot;
Constitutional Complaints in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Th@@ ur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ ki said , his authority have voted in the decision , close to the country &apos;s decision .

with a view to the significant increase of legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new terrorism .
but we &apos;ve found it in recent years that it can be leg@@ or@@ ously err@@ or@@ ously .
there were the &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be able to form a further leg@@ itim@@ ate group@@ ings or small groups , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee @-@ sh@@ ei@@ me or attack from other leg@@ itim@@ ate mot@@ ives .
however , a German or Europe @-@ wide control of legal err@@ or@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the previous groups were created at regional level or social network .
in fact , Ma@@ ate found that many re@@ efs to the account of people went missing in the right scene in the right scene .
this is the exc@@ essi@@ bility .
many of the crime susp@@ ected at Att@@ emp@@ t for asylum procedures , previously not as cri@@ min@@ er , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or p@@ endants of the right scene .

the fees per cubic meters of water will be available from October 1st , 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ er 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lind@@ enberg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously € 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro .
in the plant in Az@@ endorf , the cancellation fee will then increase if appropriate enh@@ ancement measures necessary .
according to one exc@@ essi@@ v@@ ely lim@@ estone , the Ab@@ aqu@@ atic price is in Az@@ endorf , then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metres .
like may@@ or Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) , was determined by the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ ory and Kul@@ mb@@ ach revealed that for these waste water plants was dis@@ cover@@ ies .
the market Kas@@ endorf was ob@@ li@@ ged to operate due to legal bas@@ ics , to operate their facilities .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens , as well as the industrial and industrial gear@@ boxes from world ministers , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lind@@ enberg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg are de@@ eper de@@ eper into the money bag .
prices are between 48 and 67 percent .
as an administrative manager Herbert Schmidt on the panel , there was a re@@ produc@@ ulation of the fees for waste water installations in the market policy .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ weight and sub@@ dis@@ cover@@ ies from the previous Kal@@ cul@@ ation period are expected .
in all three waste water installations , Schmidt therefore founded the gra@@ de@@ water installations by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water , which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low cost of basis , for example , expenses for necessary rep@@ airs of several thousand euros is extremely positive .
in addition , the waste water@@ proof@@ ing occur in all three plants .
in all three systems , it has not most likely to be in a significant extent because of their age@@ ing and repair applications in all three systems .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the World Health , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lind@@ enberg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt op@@ ted that in the se@@ wer@@ age plant Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be ex@@ changed because of a poll@@ ut@@ ants .
during the construction of the world , almost 20 years old convey@@ ors had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the reason and at the pond ran@@ ge@@ ance L@@ opp after almost 20 years of operation in the pond water and had to be installed an additional ventilation possibility to keep the water legal regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses came into account for this extraordinary advis@@ or and maintenance costs which are to be considered in the new Kal@@ cul@@ ation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 still clearly below the current level .
stone houses made clearly that in the small waste water fall into the three plants for operation and maintenance . &quot;
in addition , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs were spar@@ ed in the last 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain pre@@ domin@@ ant after view of stone houses in the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal setting up this facilities , because it is possible to do def@@ iz@@ it@@ arian facilities .

with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables some 150 million daily Us@@ ers to change the reality and to play with identity of such a way , and they cross the ab@@ sur@@ de border .

when it killed this week of some Us@@ ers a filter , the slaugh@@ ter , false teeth and dark bro@@ ets , there were some crit@@ ics a rac@@ ial car@@ ic@@ ons of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they asked whether these re@@ vers@@ ed contro@@ versi@@ es on a wider problem that the company has di@@ vers@@ ität with di@@ vers@@ ität .
the news and the in@@ dig@@ nation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after Snap@@ chat that it would have de@@ activated this feature .

Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural poles .
the American culture seems to be involved in a endless di@@ vers@@ ity and integration process , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment that we keep all in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are involved in the things , di@@ vers@@ er than their older counter@@ players - could rather be expected to exp@@ ecting sen@@ siv@@ ity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult that such things was un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided that she works as a product management and engineering in for medium , her Snap@@ chat account required others to do so others to do the same .

others divide their mind , a compl@@ aint , which is the Snap@@ chat .
the company released no figures for di@@ vers@@ ität of his workforce and shows its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it is Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has recently been responsible for a number of personnel and foc@@ uses on internal integration exercises and foc@@ uses on internal integration process .

military leadership ( IS@@ IS secret service information , represents Committee of the Congress @-@ Congress
military members of the United States Central Command changed further information to sign an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it is the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of Repub@@ lics Committee , Intelligence Committee and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ful Committee , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence Service in an@@ alyst@@ s that reported to change its ass@@ ess@@ ments in the war against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; telec@@ omm@@ unications information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander in fact that regularly had a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism , and were typical positive as analy@@ tics of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article on the report .
&quot; what happened to the Cent@@ Com , is in@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , when poor analy@@ tics will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , firm .
ex@@ ecu@@ tives will be reached in Cent@@ Com to the top tip of the organization .
the ten pages report shows a detailed issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct advis@@ ories to change the government during Obama administration , the reports shows how an@@ alyst@@ s saw the pressure of their ancest@@ ry , a optim@@ istic image of the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command releases were dep@@ artments , opinions and statements before the Congress clearly correspon@@ d to the facts , &quot; the report was determined .
for example , a Cent@@ Com rel@@ ent publicly known that a military re@@ conqu@@ est Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second biggest city of Iraq remains under the control of Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investig@@ ations , it is clear . &quot; told Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , repub@@ lican Congress of Kansas , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the mid @-@ year 2015 , the points of the Central Command was changed to record the danger by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the task force in life after them was emphas@@ ized that an@@ alyst@@ s conc@@ ern concerns about the Islamic State of the Islamic State .
the report published by more detailed findings will be completed during investig@@ ations .
in addition , Cent@@ Com reports are further investig@@ ations by the Secretary of Defense Ministry .
the news member of the telec@@ omm@@ enst@@ ek@@ om@@ it@@ tees announced its own in@@ sights that sur@@ faced with some of the concl@@ usions of the repub@@ lican Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com had an extremely limited trial for the creation of retro@@ fitted dem@@ ocr@@ ats in the commission@@ er , member of the representative office Adam B. ship , known in a statement .
this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; del@@ ayed the release of retro@@ fitted reports , &quot; the mor@@ al under an@@ alyst@@ s and &quot; gave no more space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats said to have no evidence on a row of the White House at the Cent@@ Com an@@ alyst@@ s on a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by an investig@@ ations by General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were recorded by Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st .
Lt@@ . C@@ md@@ r Patrick Evans , a press spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , was issued in a statement that the Ministry of Defense will not be comment of the Congress , while the investig@@ ations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor will be still in the g@@ ange .
but he also said that &quot; experts have sometimes consist@@ ently passed through the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence is a contro@@ versi@@ al discussion of this important topics of the National Defense . &quot;
the investig@@ ations have the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that has been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the debt of the last year have the question sub@@ jected to President Obama to the Central Command for hon@@ est@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the critic@@ ism of the secret state of hearing over the Islamic state will remember the Islamic state of more than ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory W.

the US win four match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match against India , that the women had won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a mem@@ orable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever did .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t hear the people who re@@ tain their gates in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are even@@ ings in their group with the British in the first place , which remains unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will take place on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide between the first and second place within the group of six teams .
the first placed will take a little bit longer from the way to go the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have trig@@ gered a sur@@ prising bu@@ bel , four years after them land@@ ed in the last of 12 places in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years ago ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualif@@ y for the c@@ aster .
then the year 2012 , in which they went out for her and their team all went .
in subsequent year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn these things to better .
&quot; a cultural changes , an mental change and physical transition , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work in London that we now have .
we can ri@@ p the rud@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened up in the first half of the game with a feedback from the Middle East .
India had gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed sur@@ pris@@ ingly tough and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game took into their hands .
she led a spr@@ int with the flat Ball over the left eye , then moved into the middle and lu@@ red the ball in the goal to make the American a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Melissa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ u@@ tout was the first of the tournament for the ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which had to date a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will be ti@@ ed by the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the tramp@@ ol@@ ines of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wher@@ ever you are too , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro is constantly stable and in@@ adequate , a sh@@ aving seasons between the competition and stre@@ aks .
it is , as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is intended for sw@@ imm@@ ers to sw@@ imm@@ ers to sw@@ imm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes .
you can not use the television set to read a newspaper or when talking about your neigh@@ bo@@ urs in the Wa@@ es@@ hop , without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the disp@@ ute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and Ch@@ ad le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman of white with dimples , could have been sent out of these known names to be sent to Prime Time , by spon@@ s@@ ors and well @-@ feeling TV advertising , if it would be a sw@@ immer , Turner or even fe@@ eder .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , f@@ ights in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not widely recognised : aerial Views , Archery , Badmin@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest sw@@ im and may rule it long .
but if I don &apos;t want to do arg@@ uments for my particular song , then let me leave the attention to the dis@@ cre@@ ted charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines had already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had his debut , it was the last 16 years so bad that many who had asked , did not know that it is at all at all .
it could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ anz .
although the USA sent to the competition , it never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and won a athl@@ ete until 2012 , who had made it up to the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians are t@@ end to share prices for men and Chinese and Canadian women to share the women .
Dong Bell from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada are def@@ end their gold medal from London .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has a certain outside wounded , partly because it sounds for the un@@ locked ear to a c@@ low@@ ns@@ schule as those of the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am no expert , but only one experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous quot@@ ations of his never to don@@ ate bu@@ ffer@@ ed - but also the Gra@@ zie of Turn@@ over and diving , the two sports that combines it essenti@@ ally .
the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish original tramp@@ oline , meaning as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging vic@@ tori@@ ous on a gig@@ antic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have to fall a number of falling movements ( turning , yeast and sal@@ tos ) before it lan@@ den at the feet .
they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ graph according to design , difficulty level and &quot; flying time . &quot;
twenty @-@ eight athletes of 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are to compete in Rio each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to continue straight ahead to gold , faster , on the top and dr@@ on , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes and back at the bottom , and down on the playground .
they &apos;re not only the finishing line , or the starting line , but in the TV transmission also another cave : the world or the Olympi@@ arc@@ tica .
the targeted stre@@ ches is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red ns@@ worth , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a spect@@ ators .
but it &apos;s also that , what I myself to watch this games as a little ti@@ reless .
this tramp@@ oline offers a re@@ treat .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a reverse movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ inc@@ t , se@@ em@@ ingly heav@@ ier like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , then down to bottom , then eff@@ ort@@ less@@ ly again after the top .
even here is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no v@@ ault into the Fer@@ ne , only the dreams , elegant up@@ lift of time and grav@@ ity .
it &apos;s like Zen in the competition at the Olympic Games .
the qualification and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon , stre@@ aming by 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will run the ends as a part of a afternoon of 2 days at 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who is likely to see in the general tumor .
if the consci@@ ousness can only be reached by the att@@ acking and the objectives of male athl@@ ete , according to The Wall Street Journal in front of the The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expected his return to air .
&quot; a generation of protest@@ ants &quot; in Ethiop@@ ia , Long A allies of the United States
violent protest in Ethiop@@ ia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiop@@ ia , cast down on certain resistance of the government .
witnesses say that only Protest@@ ant protest@@ ers were killed during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiop@@ ia just merg@@ ed ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid state of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months of prot@@ ests against the government , the country and spread out more areas .
last week stor@@ med thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer was in@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful .
witnesses stated that police officers were killed and killed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , more about the prot@@ ests , which are probably from the last or early this year , show how security m@@ ute young people with bul@@ ls , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the chief of the UN authority for Human Rights is now demanded an in@@ coming study .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country and going to be even more difficult , &quot; told Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiop@@ ia is the most pop@@ ulated country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be the west .
American military and secret services work closely together with Ethiop@@ ia in order to combat terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ia Spain expanded in considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ st@@ ically improved - there is a new p@@ ests in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally calm , safe and clean .
even if Ethiop@@ ia was anything like a model for democracy - human rights organisations ongoing the suppression by the government - the opposition was restricted to silence , whereby dis@@ sidents were effective to silence .
many were sent into exile or into prison , or killed in the desert of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; if you are subject , and these have no other options except for Protest@@ ant , it breaks out of , &quot; said Star@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in Central Ethiop@@ ia .
the entire youth are protest@@ ing .
a generation of Protest@@ ant .
there are numerous certificates to cover everything from soil making up to dig@@ n@@ ity in terms of power of the govern@@ ing co@@ alition .
after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ra@@ dic@@ ating party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time the vol@@ t@@ ages go along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea , a battle for this z@@ ack@@ le , contro@@ versi@@ al line in June of hundreds of life .
analy@@ st , that separ@@ at@@ ist like the Oro@@ mo @-@ liberation front or the National Liberation front of the Og@@ ades , which have been forced in recent years more or less , the tur@@ bul@@ ence could be armed and armed could be armed .
several factors explain why fe@@ el@@ ings of the wit@@ n@@ ity after years of life in front of the surface is now explo@@ de .
the first seems to harm@@ less : smart@@ phones .
only in the last few years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communic@@ ate through the social media , as cheap smart phones were more frequently more frequently and improved the Internet services .
even if the government shut up the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at prot@@ ests , many people can still communic@@ ate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , who hide them .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were gathered as prot@@ ests .
the second factor is that there is more soli@@ dar@@ ity between Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , who gives the two biggest eth@@ ics in Ethiop@@ ia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since Egyptian pro@@ sp@@ ering the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiop@@ ia , mainly Christian High countries , in politics and economy , while they are explo@@ ited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and in flat areas .
but also that changes .
&quot; we are going to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos .
the largest prot@@ ests found in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiop@@ ia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and the military , in the secret services , and the policy domin@@ ant .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ ith .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leaders , was up to his death on an un@@ mist@@ aken disease in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ia .
he was considered tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think around corners .
an@@ alyst@@ s say that he was especially ob@@ li@@ ged to perc@@ ei@@ ve Early sign of un@@ happ@@ iness and Special Repres@@ entative to work opp@@ onents and they are harm@@ ful .
&quot; the current regime is missing at this basic cre@@ ase , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiop@@ ia of new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen as a relatively un@@ expected reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the tig@@ ray region of North Ethiop@@ ia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
analy@@ tics say that he does not have confidence of the tiger controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood shed .
the last time that Ethiop@@ ia had lived on such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections , appar@@ ently , according to the data of analy@@ tics , appar@@ ently , was ob@@ li@@ ged by the government , and subsequently st@@ olen .
during the following Ra@@ zz@@ ies , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if there were less than in the last months , and this time of un@@ rest is relatively fast .
development experts in Ethiop@@ ia leaders of its vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as well as the new p@@ ecu@@ tives , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in the poverty control .
but obviously , this did not affect the intensive ab@@ normal@@ ization of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , the protest@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , of Tig@@ ray guided stores and hat@@ red against the tig@@ ray is still exercis@@ ed in the social media .
analy@@ st say that the prot@@ ests of the USA and other Western allies bring to a wide position .
the American government used Ethiop@@ ia as the basis for mer@@ its flights about the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , even if she recently closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support the democracy , he will not want to break his allies in an already vol@@ atile area .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin wall hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explained his asser@@ tion , Obama had been founded &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y giving his campaign that his several times re@@ claimed , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terror group of Islamic State .
this clar@@ ification of the new issues of the presidential candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans data of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he was able to communic@@ ate it in the situation is clear and under@@ stand@@ able to communic@@ ate with the American public .
it also brings his fellow servants to take an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the actual position to say that he could not have been common .
after he had made the appro@@ aching at a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was transferred to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and in@@ sist@@ ed in interviews on Thursday , he really created that he could not be not@@ ified by President and Mrs. Clinton have created IS@@ IS .
but in a early morning of Twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was just aw@@ esome .
the Twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous Day , at which Mr. Tr@@ ump in a series of interviews said , he meant the exc@@ use .
when the conservative daily Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to destroy the testimony , that Mr. Obama wants him to destroy the repub@@ lican Pre@@ sidential candidate .
the last storm of critic@@ ism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to len@@ ess the focus of his campaign because of an accident on economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton thought on the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this topic .
on Twitter , he told that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would lead to higher taxes that he could have found their speech at bor@@ ing time .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has brought Sar@@ kas@@ mus already in his defense .
at the end of July , he moved with strong cr@@ iti@@ que to himself when he thought to the Rus@@ sians . however , he thought to the Rus@@ sians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows for Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the language limits in politics , and then returned to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test like certain messages from his fans , as they come to come , and then deleted , &quot; according to what the reaction will fall . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts that observed the language of both candidates .
but I also , he is cle@@ ver enough to keep his statement enough , so that it can be interpre@@ ted on different kind and way .
instead of the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken an yet another sound because its circulation values are continued .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with a big jump in the federal states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump was trying to def@@ end himself for his prov@@ oc@@ ators , he accused his cr@@ itic often to understand his testim@@ on@@ ies , or his hum@@ or false .
but while he was strengthened in the focus of the attention in the last months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze have brought his loy@@ al comp@@ ute into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ oc@@ ant may also be like prov@@ oc@@ ant .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former may@@ or of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps , gave great effort to def@@ end the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; I think what he says , leg@@ itim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani thus asked to the judge of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had been created by the Islamic State .
it is true that Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ ing , completely wrong and therefore , because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ instre@@ am @-@ Repub@@ lic@@ ans trying to argue that the government minist@@ ered to Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton used to spread it IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and casting them in front of each of his words , and vo@@ ke him to fight against him .
he re@@ warded &quot; poor , young &quot; TV experts , who try him to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t know it ! &quot;
some of the dem@@ ocr@@ ats over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as a further evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the pre@@ sidency .
once upon the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back on the market .
Ver@@ b Cafe was a bad@@ ly café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay a Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices dating from his Bedford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front starts .

the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ o wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is Change , but I can still believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and the b is now a bub@@ bles . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also new thing .
a re@@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and acc@@ epts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
with Cisco Rodri@@ guez , the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ es .
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when a customer , an client offered to provide money for a new service , he was exc@@ ited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , stayed for .
Ver@@ b uses the same district but@@ or for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ ress@@ age machinery model .
it even uses the same lamps of the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he was also experim@@ ent .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu tab , sand@@ wi@@ ches stand with bacon and cheese , and there are gar@@ ni@@ es like cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ous onions .
there are nature iss@@ ors .
the café served no beer more , but there is fresh juice .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ opping power to old chief customers .
&quot; many old customers have been p@@ ushed by Willi@@ am@@ sburg prices , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira had a client .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after the Green@@ point it was moved to Green@@ point , it would take the way to itself .
after the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee , she said .
&quot; I was clear that it was at the coffee and the culture in Ver@@ b , she told me . &quot;
now drink coffee , even if they had been running on this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee , a bl@@ ended Ch@@ ai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another durable and true customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there in front of the work and ordered un@@ inten@@ tionally ever since .
&quot; I came to seven , every day as a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experim@@ ent and put new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no har@@ p over them , that the soap has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie on , a special soap for use with the cold @-@ roasted coffee of the caf@@ es as ingre@@ dient .
&quot; I think , we will go on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated into Polish public and Rodri@@ guez said that he will present it soon , so that his new neigh@@ bo@@ urs will feel forward .
the location also has more advantages .
a local saf@@ er loc@@ ally wants to fill the cold roasted coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café on an al@@ leg@@ ory building expanded .
for many customers , a new cal@@ f to get their old fav@@ or@@ ites .

&quot; I had to be sm@@ ell , he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , following his asc@@ en@@ sion to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano took his lunch at the Oval Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen at Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water pic@@ tured soup .
his menu on this day was a somewhat mod@@ est : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potato and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was a cul@@ t cul@@ inary soli@@ dar@@ ity with the people , &quot; Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man said . &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and are both food hist@@ orian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; made by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Z@@ iegel@@ man tells about the life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the Food Per@@ spective .
their latest cooperation , &quot; an an@@ permanent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of American kitchen during the Great Dep@@ ression .

as the rep@@ orter of dul@@ ging , found this the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of great de@@ pression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ bread , liver lo@@ af and bean bread .
they were made from a Zut@@ ph@@ ate and a somewhat cheap which access the ingre@@ dient .
imagine how many pe@@ an@@ uts have to eat that they serve them as d@@ inners .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; it must be put in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
in the years ago the great de@@ pression was the table in a American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male military workers and it was served fresh fried past@@ or for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans that they sent to the hung@@ arian food during the first World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; dra@@ ws the ways to its land , with which the country had to be moved , no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ en@@ land .
&quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central , enc@@ om@@ ed theme , &quot; the Co@@ e , why he and his wife would like to write about it .
the new budget was the new budget : myst@@ eri@@ ous food , such as lo@@ aves and cass@@ er@@ ollen were re @-@ nutr@@ itious than the wonderful type of cass@@ er@@ olls as a mir@@ ac@@ ulous way , the bri@@ cks de@@ bri@@ cks , because Kö@@ che un@@ appet@@ ite ingredients could hide under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry saus@@ age .
meat , which was the centre of the American kitchen , was used to be a rare luxury .
aut@@ onomous compos@@ itions have been arranged because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction was prec@@ eded to taste or even healthy kitchen@@ ware .
during her re@@ cher@@ che for the book , which also includes recipes , we prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , re@@ fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was no addition to the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions fit not one another .
it was typical for many of the laundry recipes .
as never before or since then , the household of households , among them Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the hab@@ its of the country of the country .
by winning recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encour@@ aged women to become &quot; households of ste@@ els like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with carrots in delicious meals .

&quot; he lik@@ ed continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a fast @-@ gold dining room and contributed a smo@@ king .
he was a glori@@ ous real@@ m .
President Roosevelt would have been committed to the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have been asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate with his stomach .
as described in the book , the mon@@ sters of a hous@@ ekeeper with no interest in taste of taste by Ms. Roosevelt , that the White House brought the bor@@ ing meal in Washington but also one of the most contro@@ versi@@ al dinner . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great de@@ pression , with eating , was rejected when the country came back on the legs .
the mem@@ orial is based on our continued focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man said , as well as Science on food was applied .

Greenland : the oldest te@@ br@@ ine is almost 400 years old
rare view .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ia usually come only in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return an investigation into the ocean vessel of S@@ anna &apos;s research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is right with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie will only get up with 150 years of age .
marked by the Greenland expedition at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he gets on average 1.@@ 220 meters .
only if it goes on , the five @-@ metre animal acceler@@ ates at s@@ x 2.6 km / h - and is with this top speed and as fast as a Rob@@ be .
but this of lon@@ el@@ iness se@@ ated lifestyle seems to be a spon@@ sor@@ ter for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of a Greenland expedition , which could be 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; published Alexander Sch@@ olar@@ ship of Max Planck Institute for dem@@ ographic research in Rostock , this life span that means a record record .
indeed , the E@@ vol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist already susp@@ ect that Greenland is smo@@ ked .
only lack the evidence .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , they live especially in the polar sea before the thin popul@@ ations of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they prefer the water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , immer@@ se them in the surface usually only in winter .
researchers have to know as little as the lifestyle of the Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
her time @-@ up@@ id emp@@ ire them when they took six animals in front of S@@ val@@ b@@ ard six animals with a transmitter .
they still make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another loved the pine bone of a young ice bears .
possibly it sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ me@@ eres and looking for Ka@@ da@@ ver that were out of higher water layers of down@@ ward .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fisher@@ men between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sp@@ its@@ bergen as a top of the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the largest 502 centi@@ meter measured .
to determine the age of animals , analy@@ ze them with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens core of the shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eyel@@ ids have already been replaced before the birth of Ha@@ ie , which contained in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in lens core .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear power dis@@ missed major amounts of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
in contrast with 220 centi@@ metres , the third figure contained a low sur@@ plus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear phase , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ im had a normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts due to cos@@ mic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , Carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 493 centi@@ metre @-@ long Grön@@ land@@ hai was an old age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centi@@ meters could even be 392 years old .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai females only got off@@ spring then when they are longer than four metres , was known .
now , researchers were able to conc@@ ord@@ ly the researchers at an age .
since one of the animals came with 392 centi@@ metres probably on the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature and his age with 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the digest@@ ion was ob@@ vious at least one half centuries .
the world is likely to be a world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
that such meth@@ od@@ al@@ eme live especially in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
the old record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , whose neck was caught up a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon gun , was captured on Alaska .
through the low temperatures , often the organ@@ ism of the living animals live in as@@ par@@ agr@@ ams .
so you are later - and Al@@ tern s@@ lower .
to keep cool in cold water , the animals are often largely great .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through the animal warm@@ th .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous , and should be focused on it , as possible , as possible , as many off@@ spring , the E@@ vol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist .
a very big animal should aim to invest his resources in a long life .

in addition to the Seine , the rented commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the Main .

Jewish Regisseur torn Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix after &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; was removed - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots have had a media lift , after it had betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , no Israeli pre@@ fix since it had requested Arabic guests to be requested by a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , writer of the Hol@@ oc@@ aust@@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his trou@@ bles at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , with an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann attemp@@ ted to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
what is in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of Germany &apos;s capital , is possible that Israel has elim@@ inated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel over a private call centre .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel design .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel said that the measure is a true decision of the Kemp@@ inski hotels in the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , is still standing in the director yet again .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they demanded that the pre@@ fix will be deleted , &quot; the employee was c@@ ited by Lanz@@ mann .
the Israeli am@@ bassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ der @-@ Handels@@ man named this one &quot; big shame , &quot; reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were taken from this event and perfectly season@@ ed .
this is really very conf@@ id@@ ent .
the fact that this is in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , it is even a larger shame .
the need is not the explanation .
we expect the hotel &quot; the right concl@@ usions , &quot; said the winner .
the incid@@ ent dissolved a quite big res@@ on@@ ance in the internet , with which the people caught a sc@@ and@@ al .
some enter@@ tain@@ ing the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had been granted the alleged collection of an Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; I told you , and called it in another contribution , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the no@@ de Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue .
the hotel pointed out fast all the inno@@ cent of himself , and called the incid@@ ent of a &quot; ver@@ ification &quot; and &quot; ent@@ ra@@ yed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , the Mir@@ ror .
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not increase in the list of countries , &quot; the Southern German newspaper c@@ ited a spokes@@ person of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels .
it adds added that the country code is added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increased to 71 % - RT Business
according to Russian am@@ bassador , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an in the year comparison to 7@@ 0,9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew shar@@ ply in the country , divided the am@@ bassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to make access to the market .
of course , another trading is one of the largest pri@@ orities of the bil@@ ateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he knew that the trading rate between Russia and Iran have increased by 7@@ 0,9 percent in the first five months of 2016 , compared with the same period in 2015 and $ 856 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran , and tot@@ alled $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trading up@@ swing has been achieved through deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the am@@ bassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of I@@ ran@@ ian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign journalists were about 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily on travel route to I@@ ran@@ ian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that affects the tourism in Russia .
one might say that the record is broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
at the same time there are only relatively few Rus@@ sians in Iran , something , from which the am@@ bassador is hop@@ ing that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend the visit to the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d we recommend the mon@@ uments of the old Per@@ sian civ@@ il@@ ization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms Home , Brit@@ on Gold for professional cycling
Scott@@ land Call@@ um Sk@@ inner hat@@ ched last night in the team of men in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio at the Ru@@ le , as the British team ended the title of London in 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , who had made his land@@ lord Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and he made a legend when he stor@@ med home a victory of favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cked victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
after returning the Tri@@ ck , after it was only a mod@@ est sixth place in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the back@@ drop of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did just doing this time as a Hin@@ ds .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man , when they stayed when they saw the potential in the sc@@ orn , which now un@@ fol@@ ds now .
Hin@@ ders , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y vic@@ tori@@ ous - and Sk@@ inner in the qualification round a Olympics , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ onds vic@@ tori@@ ous the New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ eling with gold .
Hin@@ ds came back after its turn , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and sk@@ inner .
a strategic change made a large part of transformation , with the execution in a higher speed to allow him to slow down and secure it and mainly Sk@@ inner to allow a temp@@ o .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert from his position and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ds to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a good comparison of comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we are set up the world champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just un@@ belie@@ vable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the Triumph of 2012 , on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys showed that he fell off after a weak start to the track .
he moved this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
in such an over@@ sight victory there was no problem this time .
one said , &quot; It fe@@ els with the whole GB fl@@ ags on the Tri@@ bü@@ ne as London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we are so bad with so many wor@@ th@@ ers so bad that it was incredi@@ bly incredi@@ bly to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that won seven of 10 titles in Beijing as well as in London .
if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys it is in the area of real@@ ise that he repeated a win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - which is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , which was born on March 23 , also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ( born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the be@@ ast of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will start over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
it can win it with his colleagues .
it fe@@ els anything to win alone .
Hin@@ der said : &quot; if he won two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the Knight . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts in the day , but there was another good news for England .
Sir Brad@@ ly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified to the fastest performance in four four @-@ four Kilomet@@ ers .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 942 at the destination .
the world record , won in London in 2012 at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , with the w@@ ig@@ gins with safety in the focus .
he was yesterday with regard to the qualification before the qualification , when they were function@@ ing to measure his body size .
in the appropriate competition , the tomorrow is continued and finished , Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Arch@@ i@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team leaves his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and fet@@ ch a sch@@ ar to med@@ y .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London were shut down the expectations for Rio .
it play@@ es dr@@ ama in the background , as the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , am@@ id@@ st of sex and mo@@ bb@@ ing@@ ing , as well as the retirement as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pen@@ dl@@ eton .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rome , it looks like this , the legendary rep@@ utation of G@@ BS , which has reached its cli@@ max at the perfect moment .
future of processed cheese in Portland due to boost the energy contract in frag@@ ile
the future of aluminum mel@@ ts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - stand on the game , since the plant oper@@ ators will be canc@@ el the energy agreement , and therefore included all the delivery contracts , as the ship@@ ment energy companies shared .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further sub@@ si@@ dies to the plant .
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is set up in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Alco@@ a in Portland stand on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs , direct and indirect damages could be at a closing time .
in addition , it could be domin@@ ant to Domin@@ o@@ Eff@@ ects , since the processed cheese is around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 , Alco@@ a joined Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , led the last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melting of Alco@@ a in Portland loses money and ris@@ k@@ izes a closing time .
this step is followed by the years of spectac@@ ul@@ ations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and last due to the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which was delivered in Lat@@ robe Valley with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley that three other owners will be announced .
the facility is located in the majority owned by a joint venture of Alco@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L lies that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the processed cheese , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L suggested that the tre@@ ati@@ es called &quot; he@@ dging transactions &quot; will be able to enter into effect from November 2016 .
the contracts concluded a 12 month cancellation period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L aims to contri@@ bute to the contracts in the business year 17 , &quot; said the power supplier .
all potential imp@@ acts on AG@@ L from the F@@ Y 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong dates for wholesale accounts prices .
in its end , AG@@ L declared that the tre@@ ati@@ es of contracts had already written in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
Alco@@ a said that the decision to book the tre@@ ati@@ es , the &quot; ability Alco@@ as ... to ensure the melting or the power supply to the processed cheese . &quot;
the U.S. company said that there has been a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into effect from November this year , even if there is still a declaration , why it is not a declaration of the contract .
analy@@ tics due to the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of Portland processed cheese in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ tics at the beginning of the week , Head of Oper@@ ations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume around 600 Megawatt and Tom@@ ago around 900 MW each year .
if both plants should dis@@ appear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as electricity he would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Re@@ ality TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Cl@@ ans K@@ ris is on the cover of the prestigious September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the market leader of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and on the Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people who I love , brought me from the view of this co@@ vers to the W@@ einer , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unve@@ iling of the co@@ vers per@@ sec@@ uted a bi@@ z@@ arre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an adventure and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they for@@ got the cover of their sister , and that ends with a classic W@@ ending : they all have a surprise art@@ y .
this represents the kl@@ isch@@ ee@@ pers of a child season ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You da@@ wn that we would have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the amb@@ ition of a character set on a slot at 8 am ) , but K@@ ris had to participate her other girls some@@ how in this Pub@@ licity .
with regard to the September issue of Vog@@ ue has started a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim mag to see what the Vog@@ ue Cover is defeated ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a League for himself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ edition is for Vog@@ ue , most of the most popular edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that res@@ em@@ bles a photo @-@ format as a fashion magazine , attrac@@ ts the issue a large number of advertising items ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were published by the 8@@ 32 pages of the woods 615 pages advertising ) .
the re@@ velation of his Cover@@ stars is expected that in the last two years pictures of the journal still passed before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , com@@ prise Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in the last few years clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the mod@@ elling &quot; as &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ ot@@ am@@ bassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the glory .
but even at the low chance that Ms. J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; break@@ through model &quot; of its generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company .
this celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people related or Re@@ ality Stars or youth from today , know how to be a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if all things are applicable to J@@ enner ) .
they are really tal@@ ented women that sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared in the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade , one of the most successful years of their career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not really like any success .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always a bit wor@@ th@@ ful place in the fashion world .
in June , the Uni@@ versi@@ al Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called &quot; the Mist@@ pieces of the eye . &quot;
these fe@@ el@@ ings bo@@ iled again , when the message came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut , it seems to go to the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is in the true sens@@ es of the Word a Super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your prim@@ ing E@@ ste@@ e l@@ der .
you and all their sisters also sell your pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
you are sold by her sand@@ ing Pictures of C@@ ind@@ y CRA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the journal LOVE .
and in their leisure time they see in reality TV . probably only to see her sister Ko@@ ur@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centres are 16@@ 0,000 people every year .
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s help must be rejected by the municipal centres annually , while the industry has already been sum@@ mar@@ ized on the effects of another means transactions carried out on over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - most of older people , immig@@ rants , victims of violent workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and res@@ em@@ bles .
legal services of the church , which are already superior to super@@ fic@@ ally , make ready for another cuts .
since June next year , these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of its federal agents .
the Director of the municipality of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal counc@@ ill@@ ers revealed that thousands of people were rejected by people each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a withdraw@@ al of the Federal Government will only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal centres are chronic fin@@ anced , which means that thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
people who leave the violent relation@@ ships , people with count@@ less and ex@@ press@@ ant debt , families who have been dis@@ missed by divi@@ der , workers who have problems leg@@ ally leg@@ ally and this survey showed that they may not require the help you need .
in June 2017 , the Federal Government will be short@@ ened by 30 percent , which means that thousands of aid people from Que@@ ens@@ land must be forced to just@@ ify their legal problems with their legal problems .
we call for the Federal Minister and Federal Minister of Finance , as well as the Sen@@ ator of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to prevent this medium @-@ short@@ est , so the people who need it may need to problems with legal problems .
last year , the regional government had their add@@ it@@ ment to raise funds to national average on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the municipal centres and their customer community as well as that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey ahead of the elections : SPD and CD@@ U
in the elections to Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern ( September 4th ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , substantial losses for the SPD and CD@@ U will be significant .
this was representative of the Outlook research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Picture &quot; -@@ Newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government co@@ alition could continue to rule almost any further , this is not possible according to conversion values in Berlin .
in both countries , the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good chan@@ ces to introduce the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern , the SPD fell from 35,@@ 6 percent before five years ago .
according to the survey , the party starts just under the CD@@ U which could come to 23 per cent .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
Lin@@ ing would come to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
despite a slight loss of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , the green air@@ less losses related to the heav@@ al land day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be present with 3 per cent each in the country .
in the Berlin &apos;s Dep@@ os@@ enh@@ ance boxes , the SPD continued only to 23 per cent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .

Nokia 9000 Comm@@ unic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in Time : 20 years ago , the Nokia Comm@@ unic@@ ator came on the market .
the successor is dominated by the world - his manufacturer has lived a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as tough as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ er and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ ck .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , that would be now sufficient for about two rare memory .
a iPhone is now ex@@ trad@@ ited at least 16 gig@@ s .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Comm@@ unic@@ ator &quot; came in front of exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers of devices can still buy in the internet , but they come some@@ how from the stone time of the internet service .
20 years ago , Comm@@ unic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced a few months earlier on the computer fair Ce@@ BIT in Hannover as the &quot; Office in the West@@ ental format . &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone was sent to a lot : SMS and e @-@ ma@@ ils could be sent and received by fax , the Comm@@ unic@@ ator could be reached .
even the access to websites was possible with HTML brow@@ s@@ ers , even though qu@@ ely slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the cell could be like a laptop to be opened .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average price of a Smartphones in Germany was € 392 in 2015 .
no one could fl@@ ags in August 1996 that the Comm@@ unic@@ ator would become the beginning of the Smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the cell division of the Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ r@@ ell@@ ous Des@@ aster , was finally sold to Microsoft .
the market today reign today , all of which were much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere , that is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone amounted to 555 million units alone .
the global sales of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ ongoing stores of the many app @-@ suppliers and telec@@ omm@@ unications services .
around the Smartphone , a whole industry was created in the meantime .
the decisive break@@ through to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple b@@ oss Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World &apos;s introduction to the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three machines in one : a music player , a telephone and a internet communication , everything is easy to use via touch screen .
the seal of Apple began , still today is the iPhone &apos;s most important product in the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has got to fight .
they now have Apple and Asian provider like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its in@@ vention .
on average , every German is now 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; we need to learn all the smartphone &apos;s smartphone , &quot; said just Jan@@ ina Sp@@ here , in the Siemens board for personnel .
permanent access is now considered Flu@@ ch and blessing at the same time .
England must expand the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local commun@@ es and in all London , but in all land renewal and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
for me , the largest attrac@@ tion He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we used a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions from the games are benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be able to achieve new opportunities for ort@@ s@@ ans@@ er and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we already have 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment at the airport environment .
as they pre@@ dict us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the enlar@@ gement of He@@ ath@@ rows is too big .
I was told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ er had un@@ right and they are wrong with He@@ ath@@ row in 2012 .
there are always obst@@ acles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each other .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
expansion is an option to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 billion at a share growth and create a powers of skills and employment both to leave the airport as well as in all GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion for infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport controller , was built up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third track that is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London London London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m conf@@ id@@ ent that the enlar@@ gement of He@@ ath@@ row is also one of his .
it &apos;s time to expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a powers of skills and jobs that can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies that earn online money will earn money with online payment tests , display blocks , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block indic@@ ating on his Des@@ k@@ pot side , Ad@@ block Plus published an b@@ log@@ an in which it could update its filter in the program to block again advertising in social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his Des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the coding of its advertising items to det@@ ect the display of advertising it , which is part of the site advertising is to be challeng@@ ed .
but ad@@ mits announced that it has found a new way to walk the new codes .
in a b@@ log@@ post , the spokes@@ person by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the inv@@ asive Open Source community and the out@@ ings already since the in@@ vention of ad lock@@ ers in G@@ ange is &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon after a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company dedicated for social media in the fight is a strong Indi@@ c@@ ate , such as discussed ar@@ ous@@ es att@@ ack@@ ers for the industry .
according to a survey from Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people are attracted by the last year , nearly four times as much as 2013 .
with 1,@@ 03 billion active users , representing on Facebook about their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 per cent of advertising items from Fac@@ e@@ books .
the company has seen it on the desktop PC , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ e@@ books mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram .
advertising on desktop computers makes a sufficient large proportion of income , such as Facebook the investment of such st@@ epper than wor@@ th@@ while appears .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that it would be to update his &quot; display pre@@ ferences tab &quot; to have increased more control over them .
on Thursday it claimed Facebook that ad@@ vent@@ u@@ bl@@ ate new filters would be able to block content on the side because they are no advertising .
&quot; for the users that is no positive experience , so we are planning to adv@@ ise the problem , &quot; divided a spokes@@ person on Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication .
display block@@ ers are an incredi@@ bly means , so we have concentr@@ ating on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to lay out more control into the hands of the people .
woman at susp@@ end su@@ icide on Swiss motorway
the victims was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a susp@@ ected su@@ icide by several vehicles on a motorway .
the incid@@ ent happened on the A1 nearby Morges in the canton of Wa@@ adt shortly after midnight .
a woman made in the Dun@@ kl@@ en &quot; in a act of bran@@ ching &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud .
it is evi@@ dent that a Swiss ages in the age of 49 , who were driven by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been identified , but some are still identified , the police , who , as well as any witnesses of the incid@@ ent , were to report .
it was opened an investig@@ ations , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such situation , the G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
but it remains to wait if one of the driver will be displayed .
was a viol@@ ation avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - which ran a person in Dun@@ kl@@ es on the free@@ way - was decided that the motor@@ ists didn &apos;t go out that a pe@@ de@@ strian prec@@ inc@@ ing in the night run on the highway , as it was named in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ y@@ ist policy was acqu@@ itted when she had over a man and killed one night in August 2014 , one night on the A1 near Pay@@ ern .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old vic@@ tim had dr@@ unk , and became un@@ consci@@ ous on the road .
the court ruled that the polic@@ ist@@ in -- that had an emergency call -- on a just@@ ified way , and that the presence of a man on the street is a &quot; perfect exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judges .
any further information about the incid@@ ent on Thursday near Morges , should be seen under the police at the number 021 6@@ 44 83 46 or 021 6@@ 44 44 44 .

scientists at the God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus and algorith@@ ms to discover those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once could have been identified .
scientists have previously explained that the slow turn of Venus could be declared by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere could have gone up slowly .
the model ligh@@ ted the to@@ po@@ graphy of the early Venus .
the planet pres@@ um@@ ably more dry regions as de Earth , but had once enough water and geo@@ graphic vari@@ ability to har@@ bor life and before faster dis@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ ands the slow rotation of Venus on the front of Venus , nearly two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS sci@@ entist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this is heated to the surface and produces rain , which causes a thick layer of clouds , which causes the surface of a large part of sunshine .
the results are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a story of Venus , which is res@@ em@@ bles the evolution , which is thought of plan@@ etary teachers .
although it was likely to be inhabited , the Venus was exposed to much heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
their oc@@ eans have ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burnt by the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
when her Hydro@@ gen with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in the ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy jo@@ ins the coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a slight comp@@ ilation in decision @-@ making of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will immediately be looking for a new Trainer .
in the last three years , I &apos;ve got my duties as a leader and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ es , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy was written in a statement .
I have thought a long and much more in the course of summer , as I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations perfectly suited to the organisation .
he must also have a comp@@ ilation of decisions at decisions , influ@@ ences the performance of the teams .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had been present , Roy am May 23 , 2013 , with him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we estimate all what he has done for our organisation and would like to give him the future for the future .
Roy was hon@@ ored during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the League .
he led the club on 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed in each of the two recent years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nord@@ es@@ ee@@ ö@@ lar@@ in supp@@ er again talks on , put strike in
the workers strug@@ gles to be exposed to the northern part of the North Sea zones , while all the disp@@ utes are on table for a new inter@@ ventions to the table , negoti@@ ating negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the un@@ ite and r@@ ms trade unions , we confirm that we begin to begin the inten@@ tion of current stre@@ aming process , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions in the next weeks that will start the beginning next year to move the problems .
the trade unions said that its last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage reduction of up to 30 per cent .
Wood Group has short@@ ened this year against its contrast in the North Sea around 9 percent due to neg@@ ativity .
the company is followed by a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional c@@ rank@@ ings to the company needed , to come through the market growth .
as a result of his thousands of people dis@@ missed and plans announced his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ al det@@ ectors with the British energy companies BG Group ration@@ alized .
energy companies are located due to the lower crude oil prices under pressure , a economic situation which had to leave the decision by the British in June , the European Union .
in the beginning of this week , Dave Anderson met the Scott@@ ish member of this week to discuss one of the greatest occup@@ ations that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star of Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ mo@@ teles@@ cope has helped us to collect the complete catalog of rotation rates under the stars of the star of Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help to understand astronom@@ ers why stars are rotating in con@@ stellation , as well as in which context the rotation time with the planet is standing .
&quot; we hope that we went through the Compare of our results with other con@@ stellation , more about the relationship between the mass of a con@@ stellation , his age and even the history of his solar system , said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a resear@@ cher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ run of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is 445 light years from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , can now reach an adult age .
she now turn off the fastest .
to top rot@@ ating rates this stri@@ ped star of large amounts of stars .
since this winch go through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star is pure , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each con@@ stellation , by playing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able con@@ stellation -- as s@@ ay@@ ings -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates shows that a massive star is s@@ lower than less than less .
Reb@@ ull is compar@@ es the stars with dancers , even larger stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ble are turning smaller than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ y@@ ades we see that slow Rot@@ ten@@ ors sees to be massive rot@@ ors , better toler@@ ated against faster Rot@@ ten@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades are so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ m@@ ical lab to compare it qu@@ alities as rotation rates .
&quot; the star of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of both directions in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still much before us what we would like to learn more like the same as , When , and Why stars her Rot@@ ation rates demanded to slow down their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ els and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will be published in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a contro@@ versi@@ al bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ Star enters from
the te@@ ars run by Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US @-@ Bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ Star in the best days of base .
after his emot@@ ional response announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will bear the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays one last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I tell &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
in 2009 Rodri@@ guez was elected as a valuable player in the le@@ ague , he won the World Series with the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
his description under a ten @-@ year treaty came to him 27 million US dollars annually .
by the end of the contrast , 31 December 2017 , he served as a consultant and youth coach - with full content .
when player paid it Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
with 696 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for its teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas rank@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and in 2005 he abol@@ ished the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e Ma@@ ys show two more bas@@ eb@@ all players in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is still not included in the f@@ usion hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - Nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field , so contro@@ versi@@ al is his appearance outside the square .
in 2009 , the Super@@ star was called &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have forbidden ster@@ o@@ ids .
in August 2013 , he was imprisoned in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ and@@ al by the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main susp@@ ects , year for years of anti @-@ aging an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal disp@@ ute , the Sper@@ re was reduced to 162 enco@@ unters .
&quot; the le@@ ague could even have a pleasure for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
his dep@@ ortation days are not dis@@ appo@@ inting .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ le@@ gen@@ ds will get the big stage again , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include Ab@@ and@@ ds Tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; ätz@@ te Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the act@@ ress of Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , sym@@ pat@@ ched conf@@ ections of the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ val@@ en Boston Red SO@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski
knowing : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ing sample , weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ thrown by the first official d@@ op@@ ing event .
a distinc@@ tly athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition , the first official d@@ op@@ ing cases had become known for the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese flo@@ at Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ ste@@ ep@@ le ch@@ ase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weigh@@ t@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the ohn@@ eh@@ in Crit@@ ical Athletics compet@@ itions this news will come to the un@@ time .
over the last Sunday the Di@@ ure@@ tics has been demonstrated by hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ az@@ ide , which is used as m@@ ask@@ ent means for d@@ op@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Tribunal CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only about 0,@@ 09 seconds they missed the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the fo@@ oth@@ ills over 50 m Freestyle to participate .
Ch@@ en has applied for the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing in the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
National Association of the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with investig@@ ations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will be merg@@ ed with the International Sports Tribunal CAS and will accept the judgement . &quot;
for the first time in history , not more the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanctions for athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive re@@ hear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
she was un@@ guilty , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; explained the female track .
according to the report , it is supposed to act as the b@@ anned substance for blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ es EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa did not sus@@ pen@@ ed , according to the B@@ NT it should also be positive as a positive test .
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w merg@@ ed immediately with the critic@@ ism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ sman did not move the right batt@@ les . &quot; he said , &quot; We &apos;re Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are not excluded . &quot;
so about all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ters are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was known to the London @-@ Olympi@@ as@@ ie@@ ger in the class up to 85 kg as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had been tested for three days earlier on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both exp@@ ires the in@@ gest@@ ion , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is a further serious blow for rep@@ utation of the entire sport@@ ing art .
the world association IAAF world had the complete Russian team up to one exception because of system@@ atic Dop@@ ing , also the L@@ äu@@ fern@@ ation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the former Ver@@ tex had also pul@@ led in China for severe disp@@ utes between the athletes .
in the Fr@@ ench@@ man Camille Lac@@ o@@ urt at the Chinese Olympi@@ as@@ ie@@ ger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple &quot; .
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle , I want to pass over me , I said Lac@@ o@@ urt in the French radio .
Sun rose also in the centre of a med@@ itation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for Dop@@ ing prayer , &quot; said this .
Sun was positive in 2014 at the Chinese championships for the stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ az@@ id@@ in , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
datab@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses H@@ acker her del@@ et@@ om
programmer from expl@@ oring malware , aims to provide company and are successful .
according to a current survey of the malware , mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months at least once , some several times of attack a attack with ex@@ press@@ ors software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of the companies have already had the target of an R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware revi@@ val .
40 percent of the victims paid by the per@@ pet@@ rators required by the per@@ pet@@ rators to use the increased systems and data to be able to use data .
the per@@ pet@@ rators specialized their de@@ press@@ ors software according to the ob@@ serv@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack on attack network .
they are successful there , the potenti@@ ally too high @-@ end soldering pay significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; we &apos;re currently observed an exhau@@ st@@ ive fast evolution of poll@@ ut@@ ants , &quot; declar@@ es Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Marc@@ in Kle@@ cz@@ ynski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most mal@@ aria were still designed to send advertising .
then discovered the Tattoo Stencils software for themselves .
only , private users were the goal , but the change to the company had been exhau@@ sted in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , seek@@ s to search for un@@ successful files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as to archives of images and videos .
this files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and ext@@ ingu@@ ishing the origin@@ als sustainable .
after that , the software will be presenting the demands of the ex@@ press@@ ors .
to get the access code to the files , the vic@@ tim must have money - mostly in the form of cr@@ ypto@@ ung Bit@@ coin .
but when private use the personal photo database on the game , it goes to companies for sen@@ sible customer data or project datab@@ ases , without which stands the production .
accordingly , the damage is higher when a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware decre@@ ases .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent even the business activities had to break completely under a fall in life .
in Germany , several hosp@@ itals were victims of attacks , whose patient could be threatened by the loss of illness .
&quot; we say to the victims : do not pay , you pay only the problem , &quot; explains the Kle@@ cz@@ ynski
but 80 to 90 per cent of the companies have to pay their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to re@@ ject at stand@@ still in the operation of per@@ pet@@ rators in operation .
the h@@ acker again know that and try to build a good rep@@ utation .
in a recent study , the safety awar@@ eness of F @-@ Secure reduces the user to contact with the ex@@ press@@ ors and come to the result : the per@@ pet@@ rators are actually to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you explain to their O@@ pf@@ ern per chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , teach freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t files .
and they are rede@@ emed to payments from a few hundred thousand euros , the company must pay hard negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit Sum@@ men to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potenti@@ ally high and relatively ris@@ ol@@ eic acid prof@@ its from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware revi@@ val , the h@@ acker is always professional and share the work , explains security sex@@ ually Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski from An@@ tivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person may write a p@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
likely it is likely that there are three or four people .
the programmer sell their cont@@ amin@@ ant software in the form of a software construction kit to the actual Er@@ press@@ er .
the previously malware kit developed by malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in the scope of delivery , a adjustment feature , such as smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and fire can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the press@@ ors are looking for another h@@ acker to spread the fresh@@ ly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log@@ ging in one of the for@@ ums in the under@@ floor , buying the set of a crime and commissioned to install the software on as possible thanks to many PCs .
the payment is made by inf@@ ecti@@ ous computers .
&quot; usually , cri@@ min@@ als carry out sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known in many companies that secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT Respon@@ sible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of respon@@ si@@ bilities , using R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware using a file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ or software .
accordingly , the per@@ pet@@ rator already pursu@@ es new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data is no sufficient threat to successful development , the per@@ pet@@ rators instead of sensitive data like about customer lists or price cal@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of Marc@@ in Kle@@ cz@@ ynski
that &apos;s the poll@@ ut@@ ants , depending on the type of data , more than earlier than earlier .
they could also take the per@@ pet@@ rators in the future completely new goals in the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Pre@@ con demonstrate safety for@@ scher , such as they could get associated with the Internet connected Ther@@ most@@ at .
in the middle of the winter , the open circuit of a der@@ art block@@ ed heating so many victims can be worth a drop @-@ money .
if the per@@ pet@@ rators then block@@ ed the heater to the future in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware couldn &apos;t be a theme in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and versatile
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda everything is packed : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the vers@@ at@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty rather over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz was really flexible as a result .
although the 1,60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot place in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond , it works closely .
the materials of the interior are well processed and are pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls below .
the HR @-@ V is versatile than comparable vehicles .
it is not only a boot storage of 453 l with high @-@ produced and 10@@ 26 l with hing@@ ed back arm@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical , than it sounds : the seat of the back bank let rise and offer storage space , which is covered by the bottom to the ce@@ il@@ ings .
the caff@@ eine can be well loaded , however , the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed range .
he is likely to make his work something qui@@ et@@ ly .
pleas@@ ing in everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there are still another engine : a 1,5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a 4 @-@ wheel drive is not available .
the behavior is balanced , a good com@@ promise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
the steering system is likely to be something direct .
the equipment can be desired in the tested Top @-@ version &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
for safety systems , the City @-@ Emerg@@ ency assist@@ ent ( works up to Tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ ision @-@ warning system and the trace of the trace .
the coll@@ is@@ ions were irrit@@ ated sometimes , because it has been rated many obst@@ acles than &quot; her@@ b@@ ah@@ ende objects . &quot;
very reliable works of the remote assistant .
and the Intelligent Tem@@ po@@ genic respon@@ ds to the traffic command and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t when needed .
the full connectivity is only available for the top quality : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , app integration and more .
two USB@@ - and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and can therefore be a bit dir@@ ty .
the around 2@@ 9000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest the petrol engine from 20000 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro .
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and versatile car .
airline har@@ vest@@ ed not : crash on flight bridge
there is no air@@ line li@@ able for the crash of a passenger bridge on the flying bridge .
for a liability is just under threat , which are typical for the air traffic , arg@@ um@@ ented the Ober@@ land@@ es@@ gericht ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the cl@@ am@@ ers had broken down at the crash of a crash .
however , the accident would have been going to pass anywhere in order to order a common life risk of life , so the court .
the airline has not had to pay poll@@ ut@@ ants .

but this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests were able to show the same symptoms .
in this case , a family was difficult to break@@ through and v@@ om@@ iting a family on the second day of their tur@@ key .
she spent nearly the total holiday in the room .
their disease led the holiday@@ makers back on a def@@ ective Kl@@ ä@@ ran@@ sfer , who supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ uted the se@@ wage water .
the family was the view that was a trip to work for lack - and def@@ endants against the promot@@ er .
before court , the acc@@ user had no success .
although it was def@@ ective in fact .
but the organiz@@ ers came only shortly before departure of the acc@@ user .
he had to go until then that the sea water was fine .
he had not viol@@ ated his information oblig@@ ations , so the judgment is .

the condition of several hotel guests - am@@ edi@@ ble by infection - give ear to a general life risk .
of 691 guests were only 38 people .

the government deci@@ ding and decided to act on terrorism at the same time .
safe is : our country will not answer violence with hat@@ red and split .
this tri@@ umph will not be crow@@ ned by the terror@@ ists .
if the offen@@ ders should leave the country , however , increase safety and strength , even the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will achieve a implementation of proposals by the federal election in 2017 .
he also announced another person@@ ality ampli@@ fication of the security forces , &quot; in medium @-@ four @-@ digit order form for more than several years . &quot;
Sym@@ path@@ olog@@ ic for terrorism has to be re @-@ pun@@ ishment again under penalty .

the last reason@@ ably well @-@ kept silence for doctors should continue to stay in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
however , in dialogue with the doctors , looking for solutions , how the end@@ ang@@ ing of citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at psych@@ ological collection .
in order to re@@ act a radi@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister , a better social support for necess@@ ities .
teachers have to be prepared better to dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the per@@ secution of cri@@ min@@ als in the special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is the use of inher@@ ited investig@@ ator .
SPD Chief Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contri@@ butes to increase safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior spoke out of action against action .
&quot; that was an ear plugs for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel was the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition and the abol@@ ition of the double national citi@@ zen@@ ship .
a general ban for the pro@@ hib@@ ited contents of the constitu@@ tional can be probl@@ ematic .
you can &apos;t offer everything that is re@@ jects , and I am the tr@@ ages of the Bur@@ ka .
we could speak about rules about the road traffic or witnesses to the court .

better traffic flow on the highway
regularly look at the up@@ side road - here a picture of November .
but this is supposed to change : the legal gu@@ ards should be extended .
this is a good news for all car , who are driving on the surrounding road on the surrounding road every evening when they continue via the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road building extends from the next Tuesday and wed@@ n@@ esday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the hammer street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
car driver can then drive directly from the hammer road right .
the great advantage : traffic divi@@ des early @-@ time to increase the total of the total of the federal part of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road crossing on the fe@@ eder is nerv@@ ous to the drivers , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the return to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the con@@ if@@ le gun on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , the traffic will get only one lane via motorway bridge .
the second track had to be covered before a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge does not have the required load capacity to increase the heavy duty .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected st@@ allion de@@ w , the compet@@ ence can not say .
however , to reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has a official reserve period until the year 2034 .

the traffic will be over on Tuesday and Wednesday at the opening time at the building site .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping dis@@ orders
in the evening you sh@@ ined for ever , in the morning there is no longer w@@ ach , in the morning there is no longer thinking about sleep .
that &apos;s all other than relaxing .
after all , there is a quarter of these problems in good company : according to Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep dis@@ orders and more than ten percent emp@@ ire their sleep frequently or permanently .
how external problems or sleep trouble ?
there are several forms of sleep dis@@ orders , and there can reach them diverse causes , emphas@@ ized Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , board member of the German Society of Schl@@ aff@@ or@@ sch@@ ung and Sle@@ ep medicine .
but what one is land@@ ed among them , but the In@@ som@@ nie , so is one input and sleep dis@@ order .
just that way , many people can find many people as un@@ satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German House association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what ′ s behind sleeping dis@@ orders ?
the causes of sleep dis@@ orders are complex .
there can be organic , psych@@ ic , or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medic@@ ations .
not rare is the sleep dist@@ ill expression of another disease .
&quot; very early aw@@ ak@@ ening is often common with a de@@ pression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors are dist@@ ress .
whoever has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc for example , can be bad@@ ly lie , w@@ akes all two to three hours and should be p@@ inn@@ ed , on all everyday problems and gre@@ etings , there is white example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep with sleep dis@@ orders ?
those who affects a period of one month in at least three nights per week , should not be affected by the day , he should go to the doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look very different : it is de@@ be@@ aten , ti@@ red , ir@@ sle@@ pt , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , has easily irrit@@ ated , has flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ations or physical compl@@ aints such as stomach or he@@ ada@@ ches .
to relie@@ ve sleep trouble , it is important to find their causes .
as treatment options , there are behavi@@ oral changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or drugs - classic sleep tablets only in the exceptional cases and maximum for two weeks - ask .
in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ que , head of the inter@@ discipl@@ inary @-@ medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Berlin .
therefore one should first apply to sleep problems first to the house physician , turn right .
it can clar@@ ify with investig@@ ations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
to study in sleep laboratory , medical prof@@ ession , for example , with re@@ spir@@ atory trac@@ id resistance , in certain daily fatigue , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a break@@ age of trouble .
they don &apos;t need to prepare for the study .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not make a lunch sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ que .
after the short@@ age , one walks into the bed in his normal period .
in addition to electro@@ des the body is wearing a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera covers the sleeping on the ceiling .
how can claim the problems in the handle ?
there are quite many positions , where you can place for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping and ste@@ al times , not too long in bed , on the day not to sleep , not television to sleep , alcohol avoid@@ ing and night not to watch the watch , then you will start immediately , and that &apos;s not all .
what the Jungle camp with lack of med@@ alli@@ ons at the swimming pool
the former German sw@@ imm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been dis@@ appointed by Facebook to the dis@@ appo@@ inting out of the D@@ SV team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he took over the first world championship in Doha , and presented his first world record at the same time .
now , the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has set up his Facebook users in front of his critic@@ ism of the Ex @-@ team mate .
&quot; in a country in which an Olympi@@ as@@ ie@@ ger 20.000 € premium gets and a jung@@ le King 150,000 € should no one gets about lack of med@@ it@@ ches , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on its Facebook page .
the convey@@ or system in the swimming sport be bad , the d@@ op@@ ing control is very good .
with this , we can not compete with countries that promote very much , and on the topic d@@ op@@ ing not so accurate or even possible .
&quot; I say not that the controls will be dis@@ continued here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
to launch a com@@ eb@@ ack , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly how to keep it with countries .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t have a certain time in front of WM / OS from independent control functions of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A may not take part , &quot; calls for the election to Hamburg , who now has a ice hall .
airport : Ban@@ de by Bag@@ di@@ eben
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the airport Düsseldorf
civ@@ ilian Govern@@ ments of the Dus@@ seldorf Police managed the capture of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the crime susp@@ ects were committed as a Ban@@ de on several T@@ ash@@ en- and bag@@ gage allowance .
at 21.@@ 30 pm , civ@@ ilian officials reported a ban@@ ker back in the area of Düsseldorf , which was known as the police officers from recent the@@ ft .
the two women and two men had been committed several del@@ ic@@ te since mid @-@ July of this year , were employed and particularly profession@@ ally .
the Speci@@ alists of Cri@@ mean Comm@@ iss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove the th@@ ief , specifically to just@@ ification of criminal off@@ ences after Germany , four acts .
they took over 15,000 euros in total .
Alt@@ bau , a couple of Lind@@ enb@@ ü@@ chen , in between there are still a rest of the pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not work on the first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; end@@ ang@@ ered locations . &quot;
pass the road from the east to the west , one comes along with places , refresh@@ ed children &apos;s garden and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house , someone is ug@@ ly to@@ ug@@ ly . &quot;
opposite of a L@@ id@@ l , which will soon be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
articles about this &quot; tr@@ endy district , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are preferred during the last weeks , however , with burning cars .
the reason is the house with no . 94 : once was it occupied , the residents of the apartment has been occupied , however on the ground floor are still space @-@ owned and used for events .
especially the Berlin &apos;s inner sen@@ ator handle left several times for a hard ancest@@ or of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of aut@@ onomous authority .
after 22 June the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were cle@@ ared , with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team car from the place , locked parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers in the order of the unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided to have been illeg@@ ally illeg@@ ally , and a day later police and construction workers under the Ju@@ bel of symp@@ ath@@ y and residents .
in this summer of summer , the street is peaceful : parents go with children , sitting on the office at the office in front of the houses in the sun , other enter@@ tain@@ ing themselves in late .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects , there are a primary school and kinder@@ gardens .
left violence is not the chief of many people : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z area since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which has three children living here , especially from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they divide the wor@@ ry before asc@@ ents and Gent@@ iles .
it does not sound after a pine , who wish multi@@ cast pol@@ ishing in front of v@@ and@@ al@@ ous le@@ fts .
the hor@@ ror , the Berlin &apos;s inner sen@@ ator and the police det@@ ect their neigh@@ bo@@ urs , obviously not , obviously not .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Berlin actually was a traditional working volume , which also has to come to the rest of the city a lower average and high poverty risk .
also house occupied and the new@@ born residence are already long to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former DDR , including almost the entire main@@ land street throughout the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the mot@@ hers had been cle@@ ared by a regular road , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are part of the people living today , which they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly the magn@@ ets for tourists and electoral ber@@ lin@@ ers from around the world : with them now share them from GDR and former HA@@ USB@@ ES@@ ET@@ ZER their Kie@@ z .
this is also not@@ ice@@ able for rent , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they can det@@ ect them by adding discs or fresh@@ ly kn@@ itted fac@@ ades which were dis@@ card@@ ed with color sh@@ orts .
no other road was so often mentioned together with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome Viol@@ ence &quot; in this year .
a reason that not all the neigh@@ bo@@ urs know that as a problem may be , that they are not affected by the crime of cri@@ min@@ ality , as a body viol@@ ation , statistics found almost entirely against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make non@@ damage , ten@@ ds to make ten@@ sion@@ ing rather the new@@ builds and recently renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house next to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 years in a rental building .
what is violent acts , she is an essential : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bo@@ urs , that they should not be .
the famous burning car will give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er already no longer .
for the studied architect , her street is no de@@ cri@@ mination point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more each other than what is different . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deli@@ ber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
therefore , it was also important that the people returned its streets : from the police , politics and media , which suddenly claimed responsibility for the neighborhood in July .
but in the eyes of Be@@ inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away from their super@@ structure in the former building , which the ancient residents are dis@@ placed .
&quot; this is the last of the property , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good g@@ orge , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not gu@@ ar@@ thei@@ s . &quot;
but what should I do if one never stops ?
there is a fru@@ stration among all sides fru@@ stration , also with the police and the inhabitants .
in favour of the bre@@ d , Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer became a little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
whoever goes up , should be aware of that - just like someone who dra@@ ws into a tree @-@ quarter that can be bad@@ ly damaged by noise .
all only with the names of the people have asked , therefore asked to be called with their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le is New Re@@ fuge@@ e Repres@@ entative
An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le is the contacts in terms of integration and organization .
in addition she is social worker .
since July An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social educational educational support is supporting the management of Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she looks as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working from refugee aid , administration , authorities and who otherwise still communic@@ ated .
Reg@@ ine customer suggest@@ s that the honor has more than th@@ ank@@ ful that De@@ usch@@ le is now that De@@ usch@@ le now is , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ion , which has a problem .
so , some - less sp@@ ott@@ led as much rather on the wide range of care areas - meant as the administration wanted to write the site .
looking for an administrative force with a tal@@ ent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
but administration is not her central area , we@@ ep An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le .
especially to the organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network business .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for approximately six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place within three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le Ehr@@ en- and General Ac@@ tors supported .
there are large and small issues , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new container in the Was@@ enstraße
a serious problem has been available since some time , apartments for the connection material , which have been approved .
for the connection , the commun@@ es is responsible .
you need to accommodate the refugees in their own or appropriate rooms .
the cost of construction , rental or renovation of this accommodation needs to bear the commun@@ es itself .
the respon@@ si@@ bilities changes to the Comm@@ rat@@ ory of the Comm@@ une and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not everyone has to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time than very difficult .
de fac@@ to find the administration no private apartments .
it didn &apos;t work so far , there was necessary to be on private apartments , as De@@ usch@@ le .
therefore , I must be ch@@ illed , as it is so beautiful .
so soon you will be installed new container in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with fl@@ ats it is not done .
Per@@ spective is the key@@ word , is Reg@@ ine Client and An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead @-@ stay there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and help activities for refugees and mig@@ rants , who must be folded or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many work in the building yard or help Haus@@ master , non @-@ profit @-@ profit work - and motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , as An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le reports .
it h@@ opes that the work leads to a positive effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
he means , but not only work .
the day is a fixed structure , say De@@ usch@@ le and Client .
people would have to develop a refuge .
so there are special offers like sport , contacts with hom@@ e@@ erie and above all language courses .
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so also here administration and hon@@ orary volunteers .
it be central that the refugees will get the feeling in Germany and welcome them in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain the refugees that it will take it , and it may be the time sen@@ sible sleep , for example with language courses .
anyone who developed somet@@ ime could not help , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be un@@ profit@@ able to integ@@ rate himself .
the distinct majority are motiv@@ ated .
problem cases , but also says the client , &quot; people , in which all goes nothing . &quot; the work of De@@ usch@@ le and client is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is a &quot; mamm@@ oth entry . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two according to recent prior events of ra@@ dic@@ alization , also in a small municipality such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is n@@ ai@@ v we call . &quot; a resi@@ dual risk of could could not close her . &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ ates be the hel@@ per .
these incid@@ ents may also be subject to refugees .
they would have fear that the attacks were completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they don &apos;t have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main and hon@@ ors must keep on site and keep on activities in the region .
they always have always in the background that soon a new stored on refugees and mig@@ rants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer , she@@ ath the politics .
actually it is fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived , where we would like &quot; says An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine Client also makes it clearly that the Ur@@ bacher can already integ@@ rate the previous people to integ@@ rate the previous people .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need to help them , both women are hidden .
the political world situation is so comp@@ lic@@ ated , because there is no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with Hel@@ icop@@ ter
the police helicop@@ ter fle@@ w about an hour long for approximately one hour .
two unknown men are violent at the Friday morning at 8.50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a family house in Lind@@ en@@ weg .
the inhabitants sur@@ prised the two and sm@@ ote the un@@ hol@@ de in the run .
both men were about 1.65 to 1,70 meter , probably m@@ asked , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black ho@@ oded pul@@ ler .
they fle@@ dged towards downtown .
the police continued several strikes , as well as a police helicop@@ ter .
the mem@@ orial was un@@ successful without success .
possibly the unknown could be indeed close to the apartment and / or during their run .
