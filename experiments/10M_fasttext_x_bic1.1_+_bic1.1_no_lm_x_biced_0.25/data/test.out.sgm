<seg id="16">German conscientious cross, silver bay leaf, Champions tour-player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Effects in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and investing the TTP's trade agreement - that's aim to prevent both Clinton and trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, inone are the two US presidency, however, in control and energy policies, as well as in a base question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The distinction in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a general, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warned as the state of the economy can - with tax and regulatory.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton kinseming the economy to death and regulating, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be very different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return regulatory massively, and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates, for professionals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">By contrast, Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has received notifying opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the tax would be increased to the rich man, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the mute invests, trump and Clinton become almost worsened.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidates announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State Investitioners in infrastructure are the classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state-based Teaparty-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Trump, there could still be partitioned discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and drive to the United States to drive back in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil carriage is also possible to cancel the areas in so protected areas, to cancel the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">By contrast to their investment program, Clinton wants to expand the renewable energies and calls for: "a country will create the super energy power and create a million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it, that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transectional trade agreements, don't want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the United States don't want to isolate the international trade, but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those should also be paid better, calls for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump into this question is not very clear: once he says, The minimum wage must be, then he says, he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the next months is likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side is trump, who wants to increase the economy and citizens to increase the growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critic keep it before, so the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants to pay at least from the rich man that they will pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every woman-flying woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost already for everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they come in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">One house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen sitting four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He guesses with great eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother starred on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they know that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">You smiled short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scene affects normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the area manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid in Bavaria, and employs among others with the theme of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are convolatile.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-fled women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up the setup together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhances.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unlongest, it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are no - not available as a visitor too.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a Wachmann in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who made here comes along with sexual violence with sexual violence." says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they were politically persecuted, because they were killed or death, or because their families send them as a hope to Europe," she tells them. "</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, the other reasons for the escape: "many steal themselves secretly, because they don't see any other out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In her homeland, they have done experience with sexual violence, twins, honourings, slavery, or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, the flight goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, tug for a bottle of water a sexual action is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected from their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whoever believe that the end as soon as they are in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here women would have undertaken women in refugee camps often as mindery and worse and worse.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is that about 90 percent of women who live in the mouth of the Munich north, traumatised, it is estimated.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are not voluntarily created."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women may be so usual that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they drink not, open about the explanation, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">Because they often do not help, it would need more accommodations for them, calls Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question, whether they are waged from a similar project as in Munich in their breeding area, will answer some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken there is not something about the governments of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In fact, women are not separated from the government alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are rooms only for all women and their children in a joint venture, district and central franken.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament will be asked that women are separated from men to be housed by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study that was published for the Committee, it is: "it is very important that men and women are separated."</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or become men and women have been housed together, it can come to - persistent violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower room should be separated and easily accessible for women, is in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">Like very the women of this protection needy, you can read at Andels, which there are at the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has talked about us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">One might make a second house easily.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of external headers"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a Geste that finished a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give her hands and an official end of eight months of long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish action in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot teach me that Ankara reconciliation this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was the hand, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But putting a smile in smile, and he barely visible warmth, even for his return conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan was repeatedly repeated by his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also said that the relationships in Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that the Erdogan would have happened that would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me the enthusiasm rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin is irradiant, sustainable cooling showed that the state of Russia had not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, which he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of an Russian campaign bombers on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided from and accuse Ankara, Russia into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was even greater, since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The showcase rebuild again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once it seemed to happen, the Turks would bear the Turks for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the most serious, the debt securities issued that geographic has benefited from illegal oil trade in areas Syrians who will receive the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He lodged this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was why Putin was held only because Putin received the president of Erdogan the excuse, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first line all friends which he can get, after the last month at a failed coup led almost its amphift.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated attacks on Turkey have also been shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economical motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have met Turkey hard - in particular the ban from charter flights, each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agent and charter companies will simplify if the flights may be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal cultivation of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week predicted the state television budget fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural flows will be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated like this: "tourists long, tomatoes for long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is due to the West, since its reaction to the attempted was considered a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">The persisting Groll about the Schneckentempo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to draw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian President of the Russian President won a bonus that he required for the chosen state aid for the chosen state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is well-understanding of Moscow for Moscow also has a deep sitting anxiety before regimplants.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glanced palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as it was described to me a analyst, "Alliance of foreign versaries" depicted two countries that are cast off from the West and feel good.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nonetheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still large differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace-makers, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be directories that after almost three hours of their presidents are coming on the press conference, that they could not striped out the topic once again.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey vermied it abident on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to betw this.</seg>
<seg id="46">It's not a clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months, enemy sweets - and given the potential of the potential for a perfect disaster, as NATO member, Turkey, the Russian battlecjet, it is certainly better to talk the two heads of state at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important role of government to support your activities as President of the Government and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smile?</seg>
<seg id="14">In this step, Moscow made secretly estranged from Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the most trusted in Vladimir Putin and works for Soviet intelligence in the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted in television, both men had to return to their own request at his own request.</seg>

<seg id="19">Lies here the episode of a kind of Machtkampf?</seg>
<seg id="20">The white currently no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was appointed as a potential president, would like to guide the Russian environmental policy - going on great sceptisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who cited on the site of Kreml, Ivanov said it is true that I have asked in a conversation that I could have been able to trust this very complicated Posten - they could almost say - weight of four years to trust.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it represents, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential management for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov recorded the Posten in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>

<seg id="28">When Putin was called upon the power, he called Ivanov than one of five people, to whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov was estimated that Ivanov could become the second term of Putin on Putin, since a third term served Putin against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, near the allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>

<seg id="22">There are 500 apartments for the year 2020 alone.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating, how the world changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenage children and child is not able to go outside, but rather will prefer to spend their free time to deal with screens, has been disrupted during the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">For Pokemon Go, people go to fetch people from the sofa and to be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen at the beginning of the TV was limited to video, and then limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it's great to see that technology and activities are not complete each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I beckled me of course on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were created on the characters in the 1990s (later a character set, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of the Popkultur the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days, Pokémon Go again had more users as a Tinder, and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players will go out with their smart phones and search for Pokémons that were taken with a GPS, once they were found once again, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "caught."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game, when she was younger, she graduated from the Wahn and jumped for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps, which makes the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiques, a app for Apple Watch, the 35,000 users prosecuted the Washington Post recently, that within two days after the market launch of the game, the number of participants followed up every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company knows not, who plays poker émon Go - it can only look up the raw data for performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public explanatory tampers to health, people want to take care about 30 minutes, "" from the sofa "and" every day are active. "because many public messages are subject to health boring and out of people who look forward.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nonetheless, the importance of sport can not be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives Sport drives, reduces its opportunities to explore cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list to share which is too long to perform them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of the health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close up on the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is mürric playspell, which must always complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if your smartphone apps like Fitbit already follow our activity, they gave us not a reason to drive sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New will lose its kingdom and the use will be retrofitted with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to the gamemons success, it will give more games to make apps and virtual reality with the activation in the real world and can help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we Simone, Gabby and Laurie need</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I present myself under the Frauenolannick in the Turns and consists of more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I joined every summer games since 1984 and the United States had never been dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three gymnast, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired for many young girls of other skin paint.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the Catholics is going, making each proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has set the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female Turning inside a Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows might.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas, Gabby Douglas was celebrated a surprising Olympic and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be a witness of the three-fold world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez as they were unexpected, but most of the Gymasticroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone the fourth, heterosexual American woman was awarded at an individual multi-day event for women in gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sports, but they are not seen in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it to the olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics are only four gymnast in the crew. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns is a expensive sports and Turner first line in private gym, that cost of the parents, facilities, travel, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families). the list can continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sorts are in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these promises, the Turner will get its total training and that is for families a teures and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer from Laurie Hernandez, have both their athlete, since they started with the Turns.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must be inspired by the churches of Aun, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a beading and easier access.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gades of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have commanded free and affordable turbines in Harlem for over 15,000 urban adolescents (especially black and hispanic) and national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expansion to Detroit (my home town) to provide the youth-qualitative turbocharged gymnast, who earn the opportunity to learn from this amazing Olympic sports.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and cripity for the Spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers a lifelong benefits for health and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, which bring thousands of young girls to care for the Turns and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is a so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team, and thank you so many young girls with different background motivated to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="4">Before leaving each object, he used a Luminometer to show herself and to show us what he will leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, titled "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was infiltrated, brought some surprising results to the daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinsing button of a train toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, can be completely degradably, but actually in a kitchen molecules more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with medical and medical specialist on the promotion of intestakteries, as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left, what he was built, more than a bad retaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intestms by taking the world, as well as wonderful things as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">By public Gelalter in railway stations up to rinse the task, the task ordered his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child, I was relatively unowned, what my health affects and I have put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and scoffewater."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified in his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing that he rejects, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proportions showed a luminometer value of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometrics are freshly woven hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to repetly after its luminance of 4000 units, while freshly washed hands a less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products produced Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the movie he says: "it comes to the worst, what I got into a toilet, near."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will find nothing here, because it is drunk here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company took Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both militarian bacteria and vitamin C and D, to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer something new in the consumer.</seg>

<seg id="25">We led crazy Brainstormings caused by that we said "Lass to call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest is applied to a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just over the products, we wanted to provide them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how they linked with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that the film shows that we have a great sense for humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let it be lost me to Ian, if he would have taught my respect for Ian, if he would have taught him, as the same Russian toilet, which is shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there was things that it was easier to bring Ian in which it was quite difficult to meet them and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have taken some of these dirty leakies on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of those surveyed Lactobacilli are particularly associated with the well-being of stomach and Darm and 58 per cent, that they contain at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holidays from North Rhine-Westphalia should not choose the land day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood them in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the landline will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the severity parliament decided already at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because Blöder than until now it is not: summer holidays, heat and land battle.</seg>
<seg id="6">The secret that are convinced by the election campaign are to be convinced of the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most beautiful holiday that are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not a secret, so not to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, practical problems: in the holidays are helper, the posters hang on air balloons, flyer, and will count towards the end of votes, only tired.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must still be enchanting just under the people over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase if you can say that it has just started.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU alition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998 has become the strongest party, is now clear behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting AfD cuts as strong Neuling AfD cuts and remain silent at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, he has an almost unobtrusive election campaign, sees one of his major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread horses and plains a little with the people, as it is also his legendary predecessor, Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors get cold feet and gives law Merkel at the bloom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, you "We create" I have to accelerate the ascent of the Lawspopulists, which is now considered to be the beautiful office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top training data, the Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if you do at wrong time at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to major documents; Merkel parliament's parliament on the North East.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group agree there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Sachsen as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it seemed too bad to hear from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel hear.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from the North East-CDU largely, the North East-CDU are largely on the usual election campaign and shopping centers with parumbrellas and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, it's costing, play only one "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also has reported that you have to destroy the base the base that it must be very hard to find out a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the left, the SPD, the Green Party: hardly available in the times of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU parliamentary election is also self-authorious: "you have to go, where they are weep, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Gold weddings, each birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering is called for a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the S & Ds was last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD was still clear with 35,6 percent in the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in the queries, allow you to create the jump to the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern Tugend in the holidays-not a modern Tugend and maintain their campaign.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," it is called Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green electoral bloody on track tests on trace mixers are among the holiday.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed, with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to meckers.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the work of construction work to begin at 5.30 o'clock in the morning and only at 8 pm, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything quite angry," told Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Construction site could be relocated on the midday to the half-time scheduled to be transferred to the south, until the end of October, everything is scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The entobt will also be the opposite of the construction work, for example, if it passes the institution of containers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has been applied on Monday to the south, and also the plywood of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen, and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been reconstructed in the resort.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now go on both sides by Ofterdingen, from B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The travel through the place seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since there were partly significant complaints, "says that responsible for the traffic management of the Rehabilitation manager Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The villagers of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to battle with more traffic noise, because many barrage sought and rather their Navi trusted as the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition to this, some trucks appeared in the areas of rural areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limit could not be observed, the assembly has strengthened the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant considerations," says King, who made itself once more on the location on the location.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute has been heated, there are already two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The speed was on the pace-30-zone with a speed of 77 km / h.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, it has become quiet.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business level at B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg is open to the road again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Into the cards, businessman don't like to look back.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 sanitation has led them to sales in sales, each one can ask you.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some are affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you have to do with the "final customer" less to do, so for other companies, the renovation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thomas Sulz is also at the Autohaus Maier with a "maximum slight decrease, but also a fact that of course," the drive is missing. "</seg>
<seg id="26">At the most exploited are the local road along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds significant words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already existing in existent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not just him, but all hostesses it was hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">It was missing the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rotateeil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be glad about every euro.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sales in revenue was over 50 percent. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The trensation have thrown his operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismissed the half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">When I had a company with 4,000 employees and the half would have been dismissed, the policy would have been reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt is on a request by Göhner whether there is a financial compensation that would answer to the advantage of the location, the host of the location on the B 27. now, they are even the drawbacks that give thanks to the sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner white from other land circles, where a little more generous handled was.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all case, Göhner is safe that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been located at 1715 here, and refers to the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="40">Others have more common areas now because of the complicated traffic and less frequent, it can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you don't come down, it is nice differently.</seg>
<seg id="42">After the end of the reconstruction works again, Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the effects of B 27 construction work on its clients for the largest crisis that experienced its hosts in its long-term history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner of all these words?</seg>

<seg id="11">After the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, after the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are now extensive more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">One piece is known, announced, announced that a new security authority is to take care of the crack-encrypted communication, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is also not the fact that Germany must have several EU regulations regarding flight details and armory law.</seg>

<seg id="18">It still persists this for mostly and challenging nothing, which have no chances of the coalitioner partner.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presents de Maizière too.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is partially partially in: he plans to deportation on deportation and more opportunities to deportation people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees to be picked up in the country, they should leave their smartphones and social media account for safety testing.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Dulce for ultimately asylum seeks, he wants to make some worse than so - about such, the offenders, or their papers deliberate to wear their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">One of them is politically and justified.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manches also works unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - at the inequation of thought of thought - the question: what does it actually do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not in billing that the attacks were from Ansbach and Würzburg refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people attended by the high refugee figures to safety.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that occupies the people, they have not left again in choice of campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is extremely high in the focus.</seg>

<seg id="36">In the last days there went high between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a gardeny strife about the equipment of the police, then via a security spolitarian ideas collection of some Unions-Interior, in which the deportal also require a Burka prohibition and a return from double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière tired here to reversal potent tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a return from the double pass, he is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">We ordered the debate in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">They reopen, be not sensible.</seg>

<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the promising re-revival of sound boards are not due to a boom in millennials that greet the new physical objects, but on Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who bought a record recently, are all precincing according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely most common busts.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by Hobbysammars - it has a emotional meaning: older record drives keep their feelings rather for itself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoying it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would follow a news report in television, I would follow the camera while I am sitting in the midst of a cage of Soho, a modest grind, my hands hold and a bit determining like: "so, let's take a closer look for us."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill out the buildings where an independent seller - is available as a handful fantastic turntables.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman, the camera for the next part, in which I stand in the immediate vicinity to various men in such shops and try, her age and mixture through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I from Sister Ray (total number: eight men, three men, middle age) into Reckless Records (total number: eight men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of the meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound boards, as shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by the house), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy plates that he had not work when she was published and once again, he sold young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things that I buy, are out of the late 60's, early 70s, who was released when I was 11 or 12. things I could be too young to buy them." he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who buy sheets are more likely to spend some time, and added to a time: "I don't smoke, and I drink not much too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works by Sister Ray, believes that many customers that meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave to people who are affected by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and go again to buy their old plates again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the discussions that I have led, people have taken away from their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their plates, he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the BoomBoom Appendices of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of panels?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business as Phonica to detect that platform provides a calm community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some plate fans feel overwhelmed from the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted power lines, from objects to watch the happy youth details.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a lean or possession of material owner than a kind of Trost," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors and I think it is so many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ spiritual.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" flap a staff from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April that nearly 50% of people who bought a record, they didn't hear them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey took also out that 41% have a turntables that they never use them, while 7% of those who buy a record, no turntables have.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I have a stack to Bossa Nova combatter.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Data number: three men, middle age) has an "trophy" of the revival. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came first recently here and said," I have no record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record plate, that I may provide them into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive-consuming, less musiklastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which are very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a supper audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are pairs around 70, tourists, make photos, teenagers and women mean age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the previous shops, the wild with the latest Synthesizer- and sexually active pop instead of experimental jazz pampered from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such a diversity to customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">No one of them looks hot, but nagelpsychic Traumata are difficult when one stands for about 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs for several minutes in the business and considers the variation of the sale plates.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is rather a mannequin man than a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">They don't deserves much, therefore the collecting is no real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or other way to hear, but the beauty of records is... "they drives with a loved singer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to tell it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of record lovers have inspired by Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give them a group of young teenager, I observed a group of young teenager for a moment for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter came to buy a Crosley record players.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential sheets for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can look at - perhaps because they are just fine, some so far above that it is impossible to do them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in fact that every attraction for these items are more money for the industry, and some customers could send in the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to weight complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, that is, most of the luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research institutes have also agree that the results of YouGov voices, they leave, at least in height of turnout in Soho, the large number of female collectors in the reality, platform and in online shops, innumerable.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are thought to work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety by the height of the Berwick Street and leaves by sheets, during which starring view of an insight, 30-year-old falsecrates most of the shoulders of medium men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has denied a tender offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live, low travellers.</seg>
<seg id="3">If a jurisdiction of this week argumented the authorities in Calais, that the state was supposed to sell 72 provisoric shops in the camp's goods, offering cigarettes to energy sources, hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisoric restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places will be low, because they would be paid up a parallel economy, which would not be paid out of the tax and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court with that the shops and restaurants are important, since the free meals that are supported by the state-supported association and other groups, not sufficient foods for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furthermore they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there are no legal basis for the instruction of people who had claimed the 72 provisional shops, but spatial that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "are absolutely procured."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants are to play a much bigger role as a people who live in extremely precipation conditions. "</seg>

<seg id="10">One of the places who was threatened by the pretravellers, was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Lagers, which is well-useful and 200 meals a day, English and French, as well as an advisory board for hundreds of protection needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji told a master class in handling, Side-stepping, descends, line run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille each.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was dismissed by the bad TrostPrize of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth in this day - and they could not be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they could beat out in New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals at the same day could fall back on the final day.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of what Fiji had a 15-man team affirised in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could probably be a Trost for GB - but it's probably not - that at least one of him will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost and Ryan every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slit is weaving, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began marveled and left the attacks GBS from Spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., when you run in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, as Osea colinisau in the corner of the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai add another attack from the right corner which he emigrated.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly undertaken the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A devastating tackle of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa, a third goal to get a third goal but it has got Fiji only.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute he lete Jasa Veremalua in the right corner of a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the reef ship and there were still more than one minute game time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preaching the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so when Fiji was born when Fiji was born to play 7, while GB still remains.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to half-time and ended the fijiic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova was running after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a test for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game ran already in favour of the South Korean sulaner, whose fans sang, flags, flags and dancing on the tribüne.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-scarfs with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The reef warned that Fijis rearmoured and bleached in the lawn in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">In early days Fiji Japan had defeated 20-5 in the semifinal with 20-5, South Africa drilled South Africa in a crisp match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half after the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork, and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tacster of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-23 team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning by the battle with the cancer of the trainer.</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold when playing this games, and what will be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing until the last, 220 hard Hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if it was only the dinghy were there, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainers Robin Williams, was all present in the second Olympiagold in a row without tax, the first women in the history of the British Sports, which put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolutely, however, your 39.ter is unprofitable, which is unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete, that reflects the surface with the elegance of schwars, which not reflects the type of the Triumphs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind any gold in the rowing is a Bataillon in consent helping to make the difference, and it was none to keep the difference than the coach that would not know this day when he was diagnosed this day when it was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he is crunchy.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable and did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather worst situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio has happiness that he could begin at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could begin to keep the interruption on a minimum, if it is under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it had to go better again.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it a greater greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of the victory there went their first thoughts on Williams, who spent a nervous morning to talk something more than otherwise to talk to work his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, which was in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is maybe something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is only repeated, how much I mean, and Helen and Helen and also Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would have no man, a massive Danke is on him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person to exercise or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no lost in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm that could not play their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to complete Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, abide in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It really is important to let not take away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to get there a fireworks today, we wanted to get out a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding with your own TV-adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now, just want to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I would not say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">This would have much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympiad winner.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "said them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">The Singen has accompanied her whole life: as young girls she was in the school choir, in the teacher's studies she finished the subject music, and today he sings the 78-year-old in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physical," describes me.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a test they feels out, merry and a total of living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Quite the next door, it is doing something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is equal to several perspectives, a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, the seniors can link social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because frequently, social and family structures in age up, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also been given Ursel Kipp in her choir: "let us speak and organize himself to the other, and one of each other - a choir is a very special shape of the collapse."</seg>
<seg id="11">Let's sing in the positive sense, Hacekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because they train seniors a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">But who calls his lungs as well as fast as fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of voice at the age, Singen is an optimum hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen was often a very special effect, Ursula Lenz says about the German labor community of the Seniors organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the previous generations, the common sin had a much higher job, it belonged to the everyday life, both in the school as well as in the leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is often common that the singing or hearing of songs in older people weaken many memories, often associated with positive deeds of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and particularly melodies, people deprived people in a long-time events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the head will also demands a special performance, Lenz the head.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, on their own voice and on a predefined rhythm, it is able to adjust the other hand-cognitive challenge - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, practising not only to concentrate on himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that departs through the singing in the choir, and Hacekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Themselves too show: if I'm long for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with the sing, there is so enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, it should not hesitate to have little talent to have little talent.</seg>
<seg id="28">Man does not sing alone - at 50 singers who hears, if there is a tone next?</seg>
<seg id="29">In Search of the appropriate offer, seniors are various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the announcement circle on a Seniortic Choir, you can easily close.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in a church in a church, can turn directly to the church or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors are also found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Who has no access to the internet, the family can ask friends or neighbours around the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing to sing a chorus, Hackler should be attached to a choir.</seg>
<seg id="36">Let the soul doeth well, and has something that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened up in the first half of the game with a feedback from the Middle East.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the trampolines of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are too, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro is constantly stable and inadequate, a shaving seasons between the competition and streaks.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is intended for swimmers to swimmers to swimmers to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not use the television set to read a newspaper or when talking about your neighbours in the Waeshop, without over Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman of white with dimples, could have been sent out of these known names to be sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and well-feeling TV advertising, if it would be a swimmer, Turner or even feeder.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not widely recognised: aerial Views, Archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swim and may rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I don't want to do arguments for my particular song, then let me leave the attention to the discreted charm of the trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines had already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had his debut, it was the last 16 years so bad that many who had asked, did not know that it is at all at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">It could also be regional Ignoranz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent to the competition, it never won a medal in the trampolines and won a athlete until 2012, who had made it up to the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are tend to share prices for men and Chinese and Canadian women to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Bell from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada are defend their gold medal from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolinjump has a certain outside wounded, partly because it sounds for the unlocked ear to a clownsschule as those of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am no expert, but only one experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the kartoonous quotations of his never to donate buffered - but also the Grazie of Turnover and diving, the two sports that combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish original trampoline, meaning as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victorious on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have to fall a number of falling movements (turning, yeast and saltos) before it landen at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to the official Olympiaprograph according to design, difficulty level and "flying time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Twenty-eight athletes of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are to compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to continue straight ahead to gold, faster, on the top and dron, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes and back at the bottom, and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They're not only the finishing line, or the starting line, but in the TV transmission also another cave: the world or the Olympiarctica.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted streches is Nobel, admired nsworth, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a spectators.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also that, what I myself to watch this games as a little tireless.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a retreat.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A reverse movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she princt, seemingly heavier like a astronaut, then down to bottom, then effortlessly again after the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vault into the Ferne, only the dreams, elegant uplift of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's like Zen in the competition at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will run the ends as a part of a afternoon of 2 days at 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who is likely to see in the general tumor.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness can only be reached by the attacking and the objectives of male athlete, according to The Wall Street Journal in front of the The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr. Dooley expected his return to air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation of protestants" in Ethiopia, Long A allies of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia, cast down on certain resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that only Protestant protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just merged?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid state of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months of protests against the government, the country and spread out more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week stormed thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer was inmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police officers were killed and killed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, more about the protests, which are probably from the last or early this year, show how security mute young people with bulls, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for Human Rights is now demanded an incoming study.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country and going to be even more difficult," told Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely together with Ethiopia in order to combat terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia Spain expanded in considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new pests in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally calm, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything like a model for democracy - human rights organisations ongoing the suppression by the government - the opposition was restricted to silence, whereby dissidents were effective to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or into prison, or killed in the desert of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you are subject, and these have no other options except for Protestant, it breaks out of," said Staryoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation of Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous certificates to cover everything from soil making up to dignity in terms of power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-reaching election last year, the radicating party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the voltages go along the border to Eritrea, a battle for this zackle, controversial line in June of hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst, that separatist like the Oromo-liberation front or the National Liberation front of the Ogades, which have been forced in recent years more or less, the turbulence could be armed and armed could be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the witnity after years of life in front of the surface is now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last few years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through the social media, as cheap smart phones were more frequently more frequently and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government shut up the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies, who hide them.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were gathered as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, who gives the two biggest ethics in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Egyptian prospering the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian High countries, in politics and economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But also that changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen," Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests found in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and the military, in the secret services, and the policy dominant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenith.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leaders, was up to his death on an unmistaken disease in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially obliged to perceive Early sign of unhappiness and Special Representative to work opponents and they are harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing at this basic crease," Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia of new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen as a relatively unexpected reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analytics say that he does not have confidence of the tiger controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more blood shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had lived on such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections, apparently, according to the data of analytics, apparently, was obliged by the government, and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razzies, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months, and this time of unrest is relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts in Ethiopia leaders of its visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new pecutives, as well as for their measurable progress in the poverty control.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not affect the intensive abnormalization of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, the protesting in Gondar, a amharic city, of Tigray guided stores and hatred against the tigray is still exercised in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests of the USA and other Western allies bring to a wide position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for merits flights about the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support the democracy, he will not want to break his allies in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin wall hike."</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was a cult culinary solidarity with the people," Jane Ziegelman said. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans, as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights, and are both food historian.</seg>

<seg id="9">Their latest cooperation, "an anpermanent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrated the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, scourbious imbite in the Flatiron District, which has already been in the business since the Börsencrash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, set a fresh cheese with olive oil, during Coe, 57, turkey with potato puree and vegetables.</seg>

<seg id="14">There were peanbread, liver loaf and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from a Zutphate and a somewhat cheap which access the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine how many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinners.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grinste.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must be put in the stomach as lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years ago the great depression was the table in a American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women boiled for male military workers and it was served fresh fried pastor for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans that they sent to the hungarian food during the first World War. "a Square Meal" draws the ways to its land, with which the country had to be moved, no longer the Schlaraffenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in the food for the Americans a central, encomed theme," the Coe, why he and his wife would like to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was the new budget: mysterious food, such as loaves and casserollen were re-nutritious than the wonderful type of casserolls as a miraculous way, the bricks debricks, because Köche unappetite ingredients could hide under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry sausage.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the centre of the American kitchen, was used to be a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Autonomous compositions have been arranged because a calorie-rich and nourishing satisfaction was preceded to taste or even healthy kitchenware.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her recherche for the book, which also includes recipes, we prepared a dish from this epoch, refried onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was no addition to the lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions fit not one another.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the laundry recipes.</seg>

<seg id="33">By winning recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "households of steels like creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>

<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the answer of the government to the hungry citizens, as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-Cake-Essen-Bring.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he praised the simple Iowa farm room of his kitchen, he spoke to the one millionenary man of the world to whom he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a fast-gold dining room and contributed a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was a glorious realm.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would have been committed to the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor would have been asked him to statuate with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the monsters of a housekeeper with no interest in taste of taste by Ms. Roosevelt, that the White House brought the boring meal in Washington but also one of the most controversial dinner. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of great depression, with eating, was rejected when the country came back on the legs.</seg>

<seg id="44">In writing, the couple announced the essings of bricks the eating habits of Ziegelmans-in-law-in-law - for example, how they could not throw food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of the conspirators of food," said Coe.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest tebrine is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare view.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaia usually come only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return an investigation into the ocean vessel of Sanna's research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is right with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie will only get up with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Marked by the Greenland expedition at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he gets on average 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it goes on, the five-metre animal accelerates at sx 2.6 km / h - and is with this top speed and as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this of loneliness seated lifestyle seems to be a sponsorter for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case of a Greenland expedition, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," published Alexander Scholarship of Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span that means a record record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the Evolutionsbiologist already suspect that Greenland is smoked.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, they live especially in the polar sea before the thin populations of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer the water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, immerse them in the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have to know as little as the lifestyle of the Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time-upid empire them when they took six animals in front of Svalbard six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">They still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another loved the pine bone of a young ice bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly it sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-meeres and looking for Kadaver that were out of higher water layers of downward.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as a top of the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeter measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, analyze them with the carbon-14 method the lens core of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyelids have already been replaced before the birth of Haie, which contained in the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear power dismissed major amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast with 220 centimetres, the third figure contained a low surplus of carbon-14 out of the nuclear phase, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland-haim had a normal carbon-14-amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, Carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimetre-long Grönlandhai was an old age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters could even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai females only got offspring then when they are longer than four metres, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, researchers were able to concordly the researchers at an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals came with 392 centimetres probably on the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years, Grönlandhaie with the digestion was obvious at least one half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">The world is likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methodaleme live especially in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The old record holder, a 211-year old Greenland, whose neck was caught up a 120-year-old harpoon gun, was captured on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures, often the organism of the living animals live in asparagrams.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you are later - and Altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep cool in cold water, the animals are often largely great.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through the animal warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous, and should be focused on it, as possible, as possible, as many offspring, the Evolutionsbiologist.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should aim to invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottland Callum Skinner hatched last night in the team of men in the Velodrom in Rio at the Rule, as the British team ended the title of London in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, who had made his landlord Sir Chris Hoy. the young and he made a legend when he stormed home a victory of favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocked victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">After returning the Trick, after it was only a modest sixth place in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the backdrop of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did just doing this time as a Hinds.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that tried to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man, when they stayed when they saw the potential in the scorn, which now unfolds now.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinders, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner in the qualification round a Olympics, but in the Standardronds victorious the New Zealand in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Dueling with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinds came back after its turn, but Kenny brought the team to the front and skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategic change made a large part of transformation, with the execution in a higher speed to allow him to slow down and secure it and mainly Skinner to allow a tempo.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as BBC expert from his position and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinds to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a good comparison of comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are set up the world champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the Triumph of 2012, on the side of Kennys and Hoys showed that he fell off after a weak start to the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He moved this statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">In such an oversight victory there was no problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">One said, "It feels with the whole GB flags on the Tribüne as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are so bad with so many worthers so bad that it was incredibly incredibly to win back at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven of 10 titles in Beijing as well as in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kennys it is in the area of realise that he repeated a win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, which was born on March 23, also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister (born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The beast of Hoy is equal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which begins today and will start over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this just for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">It can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels anything to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hinder said: "if he won two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the Knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medallists in the day, but there was another good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified to the fastest performance in four four-four Kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, won in London in 2012 at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, with the wiggins with safety in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He was yesterday with regard to the qualification before the qualification, when they were functioning to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate competition, the tomorrow is continued and finished, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team leaves his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and fetch a schar to medy.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London were shut down the expectations for Rio.</seg>
<seg id="46">It playes drama in the background, as the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April, amidst of sex and mobbinging, as well as the retirement as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees the first evening of the competition in Velodrome, it looks like this, the legendary reputation of GBS, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of aluminum melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - stand on the game, since the plant operators will be cancel the energy agreement, and therefore included all the delivery contracts, as the shipment energy companies shared.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is set up in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland stand on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs, direct and indirect damages could be at a closing time.</seg>

<seg id="11">AGL, which was delivered in Latrobe Valley with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley that three other owners will be announced.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is located in the majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL lies that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity by the processed cheese," divided the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL suggested that the treaties called "hedging transactions" will be able to enter into effect from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts concluded a 12 month cancellation period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL aims to contribute to the contracts in the business year 17," said the power supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL from the FY 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong dates for wholesale accounts prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">In its end, AGL declared that the treaties of contracts had already written in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the treaties, the "ability Alcoas... to ensure the melting or the power supply to the processed cheese."</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that there has been a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have come into effect from November this year, even if there is still a declaration, why it is not a declaration of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analytics due to the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of Portland processed cheese in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the Analytics at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 Megawatt and Tomago around 900 MW each year.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both plants should disappear from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [current market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as electricity he would not be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus and algorithms to discover those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once could have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously explained that the slow turn of Venus could be declared by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere could have gone up slowly.</seg>

<seg id="8">The planet presumably more dry regions as de Earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to harbor life and before faster disaporation.</seg>

<seg id="11">This is heated to the surface and produces rain, which causes a thick layer of clouds, which causes the surface of a large part of sunshine.</seg>

<seg id="13">The model brought a story of Venus, which is resembles the evolution, which is thought of planetary teachers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was likely to be inhabited, the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years --too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans have evaporated and its water vapor was burnt by the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmer from exploring malware, aims to provide company and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey of the malware, malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months at least once, some several times of attack a attack with expressors software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies have already had the target of an Ransomware revival.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid by the perpetrators required by the perpetrators to use the increased systems and data to be able to use data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialized their depressors software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack on attack network.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are successful there, the potentially too high-end soldering pay significantly higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we're currently observed an exhaustive fast evolution of pollutants," declares Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most malaria were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the Tattoo Stencils software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only, private users were the goal, but the change to the company had been exhausted in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware is working after a simple pattern: once on the computer's computer, seeks to search for unsuccessful files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">This files encrypted the Ransomware and extinguishing the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, the software will be presenting the demands of the expressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the access code to the files, the victim must have money - mostly in the form of cryptoung Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But when private use the personal photo database on the game, it goes to companies for sensible customer data or project databases, without which stands the production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is higher when a Ransomware decreases.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even the business activities had to break completely under a fall in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patient could be threatened by the loss of illness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say to the victims: do not pay, you pay only the problem," explains the Kleczynski</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 per cent of the companies have to pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject at standstill in the operation of perpetrators in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety awareness of F-Secure reduces the user to contact with the expressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain to their Opfern per chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, teach freely accessible support sites, or decrypt files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they are redeemed to payments from a few hundred thousand euros, the company must pay hard negotiate and five-digit Summen to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risoleic acid profits from the Ransomware revival, the hacker is always professional and share the work, explains security sexually Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person may write a pansomware about within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Likely it is likely that there are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their contaminant software in the form of a software construction kit to the actual Erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previously malware kit developed by malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in the scope of delivery, a adjustment feature, such as smaller configurations, appearance and fire can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressors are looking for another hacker to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you logging in one of the forums in the underfloor, buying the set of a crime and commissioned to install the software on as possible thanks to many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made by infectious computers.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, criminals carry out spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies that secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT Responsible in the Malwarebytes of responsibilities, using Ransomware using a file-back-ups and scannor software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrator already pursues new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is no sufficient threat to successful development, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data like about customer lists or price calations," explains Malwarebytes of Marcin Kleczynski</seg>
<seg id="41">That's the pollutants, depending on the type of data, more than earlier than earlier.</seg>
<seg id="42">They could also take the perpetrators in the future completely new goals in the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Precon demonstrate safety forscher, such as they could get associated with the Internet connected Thermostat.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the open circuit of a derart blocked heating so many victims can be worth a drop-money.</seg>

<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often common with a depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are distress.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whoever has a herniated disc for example, can be badly lie, wakes all two to three hours and should be pinned, on all everyday problems and greetings, there is white example.</seg>

<seg id="29">"only do not make a lunch sleep," says Fique.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the shortage, one walks into the bed in his normal period.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to electrodes the body is wearing a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera covers the sleeping on the ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="2">Pass the road from the east to the west, one comes along with places, refreshed children's garden and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the façade of a gray house, someone is ugly tougly. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it is already built: until 2017 is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy district," as the responsible property company Friedrichshain, are preferred during the last weeks, however, with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with no. 94: once was it occupied, the residents of the apartment has been occupied, however on the ground floor are still space-owned and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin's inner senator handle left several times for a hard ancestor of the police against the project, the area as "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team car from the place, locked parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers in the order of the unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided to have been illegally illegally, and a day later police and construction workers under the Jubel of sympathy and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer of summer, the street is peaceful: parents go with children, sitting on the office at the office in front of the houses in the sun, other entertaining themselves in late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects, there are a primary school and kindergardens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the chief of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez area since 1999, and Jana *, which has three children living here, especially from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects, they divide the worry before ascents and Gentiles.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a pine, who wish multicast polishing in front of vandalous lefts.</seg>
<seg id="16">The horror, the Berlin's inner senator and the police detect their neighbours, obviously not, obviously not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin actually was a traditional working volume, which also has to come to the rest of the city a lower average and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupied and the newborn residence are already long to the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former DDR, including almost the entire mainland street throughout the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mothers had been cleared by a regular road, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are part of the people living today, which they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly the magnets for tourists and electoral berliners from around the world: with them now share them from GDR and former HAUSBESETZER their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable for rent, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they can detect them by adding discs or freshly knitted facades which were discarded with color shorts.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was so often mentioned together with the words "linksautonome Violence" in this year.</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason that not all the neighbours know that as a problem may be, that they are not affected by the crime of criminality, as a body violation, statistics found almost entirely against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make nondamage, tends to make tensioning rather the newbuilds and recently renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years in a rental building.</seg>
<seg id="27">What is violent acts, she is an essential: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, that they should not be.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning car will give it directly in the Rigaer already no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is no decrimination point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more each other than what is different."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was also important that the people returned its streets: from the police, politics and media, which suddenly claimed responsibility for the neighborhood in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of Beinhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to take away from their superstructure in the former building, which the ancient residents are displaced.</seg>
<seg id="33">"this is the last of the property, which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good gorge," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can I absolutely not guartheis."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should I do if one never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is a frustration among all sides frustration, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">In favour of the bred, Kerstin Neugebauer became a little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever goes up, should be aware of that - just like someone who draws into a tree-quarter that can be badly damaged by noise.</seg>

<seg id="5">The social educational educational support is supporting the management of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She looks as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working from refugee aid, administration, authorities and who otherwise still communicated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer suggests that the honor has more than thankful that Deuschle is now that Deuschle now is, the eiving Wollmilion, which has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spottled as much rather on the wide range of care areas - meant as the administration wanted to write the site.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a eiving Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration is not her central area, weep Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially to the organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network business.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for approximately six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place within three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine Client that Annika Deuschle Ehren- and General Actors supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small issues, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new container in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been available since some time, apartments for the connection material, which have been approved.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection, the communes is responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate the refugees in their own or appropriate rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rental or renovation of this accommodation needs to bear the communes itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibilities changes to the Commratory of the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not everyone has to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time than very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto find the administration no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It didn't work so far, there was necessary to be on private apartments, as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, I must be chilled, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon you will be installed new container in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with flats it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, is Regine Client and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead-stay there are internships, training places, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and help activities for refugees and migrants, who must be folded or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help Hausmaster, non-profit-profit work - and motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work leads to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">He means, but not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day is a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Client.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are special offers like sport, contacts with homeerie and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and honorary volunteers.</seg>
