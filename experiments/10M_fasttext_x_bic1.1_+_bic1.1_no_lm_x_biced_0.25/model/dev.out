UN b@@ oss says that there is no military intelligence in Syria .
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution for the almost five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons , and poor for millions of people are wor@@ sens .
the UN Chef pro@@ ves again to support all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to develop and support Integ@@ rative negoti@@ ators to the final of a political solution .

8 transfer@@ ring values that show Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attemp@@ ted to brand@@ y him as flop brand .
others have done it as a jo@@ ke .
and some waiting for a break@@ through .
but it doesn &apos;t matter how some repub@@ lic@@ ans attemp@@ ts to draw Donald Tr@@ ump of the upper edges , in poll@@ s , it has not works ( still ) .
ten of the last eleven National surve@@ ys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some could continue to ask what it means for the chan@@ ces of nom@@ ination of real estate Mo@@ g@@ ul@@ s .
naturally , it is still early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that during that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given to the asc@@ ending Herman C@@ ain , none of which only won a state in the Nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would like to fight in a general election .
but exterior groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative Wirtschafts@@ gruppe Club for Gro@@ wth do recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s throughput and begin to break their dollar in order to over@@ throw him .
here are some current survey levels that suggest it suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary stage :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Belie@@ ve values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ da@@ cy in mid @-@ June , showed that only two of ten repub@@ lic@@ ants saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July there were 40 percent .
in early August , there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have negative opinion .
and these figures keep in the early States .
in I@@ owa , a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa demonstrated that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thir@@ ds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with dro@@ pl@@ ump as candidate .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans who would have been del@@ igh@@ ted either &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they were &quot; off@@ ended , &quot; when he had been the candidate .
only Ben Carson creates about same enthusi@@ asm as tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be exc@@ ited &quot; vs. 40 per cent , who say the same over Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in enthusi@@ asm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers say that she would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied , &quot; if any Bush , the Favor@@ it of Est@@ abl@@ ish@@ ments , the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans looks no problem as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump ref@@ unded to have crit@@ ically isolated for its Bom@@ bast@@ ian and reward points that 52 percent of the repub@@ lic@@ ans of Irish vot@@ ers believe that the property name Mo@@ gu@@ l is the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he didn &apos;t think the person@@ ality for an upper @-@ lack , according to qu@@ in@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent still think that he didn &apos;t have the person@@ ality to execute the office , and almost six out of 10 independence said that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / Post .
repub@@ lican vot@@ ers get the idea of the repub@@ lican vot@@ ers .
if they set their funds , Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers hold the dump for real .
if you &apos;re being asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C out of the last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that &apos;s a change since the time when four of ten finished their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers had not the clear h@@ emisph@@ ere in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ants , Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination , and only 28 % would win for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
non@@ eth@@ eless it shows that a wide variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers tr@@ um@@ ps also depic@@ ts a pl@@ um@@ b campaign .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered together for another candidates , Tr@@ ump per@@ forms almost everyone .
some experts agree that the frag@@ m@@ ented box is likely to contri@@ bute to Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used to more than a do@@ zen of other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ oth@@ et@@ ical head @-@ head @-@ head @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most of the other repub@@ lican candidates , enc@@ oding the majority of the majority .
he got 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ er and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who pro@@ poses it ?
Ben Carson would re@@ cover the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ oth@@ et@@ ical head @-@ head race .
a brief majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say that they have formed their mind .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only little more than half of the vot@@ ers who support tr@@ ump , they say that they have ordered their voices be fixed .
of course it can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
46 per cent said they open the door to change other candidates .
non@@ eth@@ eless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the most powerful competition at the moment of other outdoor se@@ iter , neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Carson , but vot@@ ers who have trained their mind is twice as often for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump on the subject of immig@@ ration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump has been inaugurated in his electoral blo@@ od@@ d two months ago , the installation of Mexico &quot; rap@@ ed &quot; was the immig@@ ration and re@@ focus on the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ art@@ y expression of tr@@ ump al@@ lied to H@@ isp@@ ano Americans are re@@ mot@@ ely damaged by the Repub@@ lican party .
but after the new ABC / Post survey conducted Monday six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that you agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immig@@ ration .
as long as the migration flows in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump is apparent that we have to do so .
the Fru@@ ity about the government makes up new high @-@ conditions .
by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben , in particular , about half of the support of Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers accounted for about half of the support of Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers .
six of 10 repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , she would like to make a political outdoor se@@ duc@@ ers as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 percent , and 21 percent of in@@ spir@@ acy . &quot;

&quot; Sy@@ lt is the offer of nature naturally @-@ limited , &quot; it is possible to the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows where special layers are one square meter most size .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ residence , one of the rate is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dre@@ am@@ start thanks to Müller and Go@@ ats
two @-@ fold Tor@@ p@@ hat in Pir@@ aeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy hits by Thomas Müller and the FC Bayern passed its way to a 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ acos Pir@@ aeus - and then ran it .
a so@@ vereign opening of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ cek had a dream starting with FC Bayern , inspired by Pir@@ aeus in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic Olympi@@ acos ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and j@@ aw ( 8 . ) des@@ erv@@ es with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th start to the series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ adi@@ ola wants to bring back the H@@ enk@@ el@@ p@@ ott to Munich .
Müller was named after his 28 hits in the Champions League at the Bavaria @-@ leadership of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left one of the World Champion from the world champion .
&quot; we will not estimate it , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 688 promised my fans and the Munich kept word .
they showed a concentrated and committed performance , without heating .
Pir@@ aeus gained his youngest six home games in the United Kingdom , including among those clubs like Manchester United , Trans@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund was a proud title here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bayern , in seven Europe Du@@ el@@ ists with Greek teams un@@ defeated , would not have to be the next vic@@ tim .
they went to fight out of work at their ob@@ vious efforts .
the attacks were headed by the turn of the Douglas on Link@@ sau@@ te Douglas Costa , who was sel@@ marked by the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i rarely .
Müller had left more happ@@ iness than his face from the right half @-@ field in the left upper edge of the left .
in the 67@@ th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best cas@@ ions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , when the Olympi@@ ah@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown was flying the head @-@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct delivery , the go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper was par@@ ked with the kne@@ e ( 35@@ th ) .
though the Bayern dominated the Prus@@ sian play , Pir@@ aeus was able to place Pir@@ aeus .
but Manuel New was al@@ lied on Tor@@ be@@ ter Manuel New
for example , when he had a shot of ide@@ ye over the L@@ atte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New Gu@@ ardi@@ ola cast@@ ed a quarter with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well .
Mario Gö@@ cek , after mus@@ cular problems back in the box , sat initially outside .
the World Cup was first given until the final standings after gradu@@ ating from &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who would like to make something different from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first switch , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to re@@ treat him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the connected Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Gö@@ cek had arrived late for Art@@ uro V@@ idal ( 76@@ . ) and made 13 minutes later it is clear to get by El@@ f@@ meter .
before the game , it was in the stadium to tie .
after a smaller group of partly susp@@ ect Bayern fans in their audience block evi@@ d@@ ently the trailer of host Pir@@ aeus in which the security forces attacked and embar@@ ked with dr@@ umm@@ ing against the Munich @-@ based market .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was injured during the stadium .

those who are smo@@ kes , lest only the lung , but also the teeth - that puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er long term study .
good news : the risk is rapidly drops rapidly .
smoking have a significantly increased risk that lose their teeth early .
this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ non @-@ smoking remains the risk of lose their teeth from pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly , in order to gain 2.@@ 5- up to 3.6 @-@ feet .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main cause for denti@@ als are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ation of g@@ ums , st@@ ressed the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , st@@ oning the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore go to the most common tooth fl@@ esh@@ ly inflamm@@ ation in smoke vent .
not clear , how far smoking remains ex@@ alted the risk for c@@ aries .
people who heard with the smoking they could reduce your risk within a short time , writing the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could last over ten years until the end@@ anger@@ ment return back to the level of non @-@ smoking , the first author Thomas Dietrich , of the English University of Birmingham .
people like to con@@ vin@@ ce humans , non @-@ smoking , explained in the H@@ einer Boeing of the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoke short@@ ened the life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for l@@ ungs and vessels and leads to our in@@ sights also to a good tim@@ ing health until high age .
over 20 per cent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of unemployment are affected , the DI@@ f@@ E divided by .
earlier studies have been pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth dec@@ ency .
the new long @-@ term study sub@@ du@@ ed the findings .

EU Commission suggest@@ s about TT@@ IP &apos;s new court in disp@@ ute
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current ar@@ bit@@ ration system to contri@@ bute to the scheduled Free Trade Agreement TT@@ IP .
the contro@@ versi@@ al private banking institutions for disp@@ utes between concerts and countries are to be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to more traditional courts in its function .
&quot; we want to build a system to trust the citizen , &quot; declared the Comm@@ ission@@ er to the European Comm@@ ission@@ er , Cecilia Mal@@ ström , on the show .
the Swe@@ din a@@ we@@ ed the proposal as a European negoti@@ ation position in the free trade talks with the United States .
the German Government has announced it .
by TT@@ IP , the world &apos;s biggest free trade zone around the world will arise about 800 million people .
plans to reform the current bit@@ ration procedure will see that the EU Member States and the United States choose independent judge for establishing a new investment fund .
they are to compens@@ ate in the EU , the US and third countries .
the first time is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to take against jud@@ g@@ ments .
so far , the process took part in the ar@@ bit@@ rator , a bub@@ bling against their jud@@ g@@ ments , there was no evidence .
in the discussion of the last months has become clear that the citizen of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of Fair@@ ness and justice did not trust , comm@@ ented Malm@@ ström .
long @-@ term , it wants to work on an international investment main course in its own account .
there may also disp@@ utes the disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and the EU countries .
the Invest@@ or State Ar@@ bit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) will be considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional ar@@ bit@@ ration cards are critic@@ ised by divi@@ ders than a type of parall@@ el@@ ties of the controls , scatter@@ ing the controls , national laws or decrease of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments of anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations , such as Camp@@ act pro@@ hib@@ ited the suggest@@ ions of the EU Commission as an in@@ adequate .
the free free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) was supposed to be agreed especially for the already issued free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
in contrast , the German economic State Secretary Matthias Sch@@ nig ( SPD ) signed the plans for his own progress .
the Commission has considered to consider reform of reform - Federal Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trading ministers in the spring .

the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a devast@@ ated series : everyone of the 50 US states should be listed in a result .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Quest@@ ion
since its election , Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s is expected to announce the prime minister of the Prime Minister for his election .
the new Labour Party Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n allegedly killed his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s deb@@ ates and David Cameron desc@@ ended for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is drawn up to the first of its six additional questions shortly after noon , whereby its achievement is likely to be checked out of the media and the Labour ME@@ P .
he asked &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could jump some meetings to make them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s , because it comes after his appointment to become a member of the shadow h@@ ops and after his speech at TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour chair , on Tuesday during a mem@@ orial to celebrate the 75@@ th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence in silence , cr@@ ushing the critic@@ ism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS , and stands in the centre of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them , attention to itself
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he said &quot; in respec@@ t@@ ful silence , &quot; he had been forgotten &quot; in respect of the Royal Air Force in the air slaugh@@ ter around England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme to sing the Labour chairman , the National h@@ ym@@ ne , &quot; ir@@ respective &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a do@@ zen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s top team , and it is called on dis@@ agreements with the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ month of the parliamentary party it was originally supported as a leader .
the political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences will be st@@ ack@@ able within the Labour &quot; and after Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s comments on the position of the European Union and the limit .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put the Labour changes to remove all the idea of a limit in total .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of work and speakers that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only subject to the government plans to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader , the David Cameron , ever since he has remained at T@@ ory Chef in the last decade alongside the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who had a different political commit@@ tees , says that he has received &quot; crowd Sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 institutions .
the Isl@@ ington North MP has said that it is tempor@@ arily the Prime Minister and that he is able to under@@ take both the impact of the Prime Minister , and that he is under@@ gone without serious problems such as poverty , in@@ equality , and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the sh@@ adows of economic minister it , is , when he is di@@ visible , for example , Mr. Cameron is on the road .
he has also brought the idea to the conversation that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the word , and that he was John Ber@@ ber , the speaker of the house , addressed to er@@ ect the problem .
when he was elected in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he was linked by politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le the@@ aters &quot; which often is often associated with the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but some years later he sp@@ ati@@ ated him that he had failed .
since it was sent to TV in 1990 , the qu@@ ests with the prime minister became prime minister of a leader and his leadership within the house and his position under his par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians , although cr@@ itic ar@@ gu@@ ed , it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require a further enlar@@ gement of the re@@ forms .

met@@ rics launches Bod@@ enst@@ än@@ tie &apos;s campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - rec@@ aster
met@@ rics is trying to protect the I@@ GA stores in front of a Al@@ di @-@ z@@ mar@@ sch in South Australia and Western Australia .
food retail@@ er metals has launched an Bod@@ enst@@ än@@ s campaign to def@@ end the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in the pre @-@ field of an 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA super@@ markets were preparing their relation@@ ships with local food suppliers and building the brand I@@ GA through Ma@@ instre@@ am @-@ marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events like Adelaide show .
I@@ GA @-@ De@@ aler and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ erst@@ eller Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA shops and shop , the remaining tickets for the South Australian football League will sell loy@@ alty customers .
it is expected to run met@@ a further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholesale dealer of food , alcohol and devices will pass through its annual Invest@@ ors strategy .
it is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA @-@ store which represent and higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
South Australia and Western Australia are listed in the South Australia and Western Australia with a much more stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia .
however , an@@ alyst@@ s believe that Al@@ di is roughly five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets , but with all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers can take away .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath gave testimony to Morgan Stan@@ ley that could lose the I@@ GA retail@@ er by $ 360 million per year and by the end of 2016 might lose a cost of $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
these pre@@ diction is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and gro@@ cery store and at the amounts of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s , met@@ a could cost around 13 million $ pre before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , met@@ rics loses global market shares in the eastern states , mainly by Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan discovered that I@@ GA race drivers are faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley decre@@ ases that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in food and gro@@ cery operations by 3.8 per cent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10,@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , joined a business in Melbourne , that met@@ rics will probably be van@@ ish within one decade .
Met@@ pay@@ lo@@ aked there to re@@ act the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of met@@ ros has been added to Mr Dou@@ glass with Mr Dou@@ glass .
I@@ GA@@ s market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s lifestyle and gro@@ cery stores about 1,200 I@@ GA retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflec@@ ting the operating training loss in relation to sales and mar@@ gins .
the wholesale dealer is however , and invest@@ ing more than 150 million dollars in order to improve the prices of Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths seeking to improve products every week , impro@@ ving fresh food products and better choice of private label food products .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Main Business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price custom@@ iz@@ ations and charging software will hope to charge and hope that the wholesale dealer will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian indoor tennis network Steve He@@ aly .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is des@@ erv@@ es rather praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and des@@ erv@@ es to view the President of the Australian tennis bat &quot; Steve He@@ aly rather praise as a critic@@ ism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the tal@@ ent Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special Ks , &quot; fell by the inf@@ am@@ ous med@@ itation of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an WA@@ WR@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the lim@@ el@@ ight .
in the Cinc@@ inn@@ ati in the Cinc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ ov@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be separated twice by the ar@@ bit@@ rator , Har@@ rison said : &quot; WA@@ WR@@ IN@@ KA would have to strike K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen as he sm@@ ote a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ ushing has failed a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ ov@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly &apos;s civil war .
the te@@ ens is currently in Glasgow , competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing that I was rather en@@ vy , is the fact that after my view was attracted a little about the disp@@ ute , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he had broken up a bat as he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who made a bat from fru@@ stration among themselves , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi is enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , truly , it really is in the US Open extremely good behavior , even among the quite prov@@ oc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think that he des@@ erv@@ es a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think that he was a little too tight .
he is a very enti@@ er 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never entered into the team and so on , he is absolutely har@@ sh , it &apos;s good in shape , it is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think it des@@ erv@@ es it after his own des@@ ires .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os on an important role plan to take into account on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part of his team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated in the competition , and not on all the contro@@ versi@@ al around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has done quickly the asc@@ en@@ sion , and he enjo@@ ys his cr@@ iti@@ veness , and he enjo@@ ys some worse fate . some time outside the r@@ amp , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the crew and it is best for the crew and it is the best for him .

C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that pris@@ onn@@ als involved in a race , the bar@@ bed wire @-@ fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .

election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Bern@@ ie Sand@@ ers
former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to take a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race at the nom@@ ination of national level , but Sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie Sand@@ ers wins their opposite bottom .
Clinton now has 47 percent of all democratic vot@@ ers ( 58 per cent before ) , while Sand@@ ers entered the second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not announced for the Pre@@ sidency , he will receive support of 15 percent of democratic vot@@ ers for the presidential elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the preliminary elections , the most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion will be able to support them .
but Clin@@ t &apos;s sub@@ contrac@@ tors are de@@ vised as one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton was lost to a number of dem@@ ographic groups , while Sand@@ ers scored a number of earnings .
Clinton holds a big jump in women and gro@@ oves , but these jum@@ ps have reduced .
your support in the men is clearly decl@@ ining , and sand@@ ers just returned with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons advantage of democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has become fully @-@ fle@@ dged , and they and sand@@ ers are now on the same height .
but Clinton still has a big lead over the older elec@@ tors .
last month , Clinton was Clinton &apos;s lead with two digit lead to the Liber@@ al , but Sand@@ ers added a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic election of the elections would say that they would support with an enthusi@@ asm of Clinton , when they were nominated by the party .
one quarter it would support with some prec@@ au@@ tion and support another 15 percent , they only support the candi@@ dat@@ in .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not sur@@ pris@@ ingly , that Clin@@ t &apos;s actual sub@@ contrac@@ tors are especially thr@@ illed from their enthusi@@ asm .
the views are stronger mixed with those , who are currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter it would be exc@@ ited .
in 48 percent of the democratic election of the elections that they will support Clinton with enthusi@@ asm , say less repub@@ lican vot@@ ers say that over their top @-@ party data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s sub@@ cut@@ ters are asked in a open question , why it is the most common answer to that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman &apos;s President is ( 13 per cent ) and that they are the best candidate for job ( 10 percent ) .
their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned in Clinton &apos;s Clinton .
the approval to dealing with the problems and the vot@@ ers are c@@ ited .
since the vice @-@ president will cast a potential for the pre@@ sidency in the f@@ ather@@ hood , 57 per cent of democratic vot@@ ers will see him in the race - though a third believe that he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers are asked if the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is in the top .
they would like to say that their second choice was far from Sand@@ ers by Clin@@ t tag .
deci@@ des himself to the nom@@ ination of the Dem@@ oc@@ rat , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead up before Sand@@ ers , from 20 points with be@@ es in the race down 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers will see Clinton &apos;s candi@@ da@@ in with the best chan@@ ces to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that has seen him than the &quot; one &quot; had risen , has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of that , what a candidates is more important , the Democratic vot@@ ers may di@@ alling over the vot@@ ers .
similarly as in the last month , there is not a consequ@@ ence of the Democratic candidate , or a potential candidate for these elec@@ tors , as in@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate , or potential Candi@@ dates are good results in some important characteristic tra@@ its , elec@@ tors of the party elections .
sur@@ vey@@ ance look Clinton , sand@@ ers and bi@@ ds as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong guid@@ ing qu@@ alities .
be@@ es cuts the best candidate at the best time with hon@@ esty , during the Sum@@ tons of strength .
thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers believe not that Clinton hon@@ est , and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say about Sand@@ ers ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion from him .
Democratic Party of the Pre@@ sidential elections are generally also Clinton , Sand@@ ers and Bi@@ den ide@@ olog@@ ically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , approximately a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers has no opinion of Sand@@ ers .
for questions to Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s personal email address and a server during the term of the Secretary of State , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers are dis@@ pleased with their declaration of the matter and say that there did not show their opinions altogether .
but it is another story of the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y did not dis@@ appear on their general opinions of Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion was det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated .
mostly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views from Clinton become worse .
even though Clinton used by the vot@@ ers of their party as hon@@ est and tru@@ sted , this is a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers : only 32 per cent they see as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled vot@@ ers do not comply with an hon@@ est and tru@@ sted person .
at the same time 55 percent of those entitled vot@@ ers do not see tr@@ ump as not hon@@ est , and not st@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and tro@@ dump received good notes in the lead .
of the six tested candidates , be@@ es , Carson and Bush , cho@@ ices the best in hon@@ esty .
a majority like Sand@@ ers are more hon@@ est@@ ly , but as with the Carson , many do not have any reviews of him .
the error rate for the sample yield of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers were 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson back@@ wards close behind Donald Tr@@ ump on land
Ben Carson is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times in close to Donald Tr@@ ump
in the two candidates , half of the support of vot@@ ers accounted for more than half of the vote in the new survey , and others lose dram@@ atically .
Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers continue to support tr@@ ump into large numbers ; the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted on Fox News in the last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
at the same period , the same amount is 6 % to 23 % .
the survey revealed that there are Carson in dem@@ ographic groups well and contrac@@ ted tr@@ ump into Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Govern@@ or John Kas@@ i , is be@@ aten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Govern@@ or Scott Walker , who is most fallen by 10 % support in the final month to now 2 % .
the former Florida governor , Je@@ b Bush , governor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida &apos;s Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place at 6 % .
the error margin during the sample of 376 people of Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was performed in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which has been published last week , shows that the Carson will rise to the poll@@ s - he land@@ ed at 19 % support with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post was also shown significantly in the Carson .
with a look at one in the last week , tr@@ unk@@ y found some side p@@ adding for former neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ geon , even after the ready for himself to use the for@@ um@@ ps faith in question .

five members of the br@@ otherhood can be loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
nearly two years after a student during a sch@@ ic@@ onic rit@@ ual result of a student communication in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ kl@@ agen will be submitted for five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ 16@@ 49 fr@@ action attack Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory statement in September 2013 brut@@ al and del@@ ayed his transportation to hospital , which contributed to his death to the police .
civil servants said that he had been loaded with ind@@ folded up with a 30 pound case filled with sand , and repeat@@ edly res@@ umed , during which he tried to go over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about he@@ ada@@ ches , and then un@@ condition@@ ally fell .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ 771 br@@ otherhood had not called the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g re@@ formed and was waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police worked .
however , they had time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , with his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the br@@ otherhood to collect advice , said police chef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide themselves , and set the welfare of the br@@ otherhood in principle over the importance of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chef .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died on his inju@@ ries in the next morning .
after a auto@@ p@@ si@@ ft report , Den@@ g was repeated with silent power inju@@ ries on the head , legs , and upper th@@ igh@@ s were added .
&quot; too many families were destroyed through the har@@ ic@@ ans of the br@@ otherhood . at least one student died from 1970 every year to the Sch@@ ik@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer to join the D@@ eng@@ s family .
br@@ other@@ ho@@ ods and their members must be drawn to settlement , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe receive a charge of murder of third Gr@@ ades for the first five members .
twenty @-@ two members of the br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are charged also for cont@@ em@@ ous attack and formation of a criminal club .
&quot; we are not only responsible for the involved people , but if there is an organization that is - officially or un@@ official - this will also go out this account , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College b@@ anned the br@@ otherhood , and the National Bru@@ der@@ ship has b@@ anned their affili@@ ation to the city group .
pass is going to pass when the F@@ ed increases its interest .
a interest bearing comes , and the hous@@ et@@ ches will be destroyed in re@@ fu@@ ck@@ ness , yiel@@ ds to the bonds , and the economy is due to a rec@@ ession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long to last and how long it will take .
particularly in particular , the history offers only small guidance on the drain .
a rec@@ ession came in only 11 months after the first interest of interest and lasted only 86 months .
the ag@@ gression of the Federal Reserve when lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in which the economy re@@ act as the economy and the financial investments .
thus , repe@@ ats of the US Central Bank had so b@@ ably emphas@@ ized that investors should not concentrate on increasing interest rates , but rather on the period that requires normal@@ ization for normal@@ ization .
in fact , several variables are played a role .
however , at the end , market participants could not assume that the whole exc@@ it@@ ement may possibly be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated due to a crash response .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed has been interpre@@ ted since the global financial crisis caused by some as a signal to the end of the &quot; budget funds , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Capital Economics , in a communication of customer .
in contrast , we do not expect to normal levels of US @-@ interest at normal heights , but still on a low level to cause an@@ is@@ mic shock that seem to fear many .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a historical trends based on historic trends that could re@@ act as some areas of the economy might :
as the market has seen in the last month , the withdraw@@ al of interest increases things for a while .
as soon as the increase hits , the influence is not so dram@@ atically .
&quot; there is a tend@@ ency that will be ch@@ oked 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may be reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank @-@ Analy@@ st in a recent study , which happen after interest increases in the feed .
more precisely , the market is generally up@@ ward in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest @-@ increase , fair@@ ly flat in the past six times ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) according to a recent analysis , Bob Doll , Chief plant Str@@ ate@@ es at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , was published in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ ds to appear at the ex@@ ual cycle , and return to decrease .
rec@@ ession are a fact of economic life , but interest rate enh@@ ances them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed has faced with some conditions that could not have gone before and have had a rec@@ ession .
not@@ ably , it is remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point of interest in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest increases , only twice the nominal GDP growth below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter 2015 was 3.6 percent , it is expected to expect that it is only 1.5 percent in the third quarter and forecast at Atlanta F@@ ed for the third quarter .
interest increases in a so frag@@ ile economic setting could be cr@@ un@@ able and throw the question on whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made a total of interest in the F@@ ed first year , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday .
while many str@@ ate@@ urs and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could be appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , there &apos;s only a prob@@ ability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all ex@@ alted cycles of 1950 had taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing the weak@@ ening of GDP and on pre @-@ rec@@ ession very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shadow , &quot; the report .
in contrast , this is a clear recovery of what the worst rec@@ ession in the observed phase was observed .
the current cycle is with far the longest which has under@@ gone the F@@ ed since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , as the market occurred in the market , and the patterns is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks , changing its strategic course .
the bond proce@@ eds to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle .
at the end of the cav@@ ity cycle , the bond proce@@ eds immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab think that the increase in interest rates will result in fact , yiel@@ ds var@@ ying between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a si@@ ege of the curve .
high interest rates often bring up in a such climate better earnings , even though we are still c@@ auti@@ ous , even higher income statement , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
as an interesting , Jones announced that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the views on str@@ ing@@ ere monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is flat , credit vol@@ t@@ ages has increased , and the flo@@ ods have risen - all features of the market if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in the big and entire company , that will roll the larger part of their business in the USA , including interest rates and local products will get more attractive .
mult@@ in@@ ational companies with high debt will be worse , as a number of dollars on the global market is more expensive and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality - &quot; shares were incl@@ ined to re@@ act three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; they said , Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ Anal@@ yst@@ s said in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet , company achieved an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yiel@@ ds and low volumes in their shares also met their counter@@ parts with lower quality ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts are a great problem .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest will be most los@@ ing , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games , consumers are also benef@@ itted by the increasing dollar .
savings could see gains through higher income , even if experts are of different opinion , as fast as it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says the member of the Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; dam &quot;
it ar@@ gu@@ ed that he is not to distingu@@ ish the increasingly of commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aim to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only knew The Br@@ its

BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns up to Classic FM , pro@@ claim@@ ing a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do anything of the privacy .
the Conserv@@ ative ME@@ P Andrew B@@ ingham has also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the publicly @-@ legal ra@@ dic@@ tive &quot; for@@ dum@@ me &quot; and increasingly no more of its commercial compet@@ itors to distingu@@ ish .
&quot; Radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; for@@ st@@ up@@ id . &quot; but it seems to be transformed to Classic FM . &quot; he said .
he has also been targeted at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples , in which you are actually only the im@@ it@@ ful , which is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ Director General showed the predecess@@ ors back and arg@@ um@@ ented that BBC Radio 3 is comm@@ ented on the public pro@@ mp@@ its when it comes to the public music and re@@ conn@@ aissance team .
what about radio 3 ler@@ ne I will learn about classic music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music , that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , new music to find and new works on order , I have also really kept for important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that har@@ der hard to involved in hard to eng@@ age the audience , as it did this in the past , because the British are less than classic music .
radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the Commission for the selection of culture , media and sport , under fire , to re@@ cover the commercial Riv@@ als on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins Publ@@ ish the Voice to the musical tal@@ ent show of BBC , who was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated $ 22 million cost .
do you see why this program is often disc@@ usses , because it &apos;s not original , and not especially stri@@ king ?
Lord Hall showed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - &quot; was produced on a special BBC film .
he added , he wishes that the company &quot; find a hit from our homemade st@@ all , &quot; if there is the next time a entertainment series .
however , ref@@ uses to finish the order from the voice of The Voice in the future or add money of the contacts for other non @-@ entertainment formats .
sales revenue in August at the s@@ lowest and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales enh@@ ances three years ago through the use of mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday will bra@@ ked the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping basket has gro@@ om@@ ed , and many of the main shopping streets have turned into action .
but experts say that there are now evidence that the online sales stag@@ n@@ ated after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that online sales have been stag@@ n@@ ating if new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for years of years and until 2000 , then , in the course of time , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Ed@@ itors of the IM@@ RG @-@ sale is the Guardian .
he explained that online sales grew three years ago when bu@@ yers began to deal with their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online shopping and they could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa .
but now we p@@ end@@ le itself , and we may possibly see that the growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenom@@ enon which was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the abandoned sales .
experts believe that bu@@ yers will hold their purch@@ ases in front of this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , the average number of bu@@ yers to make their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe that Black Friday presented the bu@@ yer &apos;s bu@@ yers for bar@@ gain , bu@@ yers of it could be to make purch@@ ases .
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found out that of £ 5 issues a little bit more than £ 1 .
in some products such as television and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of all purch@@ ases now be carried out via Web @-@ Shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men &apos;s clothing and shoes were online rather than in the aquarium .

function of A@@ i / DO@@ B due to un@@ faith@@ fulness
on Wednesday , the national court Kl@@ agen@@ furt have to respon@@ d two officials from the Austrian Vol@@ leyball Joint A@@ i / DO@@ B due to un@@ faith@@ fulness and task forces .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them was also charged with counter@@ part .
he was acqu@@ itted on this court in May .
the current trial was ad@@ journ@@ ed .
according to the Att@@ orney Robert Ri@@ ffel , Robert Ri@@ ffel had a cryst@@ alline that the accused were le@@ ased during the years 2006 to 2011 that they were allowed to dis@@ pon@@ ed their features in their functions .
the damage reaches the damage with 400.000 euros .
the Sports functional are also charged with a financial crisis .
this factor was to leave the ch@@ air@@ woman of the judge , judge Michael Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it meant to be a later date .
the defence case of un@@ faith@@ fulness laid the defence , that the association was not taken at any time .
the sports function@@ ally had only been we@@ aken and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and had invested much time and money invested in the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va was around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : we conduct the Club on or un@@ lock them ? , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread so@@ rely large operation of the financial sector .
he decided to join his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants to take these tasks .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot cash for money , as security at the bank &quot; security , &quot; he said during the arrest .
agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , no deb@@ ts must be done .
in addition , be agreed upon by the financial and success - the payment of the charges have been imposed by 1991 .
hence , one part of the conc@@ ern damage is only years later , namely from 2003 , when an increase has been on the account , paid out .
as a result , the l@@ ump sum and not detailed comments explained , explained the ex @-@ Ob@@ mann as soon as possible .
the accounts and savings administ@@ ered the two accused , accused the second accused .
why the payments of the association was not in detail in detail , the judge .
the association did not interest in detail for the financial interest , important is only the debt of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the organisation of the organisation of the Am@@ t@@ sm@@ ite .

this securities account ran to the name of the second accused , and was not familiar with the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; it wanted to know the judge .
to in@@ sist@@ ed , the asking for a long time .
then he thought that he had believed that this is the best for the club .
if any happened to it , no man would have recovered anything from this money , the pro@@ secutor &apos;s so@@ lic@@ itor in the room .

time to the decision on interest rates for the US emergency
the world is observed when the US not@@ ation stay on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to meet the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade , the interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were question@@ ed by Reuters , found that a little more than half , which will be the last week , now think that the F@@ ed will still spend some longer , and the interest rates will be on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent .
it is an historic event , because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest rate to N@@ ULL .
for the first time we appro@@ aches us a situation , in which a large central bank is leaving the zero resource , leaving a process of normal@@ ization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel V@@ bide , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is added on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate a low inflation .
however , F@@ ed cannot ign@@ ore the less ro@@ sive out@@ look into global conditions .
it war@@ ns the markets to introduce themselves , but the signs indicate that the chan@@ ces are doing good to such a step .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday .

Luke Sh@@ aw from Manchester United can not play in monthly fr@@ action
LUKE Sh@@ aw suffered from Manchester in the Champions League @-@ defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , one double correction of his right legs .
while the left stri@@ king def@@ ending the left and ended him for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ aal cannot place the hope that Sh@@ aw can be back in this season .
the viol@@ ation was created by a promising attack of Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in 15th Minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sh@@ aw was built in the PS@@ V field .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and took oxygen before it was brought into the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double bass Cor@@ rection and lies in the hospital . &quot;
it will be re@@ located tomorrow , or maybe one day later , in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United in 18 , it &apos;s very difficult and then playing fantastic , and then it happens .
in the cabin , he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am no doctor but if you have double fac@@ tions , then lasts for six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy , a red card and a suspension of a sho@@ res .
Nicola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the ar@@ bit@@ rator , has not pen@@ alised the Mexican .
van G@@ aal susp@@ ected that the Italian ar@@ bit@@ rator had failed .
you can ass@@ ess for yourself if I say that a mo@@ f@@ meter and a red card were random@@ ly due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on Sh@@ ared account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe what I am , my way to recovery starts , I will come back again . &quot;
survey : Manchester United opens the loss of Luke Sh@@ aw at the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championships in France , the European Championship in France has an additional inc@@ enti@@ ve to get up to the coming June .
Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad inj@@ ury . &quot;
if a player gets to the square with this kind of inj@@ ury , all very sad about this .
it &apos;s never the inten@@ tion to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg formation as Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland @-@ Team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard because it wasn &apos;t his inten@@ tion to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad inj@@ ury , that is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing that I could see , was the ball that was in a different direction on the way that he saw &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I was not able to see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it fe@@ els like it can be so hard .
I feel really bad . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ chen was also brought into the hospital after a F@@ oul@@ dering game by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that all parents may learn soon : if your child love one book , it will not take long until you know almost all of them .
it is because you might be David Cameron .
when he was asked by a providers of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , decided to announce the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 Minister @-@ President of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron trig@@ gered in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s and goes on : &quot; fun , moving , creative , and with powerful em@@ bass@@ y , since it seems to give to my children , because it seems to give a picture or an em@@ bass@@ y that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent Clau@@ se , where Cameron supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , ren@@ dered a content of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the fair@@ ly short text message .
&quot; in the pl@@ um@@ ber@@ ed town of Th@@ rough @-@ Ville , where all the nature is gone , and even the air named after Ted , the heart of Au@@ drey , whose name was reading , reading a real tree that was written by Theodor Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el and died in 1991 , however unknown .
as if it was not yet condemned : the Cameron appears to be presented by Cameron &apos;s text , which is presented at the website of Internet Movie Datab@@ ase , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commod@@ ity , tru@@ ff@@ led a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ drey , to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he appears to be a pr@@ ag@@ matic father , it seems that Cameron appears the action of the book as little ent@@ ity . here is an un@@ named boy , as the local environment through the yellow och@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , cat@@ ar@@ r@@ ush beings , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; was devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task was resol@@ ved on a hel@@ per team who did not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times after another child .
a Down@@ ing Street Spe@@ akers told that the text is probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s constitu@@ encies .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered from Cam@@ er@@ ons employees but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam LY@@ th was definitely threatened by the excl@@ usion of England , but it is still difficult .
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task is a difficult task , but when one has chosen the k@@ ader , the England for the tour , see a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series , not on my map .
I won &apos;t close a reverse victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks site is probably less experienced as the years ago , but there are good spin @-@ player in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strongly ; they will not wear a you@@ ths of 2012 , only a jug@@ end positive setting .
featuring the ball , Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid herself , even when he is an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
in this article , Adam Ly@@ th elim@@ inated out of the England test cad@@ res and was replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to dis@@ allow Adam LY@@ th , of course , is of course to analy@@ ze me as his leader in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult for me .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but har@@ sh reality is that cri@@ p@@ ies are align@@ ed to results .
there were no quest@@ ionn@@ aire at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said these things - players are their own best cho@@ ices .
long ago man had extended the course of ly@@ th , but he had the control of his own dest@@ iny .
if he hop@@ efully out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss give his attitude , even though he had not so good performance , and sur@@ prised me not ; he is primarily a team @-@ man .
the question how much time a test specimen is to set up his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th won seven chan@@ ces - like Sam Rob@@ son had received nine responded to Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on received the chance to play home and play .
the only advantage that it can be noticed that England first sat down in the Caribbean at first - as ly@@ th in the Caribbean , but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es come in , and he is a b@@ ats@@ man that I have high on .
he is a X @-@ factor @-@ cri@@ p@@ ups that we have seen at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season , when he set in 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
it must be at least the same chan@@ ces of opportunities such as those obtained from the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to run Mo@@ een next Cook , giving an extra @-@ Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and get four Qu@@ icks , I &apos;m looking for , and I don &apos;t have anything against it .
I do not see why a b@@ ats@@ man cannot hit there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil / cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps does not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined as a op@@ ener in 2001 .
he is creating three hundred round and did not look back .
Zaf@@ ira Ans@@ ari comes back in the cas@@ cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him , he im@@ pressed me as young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spots that have lifted up their hands and coach have decided to youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England , England has made a few cl@@ ue completion of the training .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ a awar@@ ding the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , an advis@@ or for the test games could be a master@@ place .
it is one of the n@@ ett@@ est Ker@@ le of the game who will bring an abund@@ ance of experience , since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes on the white ball stage in the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela has he pro@@ spects for which we can benefit .
sometimes new votes can bring in the dressing cab@@ ine with fresh wind , even if the news in line with the previously sent .
coll@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot has got a similar break against Australia and I was no problem with that .
some will not agree to agree , but co@@ aches and team use do not determine the ti@@ met@@ able .
and you need to remember that as with the players dep@@ end on results of the results .
such decisions are not easily hit .
Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ Lager ( Bre@@ x@@ it = out@@ sour@@ ced Great Britain from the EU ) might be on ad@@ mitt@@ edly if the economy has been set up into a fleet in 2017 .
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ issued new negoti@@ ated strategy to keep the UK in the EU is with every day de@@ eper in difficulties , even without the choice of the gen@@ ious Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , that go through Europe on Tuesday .
fore@@ ign@@ ers also have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Ni@@ gel Far@@ es .
a European diplom@@ ats and said again , that some states , as deep spread in different cr@@ ises , as the EU is now and not always created by their own fault , Great Britain itself created agenda with a pal@@ ate conc@@ essions and inter@@ ference promot@@ ions that they are not satisfied , satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C chose at its annual general meeting that it is not able to end@@ ang@@ ered the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister at the summit or bil@@ ateral meetings in foreign capital cities , make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for re@@ forms .
it is always about me .
my European friend who wishes to the outside of the UK in the interior of the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; L@@ ass is not giving us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can explore the more short @-@ term minister and civil servants in some major cities until the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
in Germany , German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been doing this way for 10 years before it looks good for them as they ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande looks back to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ aded power .
Poland , possibly soon a nation@@ alist government , Spain has probably left a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that it will be able to rest a leg to prevent Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , their energy should not want to prevent main@@ land from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to have the most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tend@@ encies .
hence , perhaps some such ministers are kind@@ ly anticip@@ ate useful notes , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while the UK @-@ war campaign in 2017 to acceler@@ ate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , con@@ j@@ ection to my bo@@ y@@ friend .
&quot; the New Treat@@ ise was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain won &apos;t won any of the new business . &quot;
Europeans know as r@@ all@@ ically the Fle@@ et Street to their cost , and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics lie the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired speakers in 1975 , that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can remember as weak in Boris Johnson who had the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opp@@ ort@@ un@@ ks , who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Straight P@@ act &quot; in Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his simp@@ licity , Ed Mil@@ i@@ band who had been his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fe@@ aring ch@@ icks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers recru@@ it@@ ment and pseud@@ o non @-@ ins@@ ure , most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air ali@@ ke about her , but set sure that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , you get better ban@@ anas to get him down instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air itself , being rejected the principle of refer@@ ring to the European Parliament , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the EU &apos;s constitution , which subsequently was rejected by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 .
the press has never forget him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly appearance on Monday at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he doesn &apos;t have time more for me in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yc@@ ott Mur@@ ten strategy of the 80 &apos;s years to repeat , a mistake and today .
it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left the Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position to Europe is - I pres@@ sions it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blind tend@@ ency and the wild@@ life fill@@ ets of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say well to that .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and TV this week said , &quot; not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Ern@@ aming of pro@@ vo@@ z@@ able John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ atten@@ Chancellor was a poor idea .
it still remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father trad@@ ed in television , loy@@ al against his Labour Cab@@ inet To be too far too far and lose his cabin job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but too , in order to stay &quot; under all circumstances , &quot; Benn@@ ington said , &quot; what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what about Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said about his compet@@ itors and members after all reports on Monday evening .
what is always the tou@@ ch@@ ant Bot@@ tom @-@ Up Image of Cor@@ by@@ n - think that he even has touched me - News Dis@@ cipl@@ ine remains important in the Age of TV around the clock , and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding centre of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it &apos;s correct , Cameron doesn &apos;t give a free ticket for Europe who allowed him to keep L@@ abo@@ urs support in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins always think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s fundamental majority to the EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Siege , its anti @-@ capit@@ alist debate - is not just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under the left dis@@ sidents who is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .

P@@ he published the &quot; Prin@@ ted Report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; extensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the load capacity of the data , and demonstrated the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
in the Lanc@@ et recent month , a leading article in the Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; excep@@ tionally narrow base &quot; laid on the P@@ it its most important concl@@ usions .
another researchers write to BM@@ J , and were asked if the claims &quot; was laid on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European public relations health at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Ep@@ idem@@ i@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies is based on the evidence of effic@@ acy . &quot;
they said to the public that the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harm@@ ful , they are based on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling .
in fact , this statement from a single meeting of 12 people , which were sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ critical criteria ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ based products ; the meeting of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ized in a research report .
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a spon@@ sor of the meeting was a company called euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously granted by British American Tob@@ acco Regulation ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BAT to the public health in an sustainability report , as they said .
one of the 12 participants stated on the meeting used by an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing which he received after reports before the tab@@ ac@@ company Philip Morris International , added it .
the reasons for the selection of members of the committee are not supplied , but include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , of which some of them also indicate a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting also took part in the tobacco management of P@@ he .
the Group &apos;s research contri@@ bute determin@@ es that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , from McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however no these connections are discussed or restri@@ ctions in the P@@ he report .
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he that &quot; there are no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being in P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted before .
he said : &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably harm@@ ful as smoking . &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ong bu@@ cher dies on his Su@@ cht .
all evidence suggest@@ s that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared with regard to the long time , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term imp@@ lications .
p@@ he has the clear oblig@@ ation to the Information of the public about what the evidence is occupied and what is not what is much more public conf@@ usion about the relative d@@ ang@@ ers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die each year in a si@@ ck@@ ness with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National health@@ care system two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear approach of current evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes is not without risk , but only a fr@@ action of dam@@ aging that caused by the smoking , we meet our national j@@ uris@@ diction .
BBC should give East@@ En@@ ders , former b@@ oss of Channel 4
the former Ch@@ air@@ woman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should qu@@ it , programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that the commercial Riv@@ als would be present to their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson told that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs not to be sent by other UK broadcast .
he critic@@ ised the BBC as well to announce public legal programs that are likely to be seen from a smaller audience to be challeng@@ ed in hard @-@ cont@@ ested time window against the most popular shows in their Riv@@ als and Sen@@ ales as B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company will do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 , with the BBC in contact .
&quot; I have trouble with the idea that BBC Program is available on order or send it clearly inspired by un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee under the study on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio prices , what I keep medium or long term not for a good idea , you should make his production at least on programs that others do not make .
you send the voice to a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody should show this is a jo@@ ke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is of course sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why an exc@@ res@@ sive control programs will be fin@@ anced , but it could be fin@@ anced without the sub@@ si@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , yet comp@@ uted both own production .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arms .
I &apos;m trying to see how this public TV is to be public .
I don &apos;t think that the BBC would reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a busin@@ ess@@ man for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 managed to work on the hunt for the assessment of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will return to the BBC as leader of the BBC , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart @-@ presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell as East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal n@@ ical programs &quot; should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they can &apos;t re@@ ate their tasks , and they can argue that when they work on their apparent cap mission to just@@ ification 4 billion £ round charge , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these above programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see .
on the round@@ trip , Johnson told the Committee : &quot; I encour@@ age you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions which can be obtained from the best value .
of course , we think all that you have a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who think for the £ 150 a lot of money is , ask me whether it is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ and and Channel 5 b@@ oss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC will exam@@ ine their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to inform them to form and maintain . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it be 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % at radio - and it should change to the public @-@ law@@ ful TV channels in Australia and Canada , an example , to change it in &quot; adv@@ ise , glori@@ fied and chat . &quot;
for the question of partners , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ ens to make all these online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; may control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how Nem@@ esis will change the direction in the moment , they will be broad@@ cast@@ ed with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have cultiv@@ ated dig@@ ms with gen@@ et@@ ically modified nerv@@ es that can be controlled by breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ esis change the direction in the moment , in which they are with sound impul@@ ses , which have to be heard for the human hearing too high frequencies which are to be exposed to .

further to this topic : researchers read and write Hir@@ n@@ activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , when ultr@@ as@@ ound is used to activ@@ ate a series of cer@@ ebr@@ al , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .

the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ ound system operate on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the mem@@ bran@@ es of some of the mer@@ cen@@ aries .
the sound waves are on the opening of this icon , and activ@@ ate the cells in which they are al@@ located , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ esis , Chal@@ as@@ ani turn@@ eth the wor@@ ms so that some of its mot@@ one@@ age TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ onic channels .
when it turns up@@ side of the variable cre@@ atures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ controller and transferred to wor@@ ms , where they changed the changed engine ones .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a pione@@ ering tool , the scientists facil@@ it@@ ated , ne@@ ur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and off .
but Chal@@ de@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics may have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , that must be sent from optical fibre to the desired amount in the brain , low frequency @-@ sensitivity of tissue may be passing un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent into the brain from top at the sk@@ ull .

eight Golden Reg@@ ul@@ tions for Life in Student Residence
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith to Ber@@ ets and mor@@ al Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the att@@ acking smile , which I have , and to the numerous , lang@@ at@@ ly compl@@ aints about others .
most of what I have learned , can dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the withdraw@@ al in student halls is from slightly nerv@@ ous to completely exhau@@ st@@ ive .
it is loos@@ ing to flu@@ ble : people tell wh@@ ence you &apos;re perc@@ ei@@ ving whether or where you have said the Sabbath year , and why you will not love story , because in Ernst , boys , it &apos;s only a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe out through .
and help others to do the same - Make questions and show any interest .
it stri@@ ve the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those who would not speak with which you would not speak , even if your lashes are in fire and fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people do .
the rooms of people are often walking in be@@ verage recipes , film @-@ night venues and commun@@ al meeting , but they are also the places where people are put on and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
there@@ from : remember to start accept@@ ing a relationship with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ug@@ ized received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room B@@ umm@@ el @-@ culture that can result friendly and soci@@ ally @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for anyone who tried to re@@ cover themselves .
nothing at the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away , that I have consumed the energy for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comm@@ il@@ it@@ ones of soci@@ al@@ izing is exhau@@ sted - and send an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ prop@@ os anch@@ ors : do it .
a guy in my student dormitories had the idea that a completely closed door was an invitation .
he looked some things .
friendship close by baking .
as you start the university on the cli@@ max of the back @-@ Man@@ ia , the clo@@ ister along the doors of humans , to make less strange when the welcome of the 1950 @-@ year @-@ years &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have something cr@@ ack . now , and now I smile , if I don &apos;t give you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade le@@ ak paintings are a good way to close friends .
their co @-@ inhabitants are ob@@ li@@ ged to maintain and will be associ@@ ate with a le@@ ak surprise at the end .
of course , it depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker .
bad mis@@ o cl@@ ump with flour , sugar and fat helps to make it sleeping .
food to ste@@ al , is a common crime in student halls .
of course , the cl@@ aws of h@@ ens is a th@@ ie@@ ves , but it is the breath of a drops of Mil@@ king for your tea ?
check that with the da@@ iry owner .
the chan@@ ces are good to serve themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if a man ste@@ als your stuff , so you have perf@@ umed my comp@@ as@@ sion - but try to add more balanced than my fellow worker , who added her milk into milk to get th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they should make no noise , the people from sleep , or of work .
it is not only thing to be a constant person , but that you belong to people in the true sense of the saying that are sitting in the glass .
a girl on my fl@@ ur , their neigh@@ bo@@ urs , whether they make something very quiet , watch out the Drum &amp; Bass , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and it had a test every morning .
they re@@ acted to music with a loud music .
when she ulti@@ mat@@ ely dropped by 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neigh@@ b@@ ors still left two hours before leaving their own music , shut up their door and stood at their three hour ex@@ am .
if it would be no romantic , if your future would be to enter into the same student residence ?
it would not be de@@ eply im@@ pressed by what you think a fellow worker for your future , join them again , and then you will have to see and experience every day , and perhaps how to bring together all common friends ?
of course , the heart is his own way - but when a hot co @-@ resident is definitely not your future wife , try to t@@ end your su@@ dden a little bit sens@@ es .
at the very moment , in which you notice that som@@ eb@@ ody finds his key in his not closed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ bb@@ ing f@@ einer when it seems .
a good bar@@ k is funny , but it will only takes eye views , until he will become a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share through hi@@ des a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but you never leave someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
tigh@@ ten your door , and put your keys into a glass of water , which you will then put into the freezer - but you don &apos;t stri@@ ve their owners at the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , all@@ ot@@ ent , rum@@ ors
the real estate contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds a small town@@ houses for people who have not much money .
so for refugees - but even as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother @-@ educ@@ ating mother and the rum@@ ors needs . &quot;
&quot; I show how to buy cheap today and assem@@ ble it today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees will come on the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly a che@@ er@@ ful living room can be created : it builds in a project of Rei@@ h@@ enh@@ ances for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will come to the Housing Market .
what solution can you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass@@ ages of containers in containers or g@@ ym@@ s has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
in the beginning of the refugee camp we need to have sufficient living room in the next decade .
a completely ban@@ que , three @-@ storey terrac@@ ed house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terrac@@ ed house takes place on the least place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
that is different , if you are subject to people in living blocks .
each of the six homes , which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three apartments for each of four asylum .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a dining room .
it may be that many refugees will say , there will be peace , I go back .
then , the houses can easily be converted back to the particular requirements .
how high are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without land .
this is over@@ looked .
building takes six months .
that is fair .
did the construction regulations are comp@@ lic@@ ated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I &apos;m interested in my project correct .
especially comp@@ lic@@ ated , it always makes the above Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ ite special construction and the camping @-@ placement .
gr@@ us@@ el .
it is still subject to anyone who creates three apartments in a terrac@@ ed house , needs at least three places .
only in the cities big is the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants re@@ act to their terrac@@ ed project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have dropped to me luxury boats for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not wrong .
but don &apos;t miss the compet@@ ence for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true : indeed , we had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but were luxury apartments that can &apos;t work with one more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but likewise the mother @-@ educ@@ t or the rum@@ ors alone too .
I show how to buy it today and how to build it today .
therefore it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by using the setting app , select &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; software update . &quot;
if ready is ready , you can download the telephone option to download and then .
some are curi@@ ous after installation , as they get an error message , which shows that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to enh@@ ance the problem , users is recommended to wait for either to get up to the storm , or trying to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself will take you through the rest of the trial .
this may possibly represent the extinc@@ tion of apps to make place - but Apple has done this to do so if you want a special tool to install apps , and then re @-@ install what the process is finished .
it is wor@@ th@@ while to ensure that your cell phone is up@@ loaded , or is located close to a charge , so the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not make sure the update will be continued because the phone may eventually burn up a way , so that this might result in a break@@ down of updates .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of Fel@@ ste@@ als and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ eres .
also , as a result of the joint German citi@@ zen@@ ship Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promotion U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ artz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places on the country of doctors - As@@ endorf , however , luck : Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ als on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ers go into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is his successor to his successor to the next few months .
after a re@@ organisation , Müller delivered the office on October 12 , till then he invested € 3@@ 10000 in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Marc@@ ell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was symp@@ ath@@ y for the first sight when Frank Müller and his wife appointed Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ alone , which currently completed her experts of several students in the hospital , who wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage seemed good in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laugh@@ s .
&quot; as far as it was , I just call it to call . &quot;
a couple of Müller pleased the idea to operate their own practice in the future of As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to learn the families over the years and accompanied them . &quot;
as advantage , he see also to be his own b@@ oss soon .
and so the gar@@ bage tax was bought up the house with practice .
they are still living in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
here is the double family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed the stations in several medical practices , as well as in hosp@@ itals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .
he currently works as an ophthalm@@ ologist in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was ordered to the leading medical specialist in the district of Die@@ ph@@ olz and is dedicated to volunteers in the DRC @-@ preparation Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September , the practice was prepared for the new b@@ oss .
during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen working as a house @-@ di@@ atri@@ cian , his gen@@ era has joined in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) special@@ izing in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both intern@@ ists , would like to leave themselves as a hous@@ et@@ aker .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore down , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms will look like .
we will offer more compact se@@ as@@ ound analysis and long @-@ term and loads -@@ EK@@ GS and need a microphone room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 euros will receive the tr@@ ash in the framework of a pre@@ sidency programme by the local district ( 25,000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; it shows how proud and happy we are that practice is continued , &quot; st@@ ressed the community of Sam@@ pling Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2,000 patients are coming to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ es every quarter in practice Fel@@ ste@@ als , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is still another house ar@@ zt@@ pra@@ xis .
a positive effect of the pract@@ ition@@ ist tak@@ e@@ over by Frank Müller : the pharmacy near Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stood in As@@ endorf .
if no successor could have been found , it would have gone too .
but those who tr@@ ash his supp@@ er can still look into tru@@ sted faces : takes over seven medical experts and det@@ erg@@ ing the fields of fields .
with their f@@ are@@ well died in As@@ endorf , a era , after all , the medical workers lived there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; the prim@@ ers re@@ members rock@@ y .
a little W@@ eh@@ mut was pres@@ ently reading it after the long time .
but we still live in Hoh@@ en@@ mo@@ or and are many patients still see , &quot; says the interests .
your husband is compl@@ em@@ entary : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I have p@@ pressed me before Gar@@ dening , now that may be different . &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; the head of the border controls &quot; Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , &quot; with the border of the border .
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel with this .
according to what is clear that everyone who wants to provide an asylum application , this is also &quot; of course . &quot;
the supply and security of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
clearly , however , &quot; that it needs to be significant signals , &quot; said the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
people will need to accept that we do not accept the limit@@ less migration flows , even on the Austro @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering the cor@@ ridor &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia .
in addition , the Croatian Government had previously informed that Slovenia wanted to go on for refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and there are also cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
but this was the Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors was &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather give the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - inten@@ sively .
the border with Croatia is already extremely strong in the out@@ line of the Sch@@ engen area .
like the Council of Minist@@ ers , Sloven@@ ian wants to do his limits for refugees but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; every EU member must fill his oblig@@ ations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; emphas@@ ized Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government believes in the night , the first refugees had tried to go in the night &apos;s border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / SI@@ D , in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police was able to sei@@ ze them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police have been working with new refugees .
they were mainly by Syri@@ ans and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
the Red Cross , which are already in use , too .
in the coming days , his country , with around 4000 refugees , the Minister of Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , said :
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would also be transferred to the Maz@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , which started mig@@ rants attemp@@ ted to the Hungarian border towards Croatia , reported in the Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade have ruled that it was to submit to people to enter certain routes : &quot; neither is we , nor want to do this . &quot;
according to media reports , in any case , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city SI@@ D , in the course of the day , further buses are expected .
Croatia , Slovenia and Austria after Germany
the occup@@ ants were the whole night of the approximately 500 kilometer away from the Macedonia working border by Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has said that Hungary has said to us that we should go from here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria continue to Germany .
so it could actually actually prev@@ ail@@ ed from ob@@ servers already pre @-@ defined the previous Balk@@ an route Turkey @-@ Greece Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west @-@ line distance .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options to ass@@ ess control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ised that his country had prepared for the case of a strong Zu@@ stro@@ ms by refugees in the possible out@@ skirts .
details he named him not , but he pointed out that Croatia declared as a non @-@ Sch@@ engen Member &quot; comprehensive possibilities to mar@@ g@@ inal control . &quot;
one lead to qualif@@ y through the membership in order to qualif@@ y for the membership in the Sch@@ engen area .
Slovenia has been part of this country since 2007 , the country has passed a good report from the country since then the standard of the border controls .
on the Serbian left there are still 300 refugees in the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had the previous night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed .
if the remaining refugees now want to continue on the Croatian border , is un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior Ne@@ bo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm after a local appointment in H@@ org@@ os . he stop the deb@@ ates on altern@@ atives of refugees after the Hungarian border can now be closed .
it would not have negoti@@ ate a very high refugee .
you could not tell whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers by mig@@ rants , in@@ haz@@ ard@@ ous - altern@@ atives
however , private Swedish refugee shel@@ ters had already begun to distri@@ bute the refugees maps to which alternative routes through Croatia were introduced .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border , there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict - still not cle@@ ared min@@ ef@@ iel@@ ds .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police captured that a team of mines were sent to the border region .

Fed@@ Ex results mixed , Budget for 2016 lowered
Fed@@ Ex dis@@ poses dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer with its winning review on a whole year due to the we@@ aker demand for freight services and higher cost in his ground @-@ service services .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ .000 se@@ asonal workers on vacation .
at this point in the past year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to take 50,000 se@@ asonal workers to spend your holiday time .
the stock was about 2.5 percent at Pre@@ market and 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn an overall profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10 in the financial year , which ends 20 cents less than in the earlier predic@@ ting .
the an@@ alyst@@ s anticip@@ ated an survey by Fac@@ t@@ set 10.9 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.9 percent and will be effective January 4th and despite the higher supplements for ground @-@ transport of heavy @-@ large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said that it did not expect the result from the previous year of cost cutting , higher income and due to growth in the online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will bring the business to solid economic conditions , especially in production and global trade , especially in production and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holidays employment have a day later than that of the Riv@@ als UPS , which is planning to hire 90@@ ,000 to 95@@ .000 extra working forces , approximately the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , that ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex 692 million was $ 6 , and 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , which pre@@ dict the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research Associ@@ ate Anal@@ yst@@ s .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of interest asked an@@ alyst@@ s anticip@@ ated $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in the last years , Fed@@ Ex has successfully achieved a decline in international pri@@ orities , which brought the turnover in its unit Express @-@ shipping to stag@@ n@@ ating .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with Fed@@ Ex Ground .
during the last quarter , sales during ground transport by 29 percent , but the operating result was isolated in the fundament@@ ally flat because of higher costs for higher packages and health insurance .
the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while earnings due to higher cost of labour costs .
in the Pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most expected conference in the year spend Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spent two days this week to decide at a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade &apos;s guid@@ ing .
above them at one end of the decorated , double @-@ storey sessions , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Ch@@ air@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and its colleagues will place the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold contract by the Congress : Maxim@@ ising the US Emp@@ loyment and Prices are stable .
but since the great rec@@ ession we have recognised the F@@ ed Guide that there is not a higher third ex@@ position : financial stability .
and this third mand@@ ate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to say it is predicted to be prev@@ ail@@ ed . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the near @-@ current interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the most recent Tur@@ bul@@ ences could already make pre @-@ saf@@ eg@@ u@@ rous F@@ ed representative on the global financial markets , these volumes are growing by the interest of interest for Federal Government - and it is also just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the labour market and the inflation into first line is the most important what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Chief econom@@ ist at Ma@@ kl@@ er@@ ner founder of Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when searching for a pre@@ text , the interest rate is not raise , the increased un@@ certain@@ ty in the global market is enough to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sens@@ us concerning this what the fe@@ eds will do , which prev@@ ents itself in the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have been sur@@ vey@@ ed from Bloom@@ berg , have predicted this week prior to Bloom@@ berg .
the financial markets are exp@@ ecting the F@@ ed , with a key indic@@ ative , which indicates a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the share capital , if the F@@ ed increased the sentence , it is that the str@@ ate@@ urs will sur@@ vive the blow by saying that a further increase is far away .
at Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Ir@@ ving an average score of 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was fired by expectations that the F@@ ed policy is sustain@@ ed in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om by Moody &apos;s Capital Mark@@ ets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the phr@@ ases at that time , &quot; he said .
in case of doing it , it would have to go very far in their statement to so@@ othing the financial markets , so that they are not in pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts ar@@ gu@@ ed that a interest rate would so@@ othing the financial markets because they would beat the un@@ certain@@ ty when the F@@ ed Act will be elim@@ inated .
even before a month seemed the F@@ ed on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow secondary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
in spring and in early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that in this year , in spite of the bond of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the pro@@ position .
although the creation of jobs in August was slow@@ ed down in August , improve the improvement of the labour market this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the levels you see F@@ ed as whole .
wage increases have been shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation is constantly comm@@ enced under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher rates and needs them on the market on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om with Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ under .
but the financial markets t@@ ally home to the world after the end of last month , after China had given its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average scores in May by more than 16 % less than investors , but investors were fe@@ ared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would destroy global growth .
the market decreased slightly in this month , with the D@@ ow has now been around 10 % below the high of May .
for the tender rep@@ ent@@ atives affect the market tur@@ bul@@ ences the complex calculation , when you should increase the interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weak@@ ness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in recent weeks , she would imp@@ acted by Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of U.S. emergency .
now he claims that they will be at least one month to get the impact better into the handle .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about what the impact on the U.S. economy would be , and there are almost any reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be covered with their decision @-@ making decisions .
but in the final def@@ ect the F@@ ed monetary authorities in the world became the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere h@@ int of the then leadership Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could deg@@ ust her mon@@ et@@ able expansion &apos; ra@@ ises , dis@@ solve conf@@ usion around the world globe .
in a world , in the markets and econom@@ ies , increasingly sur@@ vey@@ ed , the F@@ ed representative are expected to sur@@ vive the developments in other places but also with other central banks and experts adv@@ ise themselves to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more artists as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Jew@@ el , Head of global strategy for the business management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a history of inter@@ actions on the financial market @-@ movements which are not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
l@@ acker , voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee , approved for a interest bearing , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their lead to 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited effects on growth in the US &quot; said L@@ acker .
one year later , the F@@ ed @-@ Repres@@ entative con@@ forms these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis as the market launch in 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on Comm@@ ission@@ er for the Bank of England .
most recent tur@@ bul@@ ences are not coming near this level , he told .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I certainly did not go to the situation in which they fe@@ ared fear of interest , because the markets himself down@@ wards , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act is still the double mand@@ ate , and not mention the financial stability , and is not changed , I don &apos;t think that it should embr@@ ace the time .

Brazilian pap@@ al corpor@@ ation Rio Grande supports diet for healthy bl@@ emen
the Brazilian ped@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization of Spr@@ S is trying to clar@@ ify women as important diet while nurs@@ ing . you do this with the presentation of images of babies , which are painted in bre@@ asts that were painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which you need to transfer all nutrients that you need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mot@@ hers , their daily cal@@ ory intake increased by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only belie@@ ving object to take the mot@@ hers .
a recent study by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women really affects the genes of their babies and protects against the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child &apos;s immune system may be negative impact .

the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar system .
planning for the long @-@ looking turn@@ tables at the Bern@@ rie@@ de skiing area , step by step forward : in the most recent meeting , the construction site was also blessed without any large deb@@ ates .
before that , the panel had an application for an identical &quot; exception &quot; valid &quot; Liberation &quot; by the final development plan . &quot;
with the &quot; exception &quot; there was permission to design a special form on the roof of the roof .
a &quot; post @-@ roof apartment roof is intended to be erected with high @-@ quality First and Roo@@ f@@ top . &quot;
background of planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations : &quot; this way we received a wonderful big Southern and co @-@ roof , &quot; declared may@@ or Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
with the &quot; Liberation , &quot; it was again appro@@ aching the incl@@ ination that is due to energ@@ etic reasons - otherwise than in the development plan - below ten degrees should be reached .
the volume of the hall will be significantly reduced .
a &quot; Liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan has no restri@@ c@@ tive information on the roof of the roof , whereby the Bern@@ ese drug con@@ forms further restri@@ c@@ tively .
but it is not a recur@@ ring project in the turn@@ able project : &quot; we do not make a prec@@ ed@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ns before housing
location on German residential property market is storage .
also more refugees are searching for a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is in front of a challenge .
the pol@@ ishing competition on the German housing market have long begun .
with the coming refugees and unemployment in the EU , more people over a market which is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
it compet@@ ed with income th@@ met@@ able up for the last paid fl@@ ats .
in order to meet the demand for paying the custom apartments , 400,000 new units have to be built up by 2020 .
the result is a study commissioned by the &quot; social housing project &quot; social housing . &quot;
to compare this year , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany .
thus we are missing 140@@ .000 apartments .
refugees are no longer ob@@ li@@ ged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in the first three months of their stay .
many went out on the home market and series in the long be@@ aten in front of the apartments .
according to Statist@@ ical Office , in the last year less than half of all the asylum seek@@ ers for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing district is not just the number of refugees .
the study also provides significant events in the business development policy of recent years .
Germany move a housing defic@@ it before them , which is greater than year ago .
currently , approximately 7@@ 0,000 units were missing in metro@@ politan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
so many working days therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ tar@@ ily for the cottage in the &quot; Hotel Mo@@ m &quot; due to the surface of the housing estate .
in the metro@@ politan region the number of square meters per capita has fallen back in the last few years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing &quot; is a re@@ boot .
in this case , new appe@@ aring in social housing work should be replaced .
so , on the under@@ age tax will be given , and the corn@@ erst@@ one for subsidi@@ zed apartments can be suspended .
according to the contract , the tax @-@ tariff is needed .
the funding programme for refugee and refugees of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well on cities and municip@@ alities already well .
a good week after the start was started on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half the approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia cor@@ ridor with cor@@ ridor
after Hungary &apos;s practi@@ cally no way is practi@@ cally any longer , because more refugees choose the path over Croatia .
Zagreb announces its journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dle without hur@@ dle .
but haz@@ ard@@ ous is the route but non@@ eth@@ eless .
Croatia wants to discover Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees with the neigh@@ bour Spain .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister , and when it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Sch@@ engen area .
the EU @-@ land Croatia is not a Sch@@ engen area yet .
according to the de@@ position of Serbian and Hungarian border hundreds refugees det@@ ect to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have entered the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television channel RTL .
in the eve , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
new laws , which occurred on the same day in force , constit@@ uting the ordinary asylum procedure in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ an@@ ovic was declared : &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this way . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who live and want to reach anything .
there are however people who were not to live in Croatia .
Croatian police killed the first refugees at the border Ser@@ bi@@ ens to the EU neighbour@@ ing country in Croatia .
most of the media reports according to Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they arrived in both the bus as well as tax@@ ed with the Serbian cut city SI@@ D .
immediately after their arrival , she tries to get through the green border to Croatia .
the refugees at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border crossing the refugees not on Gren@@ zz@@ ä@@ n .
this her@@ es from the border strip other d@@ ang@@ ers : there are still sharp mini from the Yugosl@@ av@@ ian civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ ef@@ ar@@ er should now make a secure passage now .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border any more refugees come under no more refugees .
on Tuesday the police captured 366 , t@@ apped people .
shortly before the merger on Monday , there were 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws , over@@ coming and damage to the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ uns first .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southeast of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten up to five years and dep@@ ortation of the country .
according to the immig@@ ration information , you have taken a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday , with almost all of them - 93 - at the main transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applic@@ ants , 13 families with small children , as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there could still be 40 refugees .
practi@@ cally , no one has any more views to get in Hungary As@@ ylum .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the af@@ ore@@ mentioned aces is to be shot down there .
prior to the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only few hundred mig@@ rants were assembled .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke started workers to kick things out .
they raised the gar@@ bage , which had the tens of thousands of people in the road@@ side by the road@@ side .
pl@@ ywood were built and rebuilt in the land@@ mark site in the Grenz@@ land@@ site .
no one is aimed to finish this re@@ struc@@ tor .
after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only few refugees too .
the country also has its border controls .
however , around 20,000 mig@@ rants , however , registered in the country .
about 1400 people wait for the heading to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German authorities .
they regularly met some smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of &quot; Ro@@ dered on the border &quot; over the border
&quot; we were after the bridge @-@ strength on Sunday with the departure and suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of Zel@@ ts , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ one may@@ or Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to pass by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was sur@@ prising on Sunday but because of the refugee @-@ est@@ rogen with Austria , it was called for her in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately comm@@ enced his help and the str@@ anded together with two further hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into near Pass@@ au .
previously , we first met guests only once , with snack and beverages .
we have told , we bring them to the car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was of course , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion .
they were very gr@@ ate@@ ful .
a man would not take it to hand a gener@@ ous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; that was very pleased , &quot; so Stad@@ ler . &quot;
the cont@@ acted enco@@ des were on Sunday evening in Wels , from a ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au , in order to dis@@ continued after the short notice that the rail traffic was dis@@ continued after Germany , but still on the border .
the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border @-@ border grid is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ party association with the Bavarian neigh@@ bo@@ urs held on Sunday in day before a two @-@ brood @-@ running sport@@ y - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án have now send an additional number of thousands to us , is a logical result of a more holy politics :
instead of using R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the construction of structures , human@@ ity ensure human rights , our Chancellor hosted high , and publicly announced the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Soci@@ alism .
the trag@@ edy of these policy are not only those Au@@ stri@@ ans , which has now con@@ fron@@ ted in the bound@@ ary areas with cha@@ otic states .
these fe@@ eds must be determined that the &quot; GE@@ LO@@ B@@ TE &quot; country , &quot; which they are invited and welcome secret , nothing as another refugee camp .
there will be a major challenge in view of the keeping of the refugee and the near winter , as a result of human gest@@ ions for protective seek@@ ers .
and it will be a bigger - peace , security , and stability in Austria .
Konrad in the Search of the 35,000 vin@@ ter@@ firm Qu@@ arti@@ s
Konrad has filled all hands full of all the refugees with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is believed that his word has been .
the government has used the previous novel Raiffeisen ban@@ ker in order to recru@@ it Qu@@ arti@@ s for thousands of refugees .
Konrad can already get the ch@@ aos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s initial area , Konrad can already get in the handle .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tr@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success .
even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who have come to Austria on Monday , be without great ver@@ te@@ bel , said Konrad and pra@@ ised the organiz@@ ational master of the master . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , however , spoke by a &quot; kr@@ is@@ enh@@ af@@ ten situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad with a need of 85@@ .000 qu@@ eries in the year &apos;s year .
in order to ful@@ fil the number , 35,000 accommodations are to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are to be prepared for the country .
if more refugees , we can make it more .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already led talks with the state capit@@ alist .
they had to be sent to him even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works good , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier .
the ex @-@ VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , who shall clar@@ ify how the church will help .
there are great expectations of the asylum coordin@@ ator , as well as the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Hel@@ ps like we . &quot;
on the platform you can offer private individuals un@@ comp@@ lic@@ ated accommodations .
in addition , we hop@@ ed to hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
NOTE that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ator can &apos;t be able to maintain a certain height of the towel @-@ holders or size of the finishing duties .
for long term this time , the policy standards would have to apply .
in contrast to the Interior Ministry of the Home Affairs , Konrad with his experience .
I am an el@@ derly man , who is not ignor@@ ing her face in the face .
convic@@ tion to be his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier cause the Republic of a cost as they explained .
your employee numbers , they want to increase three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ s tests was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as a office .
nevertheless there are obviously trouble with the permission .
Linz calls for a better view
not an opening of urban sport@@ ing and other buildings such as the tips @-@ Arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees , the City of Linz .
at the moment this is not necessary since the affected people could under@@ take these measures , the may@@ or Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) are unknown .
for emergency , further locations are expected to be tested on their do@@ bb@@ ness .

See@@ hofer : &quot; the limits are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone line with the Bavarian Minister @-@ President Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) state capit@@ alist Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the other approach in the refugee question .
See@@ hofer has as@@ sured me that the German borders are not sealed .
in the Federal Republic of Germany , the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there is now the corresponding limits .
special trains with refugees to Germany I will not give it any more .
however , the shel@@ ter would be put into Germany with regular trains to Germany .
by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger had increased more reinforced soli@@ dar@@ ity in the refugees .
now on its borders again in Austria , checks are &quot; a logical sequence &quot; from the approach to Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Quest@@ ion of Time
the general san@@ itation of the &quot; New shi@@ pyard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the IT Group was moved to S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) shall be rented out to young , innovative companies from the technology range .
&quot; it is the leading head of our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T &quot; leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could introduce myself to invest in start@@ up companies from the New Shi@@ pyard .
already at the beginning of the beginning , S &amp; T he wants to co@@ operate with the new neigh@@ bo@@ urs - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er speaks : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a question of time . &quot;
Euro € 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one @-@ third of the city of Linz , Austria , Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is constructed by Linz M S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center for 60 years .

L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in the centre .
actually J@@ utta mas@@ it wanted to lay a dog .
this project had to cut off the 49 @-@ year old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the pi@@ geon market of Ark@@ ad : finally , she has now received growth in the form of another business .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop compared to the business , in which they are sold under other bags , cases , shoes and deliveries of different manufacturers , all about ladies is sold Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
greater bags and accessories cost up to $ 500 .
the new shop in operation since yesterday is the new shop .
it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; I have long thr@@ ust when I was to open a store , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
the decision was decisive for the decision that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a location that only her hand@@ bags will be sold at that .
&quot; we are the only members of the Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who gave himself itali@@ an roots .
her fashion interest has got a cr@@ adle of her mother into the cr@@ adle .
I do@@ cked most of the most if I developed something , and I can make new trends for the current prices .
why such as some woman watching a beautiful hand@@ bag in orn@@ aments , the woman is not respon@@ ding with last security .
perhaps it is about to run a nice bag of each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher ( K@@ all@@ stadt )
the Pf@@ al@@ zer run of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose hab@@ it@@ ant is rel@@ ayed .
this property combines man@@ cher with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always fine .
whether he is extern@@ ally ex@@ ed outside , journalists male , or knowledge merg@@ ed in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US pre@@ sidency were s@@ wir@@ led power@@ fully on the campaign .
and cut well doing .
this is also registered in the cul@@ inary city of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate business grew up .
the New York with the F@@ ist@@ h@@ is@@ ur is a concept to the Win@@ zer@@ dorf at the wine road .
some small corners with him is related to the 1200 inhabitants place .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election mode .
the village of Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about tr@@ ump .
and what think the vill@@ agers over its destination , the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that happens somet@@ ime , but are not so much im@@ pressed in her k@@ stad@@ ter Art , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native coast has created a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ inkl@@ ers , too , where tr@@ unk@@ y also counts the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; is also known , so with the testimony that he would certainly live too much when he would live in K@@ all@@ city .
he was not the king to the heart there .
indeed there may be respect to the performance of the family but also ten@@ ds the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; was already a bit of grand@@ m@@ au@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
for a random from the nickname , the k@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity of the circle , &quot; The h@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - at high @-@ German : the rel@@ ber , says it .
so Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the staff .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the future of grand@@ father was emig@@ rated , and in the USA a local for gold dig@@ gers opened .
Grund@@ stein of the Real Estate Company was first real estate sales in New York .
but life of the grand@@ parents was not free of trag@@ ic : your wish to return to home to the native state , belonged to the Bavarian state , in which the Pfalz had belonged .
he did not go dr@@ unk@@ y , because he once was without homologation , had the director of the institute for pe@@ eling history and folk music , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
go to the grand@@ son of an &quot; Il@@ legal emig@@ rated &quot; to attack . &quot;
this stands in contrast to the mit@@ age limit of the desc@@ endants .
he repeat@@ edly talked about Mexican immig@@ rants in the United States , and the construction of a border wall requested to take illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ises , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a dist@@ ressed family Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a beg@@ otten tr@@ ump , the O@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ akers on retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ant , &quot; it is always so br@@ ating . &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never fought against K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension administ@@ rator in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , such as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , how a desc@@ endant of the family of Heinz came on a visit to the church , which was generally well appro@@ aching .
&quot; I didn &apos;t imagine to imagine , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says this .
they make it better if it does not make choice of choice , for &quot; that has such a radi@@ cal belie@@ v@@ ings , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot;
if those who had died at the time of his grand@@ father in the USA were , as though he had been , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; says it .
and : &quot; the grapes also become sex@@ ually mature without the President . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , inter@@ viewed for the tr@@ ump long , have seen 12 000 theat@@ ric@@ ers , also in the USA .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will choose ?
reve@@ als mystery ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have possibly evi@@ dent - who is the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor .
the woman who finally land@@ ed on Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envelop@@ ed in the biggest secret position .
and no of the three remaining girls will not give in@@ expensive , whether they are the one who received the last Rose .
but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three two will have checked , you may have to see a note that he will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips up to the final on Thursday
all three women left out on the ly@@ rical characteristics , why there is the perfect man and called his sense to hum@@ or , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should be Wo@@ ods last Rose ? &quot; in order to get rid of the game of the player , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or .
E@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki are both fast - apart from himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had one easy relationship with each other for the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energi@@ es , there I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that in the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah laugh@@ s at the feet in the earth , making it a lot of fun with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the correct chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that it is well suited to Sam Wood as a pair .
from its perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit lasts last week , &quot; Wood &quot; the one could be one . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and his family , I became clear that this is obviously not only a game - I told him , he told him . &quot; she said .
and when it was asked if you choose the wood , if not they , they were sad@@ ly .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls ali@@ ke - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams that sent to its impressive day training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and a trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a huge decision .
some trainer had felt Hay@@ ne for the rest of the match on the bank as he lost a rum@@ or as it did the Aussie m@@ Rug@@ by le@@ ague conver@@ ti@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota .

Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his live face in the dressing cab@@ ine after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encour@@ aged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened himself in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne is encour@@ aged by special squ@@ ads coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ he@@ y , who for@@ got to forget his for@@ ti@@ ed f@@ ang to take care of the next game .

Hay@@ ne left the field of game after the F@@ um@@ ble , he later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not take a worse Start in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was a thing that now comes ahead , you will take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne conf@@ essed the squ@@ ck@@ ling with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a pas@@ sport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al region led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .

for lightweight di@@ abet@@ ics , weight loss can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery in very easy over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last up to a new study for at least five years .
it is still early to say if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery is longer live as those who get non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a guid@@ ing item to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery .
weight loss operations , and ob@@ es@@ ity surgery , use different methods to do the magn@@ itude of the stomach .
you reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to take food .
over the years , ob@@ es@@ ity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proven as effici@@ ently , but most studies have been carried out with human body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a weigh@@ ted measure of weight in relation to size is available as normal between 18,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that som@@ eb@@ ody is over@@ weight and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the researchers used the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of ob@@ es@@ ity surgery - Mag@@ b@@ ypass and magn@@ ets in medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people that were easily over@@ weight .
the average BMI of those that sub@@ jected their surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who were non @-@ surgical types received approximately equal to 29 .
among those who sub@@ jected to a surgical procedure , affects 36 % of the diabetes quality completely , and with 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the diabetes increased only by one percent , and partially with only about two percent .
these results were also reflected in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ to &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found out the authors .
the researchers created the patient blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which refle@@ cts the blood glucose levels during the time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c was held by the best below 7 percent .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as being reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not the mortality rate of five years , so the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also refer to the two types of surgery in the first two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass motor group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger re@@ medi@@ es in BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded more complete over@@ sight of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no translation of surgery after five years , there are indic@@ ations from a study heav@@ ier people in Sweden that surgery is leading to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was at ob@@ ese people who under@@ went a loss of ob@@ es@@ ity , about 29 per cent fewer than in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that attemp@@ ted conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is calm for people with a BMI below 35 , which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors begin to take weight as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait for long until we bring people to do this , &quot; she said .
I think that once they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes that have led their body with ob@@ es@@ ity and diabetes , is a fan really hard . &quot;

&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the Ven@@ om Re@@ formation of the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not make a si@@ p of whis@@ key , but people let this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .

de Bo@@ er , currently a am@@ bassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland it doesn &apos;t show highlights of the Cel@@ tic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the rank@@ ings are not there .

they speak about Old Fir@@ m .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it rises .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period of May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period increased to € 1,@@ 82 million .
the unemployment rate of 5.9 percent amounted to 5.5 per cent over the U@@ Ks , including the figures for the National Statist@@ ics for the National Statist@@ ics ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , the employment fell in Scotland around 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell during the quarter of the quarter to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell comm@@ ented the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made a historic decision to stay in part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have further experiences on the Scott@@ ish labour market with an increase of employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I &apos;m an execution to be in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a bit later , except for a late right intervention , I will to see how a man becomes too death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not done , I will sit in an amazing gallery at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary where Richard Gl@@ oss@@ p is executed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation only took place in January through his best friend and although I was sho@@ cked , I cons@@ ented .
when the day appro@@ aching , I started to fear me .
so , why should I do it ?
I agree to because I thought it would be a good way to tell the entire story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can be seen in the USA , and there are often more applications as places available , there is a powerful Lot@@ tery runs to decide , who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of the media sites from 12 to five .
those who selected is to watch it is emot@@ ional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be sitting next to Richard Gl@@ oss@@ oms , with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with telephone and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh much when we speak .
the authorities of authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to aband@@ on my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the in@@ mate , as it wants to and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained me with her .
they sp@@ ati@@ ze that it could have been better , &quot; but they always think that it &apos;s false , what I do .
Richard Gl@@ oss@@ p had problems with some of things I have said and wrote .
he says to me not what I have to write ; and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants to present an international rep@@ orter to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relations work in the movement is due to death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Pod@@ casts which I made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here .
I cannot say that Richard Gl@@ oss@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would raise him guilty , a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the crime happened .
but I believe that there is a strong prob@@ ability that he is not guilty of murder .
I think , there &apos;s not enough evidence in order to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I think that its execution is err@@ one@@ ous .
and from that perspective I &apos;ll see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be obj@@ ec@@ tively speaking .
there will be other rep@@ orter where you can turn .
what you get from me is what it means to die for a un@@ necessary death .
men after mo@@ ist police @-@ pursu@@ e @-@ pursu@@ es , proce@@ eds from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning Vale policy is dry when he talked to the man of C@@ anning River .
once a man of Perth , had fallen by the police , was un@@ successful when he was found in the sil@@ encing and sum@@ marily water , just a few metres from a police raid , tried to talk to returning to the bank . &quot;
the Police of C@@ anning Vale was founded on Tuesday at a house of pe@@ ac@@ efully in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , it attemp@@ ted to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he was not too far too far .
&quot; he was in the water , saying &apos; I come out to come , come and hol me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Sh@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Const@@ able l@@ ach@@ lan Per@@ h@@ av@@ ec was not too exc@@ ited to make his uniform wet , so he turned a reliable tac@@ tic to - &quot; A good policy is listed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it &apos;s funny things to escape attemp@@ ts , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Master @-@ Football Player Ben Co@@ us@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , Co@@ us@@ ins drove its car to the tr@@ ench to escape an alcohol check , and then tried to sw@@ im over the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired ind@@ isp@@ ru@@ dence to the hum@@ or@@ ously planning of a Ben Co@@ us@@ ins .
Peter Moody claimed that ste@@ wards temp@@ ted him trying to end him , and threat@@ ens to end the racing
Peter Moody claimed that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria is trying to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables , and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the integration division of racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the Late Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai , because of a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw @-@ up on wed@@ n@@ esday .
in Moody , Fair@@ fax Media said that it is always trying to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself among difficult conditions as it went to the Pos@@ itive co@@ b@@ alt test in L@@ id@@ aris , which he cannot explain .
he had turned 18 months because of the sp@@ ion@@ age pre@@ season , and didn &apos;t wanted to see that it could see . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing else , and I have sat on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated , that everything is coming out , &quot; said Moody .
they know that there is far@@ ing .
sometimes they re@@ act , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live what I said .
I will go home evening and sleep well .
I would like to rent it , and I would like to think of my owner , that I try my best for it .
if it begin to think , I do not do that I should not do more .
I have to do then , what I do with my license .
before that , in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , the bom@@ b had tried to break his st@@ all his st@@ all .
&quot; before the eigh@@ teen months wat@@ ering Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I would be asked to give him a employment in my ste@@ als to do more about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moody based on Rac@@ ing.com .
they think that I am a fr@@ aud .
if that is the case , they should surely move at their n@@ oses , because they exam@@ ine me at the attempt to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RV L , David Mo@@ ody , reign@@ ing President of RV L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , the current CEO of RV L , were still aware of the time and are still alive today .
should I bring to the view that it is personally done ?
have the RV L to be celebrated , and perhaps the people outside of the practice is responsible for what is going to happen in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
&apos;m so bad about the industry ?
perhaps the people think there , that I am .
perhaps they must take my license and take me away , and I have no doubt that I say what I say it now think about it now .
but I arrived at the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter what it is sad .
that really makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on them and come to make a decision .
I have support my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the training was built with the long @-@ lasting fi@@ b@@ alt test at L@@ id@@ ari , and the Late Sc@@ at@@ ching so that he said &quot; he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
Moody , best known for his preparation of the unbe@@ atable Mei@@ sters Black Caviar , awarded the racing @-@ day treatment rule &quot; after a pack of mud or sound on the horse debate , was something against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I have to take full responsibility for that , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff did ir@@ r@@ ush slip on the leg .
it would like to be so yesterday .
it would like to be like that day , what also was so .
but it was also at the race day .
in addition , Moody could con@@ fron@@ ts with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package at the race day . an investigation contained in this matter was opened .
it is a jo@@ ke .
people who put these rules , don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need the rules , but here one went to far , &quot; said Moody .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy hits towards ri@@ val back to fight out
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy is critic@@ ism of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League fav@@ or@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ar@@ bit@@ rator in the Storm players &quot; fight &quot; with his team during the high Storm victories in the qualifying finals in Sydney will be allowed on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hard cover to the Storm team , having achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; pattern book &quot; of Rug@@ by League , and told that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land no &quot; too well &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the worst of his team , and said that she can only be concentr@@ ating on her &quot; contact &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that critic@@ ism of two leading trainer ass@@ essed his team in his team , since it was de@@ eply im@@ ited that they made Sor@@ gen to be be@@ aten by the Storm team .
&quot; it is di@@ pped again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ aming , when she had be@@ aten us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy am Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed in our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es , and this has been committed to the trend of trace sol@@ st@@ ice .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he did not exercise a great team for three years . he is therefore probably los@@ ing to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is already funny , as it appears again in this season .
Bell@@ amy served as a prestigious idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and his ment@@ or remin@@ ds that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra will won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; lang@@ we@@ ges@@ er &quot; football .
Wayne made by exciting football .
he lik@@ ed his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George as a bor@@ ing team was critical , and Wayne told that he would take care of a di@@ vor@@ ous thing .
but now he has got a team to play this and which we see as exciting , in particular his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the Ball@@ play , you &apos;d like to play this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not each team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play as they play .
I build further confidence , because they say these things , because they are a bit concerned , to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not have thought so as it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs Roo@@ ster was a higher result than the game of Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game but I haven &apos;t seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further tests in our game , but this is an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses , and don &apos;t points any points ?
it is the music plans for me .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase .
the Storm team has arrived on this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ es at the final Saturday in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales start from next service tomorrow .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ security on drug cl@@ an@@ age
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong penalty is threat@@ ening to get to co@@ ve in the possession of 40 kilos of co@@ ca@@ ine that ad@@ orn@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released on a bond of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the police have found 100 kg of drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , accompanied by South America via V@@ anu@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic was observed after his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police got 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite being a great pun@@ ishment for attemp@@ ts to poss@@ ess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , ar@@ gu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic that it was no evidence that he tried to poss@@ ess the whole lot and that in the café from a harm@@ less reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Fl@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the flood on Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
he consi@@ ders the police over his stay .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics Mother and St@@ ie@@ f@@ Father had offered a cau@@ tion of 200,000 dollars as security together to get his release .
&quot; after reading the re@@ plac@@ ements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation represents an impact of 200,000 dollars a real financial burden , &quot; said Jud@@ ge Fl@@ ag@@ an .
but that alone will not go out to hold it out of it , he war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and Serbian pas@@ sport , which arrived daily at the police at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are de@@ able
the Federal Constitutional Court has been given a former prison@@ er of the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ent institu@@ tion Law which was placed in a small cell in a small cell .
due to viol@@ ation of human rights , det@@ ain@@ ees should be eligible for financial compensation when they are located in small cells .
this decision decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a late Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges may hope that if they were only restricted for a few days in close areas ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
in Paris , an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successfully executed in Karlsruhe : he was placed in the Just@@ if@@ ying Institute Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in an individual cell with about five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separated .
after that , the man , who is now transferred to many feet , has been laid down at free feet in a large cell .
he was dis@@ pat@@ ched due to his det@@ ective sentence because of un@@ worthy indictment against the country Berlin .
but the Constitutional Court ren@@ dered the verdict of the Court of Berlin on and demonstrated the case to rest@@ ing there .
they see the human tra@@ p of man .
K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ x now deci@@ des on the amount of compensation
even if of legal reasons for the question@@ able period , only a few days of o@@ ats for compensation regarding the compensation was given , whether it was compensation , was called .
otherwise , &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ous of the law@@ ful protection of the person@@ ality &quot; would be wor@@ ry . &quot;
the com@@ bat@@ ter must now clar@@ ify the amount of money compensation .
the Constitutional rec@@ orders have often d@@ ressed the rights of pun@@ ching cap@@ tivity in the past .
in April , they first spoke in a det@@ ain@@ ring because he was naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision by 2011 , also the multiple of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , at the next Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had a prison@@ er in a parall@@ el@@ age in November 2009 gave a de@@ cent instrument of de@@ vised accommodation .
the former cl@@ am@@ ers crossed over three months , between 15 to 21 hours in a compar@@ ative cell as at Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also involved in the last weeks , because of a lack of staff in head@@ lines .
cap@@ tives will always be kept for 23 hours , the ag@@ gression increases , even to concl@@ us@@ ations , it is supposed to be able to sw@@ allowed it .
according to the ju@@ di@@ cial time there are 21 positions in Te@@ gel for young people not occupied , 19 will fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the Re@@ fuge@@ e policy : &quot; we do the &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chanc@@ ellery is determined to accept them .
what comes in Germany ?
according to forecasts for the Federal Ministry of Education in Germany , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , after statement by Deputy Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , and in the situation to increasing one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrate because of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say , and again , we can make that , and we do . &quot;
what arri@@ ves in Germany , has the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the pest@@ ici@@ des Institute ) apartments and for the next five years .
this is twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
very dram@@ atically , the lack of living space , especially at affordable rental : year 60000 @-@ 800@@ 00 social apartments from the rental rate will be out , and around these very reasonable apartments are strug@@ gl@@ ed for refugees .
according to the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , the funding from currently 518 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from sight of the pest@@ ici@@ des institute : 80 000 residential apartments would have to be annually and this would have to invest some 6.4 billion dollars annually .
in addition , scientists and Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs is that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in the housing construction .
according to the estimates of the Institute for labor market and professional research , 55 percent of those who have been working in Germany at short @-@ term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be system@@ atically asked regarding their qualification to help them , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
however , it is cru@@ cial for the integration of refugees , but this is cru@@ cial in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation of the admission company , but also for self @-@ est@@ e@@ em the immig@@ rant , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher , Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , Germany has given a political turn : &quot; labour provided for the recognition of labour .
while previously a working bid for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the re@@ sid@@ y , the asylum seek@@ ers will be restricted to a residential area .
in the society itself , - also due to the specialist so@@ lic@@ er - majority of vis@@ ually benef@@ ic@@ ial that refugees will be able to en@@ rol faster on the labour market .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German knowledge .
so far , there is no stri@@ king quot@@ ation for general and occup@@ ational voice services .
research shows that the stations will be used at the most frequently due to personal contact .
the structure of the networks is therefore to view of Thr@@ aci@@ hardt of the König@@ s@@ weg path .
the Berlin School administration has found that only a few @-@ fle@@ dged parents may spend their children in the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the roots of the parents , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
in order to con@@ vin@@ ce the family of K@@ ita &apos;s advantages , several languages are distributed in various languages .
if necessary , if necessary , go down through the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities by increasing more local schools .
on the other hand , students are prepared without German language skills on the lessons .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second one .
there is no lack of lack , said Be@@ ate st@@ all arise from Berlin training administration .
the German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany study .
in principle , there is no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or en@@ rolled the study - the only exception was Berlin , the Sen@@ sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position now .
school of refugees could facil@@ itate an easy access to university education .
because refugees with a con@@ servation or Dul@@ ce will not get any benefits after the asylum seek@@ ing@@ ent law , if they begin in a course .
the latter also get nau@@ gh@@ ted b@@ af@@ o@@ g because they did not fall under the district of b@@ ann@@ ex@@ al persons .
in response to date , four years had to have lived in Germany to be eligible to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 , these span reduced to 15 months .
but these financial gap will also be closed when Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Hall .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ o@@ g instantly .
in future , Islam will play an important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion became important part of their identity .
the state should be gradually introduced the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches will keep right to a new state of religi@@ ons .
important would be also important to take care of an Islamic co @-@ welfare state that takes care of the new an@@ vil @-@ blade .
among the rights , duties are also oblig@@ ations .
so , the representatives of Islam have to come into a clear response partner of some and ready to work with the state in many areas and give him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the read@@ iness to pres@@ cri@@ bed against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , who ind@@ ul@@ ted on Thursday the conc@@ ern , religious conflic@@ ts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to take such conflic@@ ts of conflict in Germany , &quot; have immediately standing their right to we@@ ave here in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio .
he suggested to transl@@ ate the Basic Law on Arab in Arabic .
integration will be still present a lot more than today a topic of all the company .
in order to change the majority society , the dis@@ continu@@ ation of dis@@ cri@@ mination and rac@@ ism is in@@ tri@@ mm@@ ed .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - as a result of European decisions - for a decade of anti @-@ dis@@ cri@@ mination and a general classification Act .
but it became very slow to show how the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities that system@@ atically ig@@ no@@ red rapidly .
same chan@@ ces for all : what mig@@ rant companies and the adv@@ oc@@ acy groups should have been mort@@ al for long and what international agreement such as the anti@@ r@@ ass@@ is@@ mus@@ isation , Germany have to be reality in the next years , if the country is peaceful and with their new citizens are supposed to take their possibilities for the sole of all .
in general , Germany was able to maintain the expected refugees for the expected refugees , the state medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; what MAN@@ - Power and Capacities will we do , &quot; he told the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , let the money close their money into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ec@@ ks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for all deriv@@ ing with the registration of health types .
achievements could be settled with the federal states .
and long @-@ term it be highly un@@ question@@ able , so many people live with the limited power catalogue to see the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise we make the physi@@ ci@@ ans to create the language bar@@ riers .
so far , the Berlin health sci@@ entist The@@ a Bor@@ de are proven that mig@@ rants are ex@@ termin@@ ated worse than other patients .
not only in clin@@ ics , also to the physician &apos;s surg@@ eries have to be taken over , requ@@ est@@ ing them .
but many refugees had been helped to continue with more non @-@ profit studies in the emergency cases .
and with another diagnostic view .
under the refugee camp there may be much more un@@ treated dis@@ abilities , and with the adol@@ esc@@ ents go to HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with the partially other disease pattern for German doctors , however , German doctors from her apprenti@@ ces@@ hip is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery moves .
&quot; par@@ as@@ ite wr@@ ong@@ es or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recogn@@ ise : &quot; and what the trouble is concerned , whether by the refugees , perhaps even a change in sight .
the Syri@@ ans have had a highly developed educational system , some refugees were even doctors .
in order to be practi@@ ced , however , they would have to prove their qualification and wom@@ ans once more tests .
half of the refugees in Germany are psych@@ olog@@ ically ill , according to estimates of the Bundes@@ psych@@ other@@ ap@@ ist ammer ( BP@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ olog@@ ically ill : most suffer from post@@ hum@@ mental de@@ pression or de@@ pression .
in particular , Viol@@ ence of Re@@ fuge@@ e , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the BP@@ t@@ K .
the TU Munich recently published a recent survey of the TU Munich that arri@@ ves every fifth Syrian refugee camps in Germany .
everyone who is in post @-@ traum@@ atic resist@@ ive tract is suff@@ ers to the so @-@ called Flash back@@ s with re@@ spir@@ atory , sw@@ ing@@ arm , cardi@@ ov@@ y and death .
further symptoms are sleeping and concentrations of trouble , strong terror and emot@@ ional de@@ th@@ iness .
to prevent the symptoms of chronic would be necessary , a tim@@ ely treatment was necessary .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ological sick refugees have received a psych@@ otherapy .
psych@@ olog@@ ically ill the asylum seek@@ ers can imagine an application for psych@@ otherapy , but it usually takes several months .
in addition , in the soci@@ eties , the social workers are mostly trained , or doctors who are not trained to mental health whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to false ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege Inv@@ ites to dream a
with the new st@@ aging of passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst go back to the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to under@@ go any age group in the B@@ ann from fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal shel@@ ter and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst go to the brick on the bri@@ cks .
&quot; our passion is the Cir@@ cus &quot; .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine , without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and the Junior team .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management team .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
so the gift to insp@@ ire the family is in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take people from their everyday use and take it for two hours into a completely different world , emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old jun@@ ior chamber .
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tail equipped with Welt@@ stadt @-@ Fl@@ air , &quot; then Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
this fl@@ air can now see 50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour .
the Cir@@ cus Programme is convinced with tal@@ ented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown family moves to the audience with jo@@ ke and charm into her head .
the Cast@@ illo Brothers also handle their handic@@ raft .
the Cub@@ an duo will absor@@ bs up the her@@ oes of the silent films .
in these words , ease and mobility - with these words .
their hum@@ orous art in the mast is to capture clouds at the storm .
except through numerous salmon enc@@ om@@ passes the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst with finger@@ print and joints .
along with the unic@@ y@@ cle of the ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sn@@ ake and sm@@ ells along at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like a little , and fas@@ c@@ inated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations provide diversity in every aspect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ ises Steph@@ es &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
Miss@@ ile counts in the attitude of circulation are only all@@ ying with different animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes the position : &quot; it is not good , neither is our animals well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read after the possibility of any request from their eyes .
we want to work together with animals and have fun with them .
does the be@@ ast feel well , I will not go to the arena .
so the most high commandment is : good for the animals .
especially on her z@@ ebro@@ id Jumbo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land@@ pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and one of Zeb@@ ra@@ st@@ ute is the family pro@@ ud@@ ly pro@@ ud@@ ly .
the two animals have lived in a secret places and nothing happens .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jumbo noise , &quot; tells Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the z@@ ebro@@ id is not ready for the practice , but it is the unique mascot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so for every visitor you would be something to be there .
&quot; one is sure &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether there are five or 1 200 vie@@ wers , we always give our best and with a whole heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst charges between 17 and 20 September daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .

Thursday the family day , on the introduction at 17 o &apos;clock , prices are reduced .
furthermore , the Tier@@ schau is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe holds false declaration in Parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest Guide , fell down the steps at the beginning of the year .
he continued un@@ hurt , but the video of the case was spread quickly over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening of Parliament was also benef@@ ited by asser@@ tion by members of the opposition that they had war@@ ned after compl@@ aint death thre@@ ats and war@@ ned on the language of Mr Mug@@ abe in Bu@@ h@@ mus .
last month , they made him b@@ lown up and found him interrup@@ ted during his speech at the situation of the Nation in parliament - this is the address given by the Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions polit@@ icians said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions polit@@ icians said to their cell phones that war@@ ned that it war@@ ned against Mug@@ an@@ es .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not indicated , but she published the title &apos; death &apos; , said he wanted to speak to Mug@@ ab@@ es .
they war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that ends the imm@@ unity in parliament , and once they leave the parliament , its parliamentary imm@@ unity would not be effective any more effective .
the spokes@@ person said that she was a party of Morgan T@@ sv@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai , &quot; talked about the d@@ ang@@ ers of polit@@ icians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in the context of re@@ struc@@ turing and savings of the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split up in two ar@@ sen@@ ed companies , and the computer and pr@@ inters business was split from its faster @-@ growing hardware and its service activities .
the expected loss relief will lead to a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP showed in a statement .
&quot; these re@@ struc@@ turing measures will enable a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Ch@@ air@@ woman and Chief Executive that will lead the unity to the separation .
the Hewlett Packard Enterprise is powered by small and stronger than the HP today , and we have a wide range of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better installed than ever before to satis@@ fy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US annual revenue , and is to be focused on the provision previously , with integrated technology solutions for companies to be concentr@@ ating , &quot; a statement of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s from the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard was founded in order to produce electric plants and whose Palo Alto garage , &quot; the birth of the Silicon Valley , &quot; which was founded in the 19@@ 30s .

FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ am@@ bus@@ y before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere have to stand
W@@ enger st@@ ressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was not until September and if its rehabil@@ itation runs after plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before christ@@ mas !
this optim@@ istic scenario suggest@@ s that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace with this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate kn@@ u@@ ck@@ ling latter , and then returned to his old sw@@ ings during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of inj@@ ury is not threatened the career , &quot; told W@@ enger .
it is a bone , that is not good .
this is not a greater matter .
this was just a accident .
it was not in conjunction with his daughters or with the inju@@ ries he had previously .
this may be true from pure medical vis@@ ibility , but how W@@ enger also acknowle@@ dged also the corresponding risk of further inju@@ ries , in the middle of the season , is trying to return in the middle of the season .
it is also designed to have an un@@ pleasant design .
the examination of Premier In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als and 157 Lig@@ ure in the last five game times .
Arsenal &apos;s larger image for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight players since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs , who have to be able to have the most inju@@ ries .
W@@ enger acc@@ epts the potential of a devil &apos;s journey , and Arsenal believe that an improvement during the inju@@ ries during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from a inj@@ ury , you have a mom@@ en@@ --@@ time period , in which you need to strengthen your body and combat strength , &quot; said W@@ enger .
jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope his body stabil@@ ized , I am conf@@ id@@ ent that he will do it and he will run in a career of the kind he des@@ erv@@ ed .
Arsenal starts the Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening to play Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur on upcoming Wednesday , and W@@ enger introduces a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start away .
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o MON@@ RE@@ AL and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; I tried to maintain the balance and to players who require a little break break , &quot; said W@@ enger .
although Arsenal &apos;s clear Favor@@ ites , by Group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots with the largest inser@@ tion effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign in the last season was launched .
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night , where the Richter scale was measured at the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal has moved out of the past season with the Champions League @-@ capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains un@@ able to lead the club to its first European voc@@ al tri@@ umph .
&quot; this drive is imm@@ ens , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it still has never done between ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were in the year 2006 very close to this , but on the other side I am long enough to be realistic to be realistic .
we are hon@@ e@@ worthy , but we are no missed .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons on male friends
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is apparent , especially in terms of care , as the need for men to open , now still doubled as ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ ph@@ ate amongst young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high popular@@ ity .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death for men under the age of 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more frequently in men than women .
in an effort to t@@ ack@@ le the problem , the Camp@@ aign Ag@@ ainst living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a inher@@ ent life ) 2015 became the year of man to ask with the aim to seek the culture in question , when they are searching for these needs .
friendship is the heart piece in battle to master this challenge .
a recent study by more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms confirmed that if the suffer@@ er has a suff@@ ici@@ ently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere &quot; to double its od@@ ds to gen@@ esis .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ve a circle of spiritual healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you must have only once more friends , that a friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communication with its emph@@ asis on nature , the Im@@ centr@@ ation of Re@@ ply is often more important than an important step .
our digital life have the need to appear sever@@ ely , liv@@ ely and successful , even if in reality the isolation are dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by the domin@@ ant , psych@@ ologists extr@@ al@@ ic values , money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ tr@@ in@@ ic values - our inner se@@ em@@ y according to personal development and friendship which affects our intel@@ lec@@ tual health .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really buy good .
the creation of friends was that this foc@@ using on the head was turned up@@ side down .
each character has not been defined by his work , but by his person@@ ality , the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler are frequent U@@ mar@@ es , Mom@@ ents as a football gu@@ cken from Ross to Rachel : all this came from the knowledge that men can rely on any case , even if they often keep going back to explore complete their fe@@ el@@ ings .
like a staff of the telephone line it explained : ... &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who feel de@@ pres@@ sive and self @-@ materi@@ ality , has really well shown me as even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends could make a difference . &quot;
the males who contact us feel often not in the situation to talk to friends .
the old Re@@ de@@ perf@@ ecting &quot; I come so quite &quot; has a trem@@ end@@ ous effect , like feeling that it is perc@@ eived as flu@@ ent if you open problems to open . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that arri@@ ves in the sense when I try to do long @-@ term mechan@@ isms .
it clearly show@@ cases the little mom@@ ents of men friendly .
so very my objective of an outdoor se@@ iter status is also able to help people with ease of des@@ per@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .

di Maria meets PS@@ G to help PS@@ G to m@@ alt Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bl@@ aise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani to his hits on Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League at the Tuesday and hel@@ ping PS@@ G to go to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani remained course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with a extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory at Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ parking stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League winning as PS@@ G players who brought the French Master in the way , but afterwards it missed a series of cas@@ ions before they finally achieved its lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head rot@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ jor Don@@ ez@@ k , in the group A needed a strong start against the Swedish Champion , since they are not only going to qualif@@ y for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Round , but an improvement on the journey into quarters in each of the last three camp@@ a@@ ign@@ s .
but while she was given the points of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ &apos;s team , it was not a pas@@ siv@@ ity of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ im@@ ics . he was later in the game against his home @-@ town @-@ team and against the association with whom he started his illustr@@ ate career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or going to Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponent , even if there are certain things we have to be perfect during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I would like to re@@ gre@@ t that we won &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ brah@@ im@@ ovic returned to Paris @-@ team after his inj@@ ury in one of three changes to Paris @-@ Team , which was able to keep on its own position against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was born in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was referred to as the man called PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he went on to the next month of Manchester United in the last month , before he arrived into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö Sea , before he finished in a long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a major victory that was dis@@ appointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic in an Play @-@ off to reach this level , entered the field with nine nation@@ alities on the field and was pu@@ ff@@ ed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but except a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who fell on Kevin Te@@ apps in the 34@@ th minute , they did not tell them a little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up , with some wr@@ ap@@ ses and bad dis@@ patches , not least by I@@ brah@@ im@@ ovic , who was not less than five attemp@@ ts alone in the first half , after Cav@@ ani was used after rest@@ art after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more sk@@ ill , when he brought his fellow player to play , and it was a pass of I@@ brah@@ im@@ ovic , who was given to a swing in which from Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute to the posts where ...
the second goal was finally reached after the hours @-@ brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans &apos; achieved its six@@ teen se@@ asonal route , after I@@ brah@@ im@@ ovic had been hand@@ led a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this finished all thoughts on that Malm@@ ö will come back to the game , and only an excellent distance from Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could stop the end result before the player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
ever since then we played only in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level .
the qualif@@ ications are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Detroit Tig@@ ers schlei@@ chen to Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny .
once earlier , they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eb@@ all , today the tig@@ ers hit the final place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part in Tuesday perfect against the Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins van@@ ished a chance to asc@@ en@@ sion within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , there was a return of the three letters F @-@ voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ f , that &apos;s over a huge part of the second half of the season so difficult to bre@@ eds .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Out@@ m .
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support that Detroit lost three times in the first two inner points , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) sm@@ ote 6 times on the 1 / 3 inside and allowed three conditions for us .
it was not his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I will qu@@ it this year , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen of each game , and so I will definitely go into the game .
the des@@ ig@@ ated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has weak@@ ened the pl@@ ywood , &quot; said extinc@@ t .
he looked good from the ( percussion instrument ) , saw distinc@@ tly out of the bul@@ l@@ do@@ zers , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three edges at the end of the seventh home , T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game again .
Center Fiel@@ der B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended up with a double at the left field of Fel@@ dl@@ in@@ ie .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks achieved a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Link@@ sh@@ änder Bl@@ aine Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y left the wall , the only man , with whom he was con@@ fron@@ ted , from the des@@ ig@@ ated Rookie s@@ ats@@ man Miguel S@@ ano who was the right @-@ handed tri@@ w collar .
with a pair of le@@ aps and the finishing @-@ run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at a Double Play .
it was the major le@@ ague in the major le@@ ague 27th times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double Play
after Detroit added an ins@@ ance @-@ Run event in the end of the ninth , this wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed , however , S@@ ano were present in three Pit@@ ches for fifth place .
in Detroit , Detroit benef@@ ited from the game from a still no moving Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three dates in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who was elim@@ inated before the game by the viol@@ ist &apos;s inj@@ ury , after having been fast@@ ed more than a month after the back of the sp@@ oil .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I had w@@ ished me &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt glad when I left and felt that I would make some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after being received in the first Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ vest@@ ers .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought the game Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single at the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third attempt to get the threat .
the tig@@ ers laid in the second , armed One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he doesn &apos;t be@@ aten up well , but he doesn &apos;t know the right spot .
Hug@@ hes was in a pitch @-@ Count , there was no points in the third inning before being replaced by the re@@ ver jo@@ int@@ ly A.@@ J.@@ Ag@@ ter .
so at Hug@@ hes , we came to three hits at six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez was elim@@ inated because of infr@@ ing@@ ement of the wor@@ th@@ ence .
he studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operate the shoulder from San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , on the mid @-@ August to the inju@@ ries result for a shoulder @-@ err@@ ation , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is cancelled by the hurt list to launch the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers , since then he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has fallen in the right hip of the hip on August 20th , because of a cont@@ err@@ ation .
the tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games to play in the target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 4 4.@@ 43 ERA ) is used against Min@@ nes@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
there are almost 500 years after the Re@@ formation , Rome is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
in the presence of San Ign@@ az@@ io Marino , a previously named nam@@ eless gap in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill is bapt@@ ised on the name of the German Re@@ formation .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now hon@@ oured out as &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Re@@ formation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name of the ev@@ angel@@ ical churches in Rome was requested by the community of the ev@@ angel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , Pastor of the Protest@@ ant Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the pop@@ es about centuries as a min@@ ority often live in secret by their faith .
with the place in sym@@ bo@@ lic manner the tradition of Christian faith was welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) spent a young August@@ ine in Rome for the year 1510 / 11 a couple of months .

hammer artists invested three years to the personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilded ) Sle@@ eping Beauty is one of the major works by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has appeared now with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning it was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formed his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical writing on paper and screen in 150 mot@@ ives .
his &quot; language &quot; with color@@ ful colours and imag@@ in@@ ational forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is exactly the same level with &quot; funny &quot; Pictures .
on the contrary , on the particular subject , it can work out quite no@@ zzles .
Ot@@ mar alto has worked in his bi@@ ble project for three years , for which he has met a sub@@ j@@ ective @-@ artistic selection from the many them@@ ed areas of the &quot; book &quot; of all books . &quot;
each other cycles have been cycles , who are them@@ es like the Cross , Pl@@ agues , Command@@ ments , or Pra@@ yer our Pra@@ yer .
the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books , thus said : this is the same way for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation .
and there is primarily the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has put themselves on the basis of painting with the respective Bible verses .
he is interpre@@ ted by Ot@@ mar Alt select the Bible verses , and translated into the very day in the present case . &quot;
these ly@@ rics are as an ver@@ bal @-@ view mirror of Al@@ ge painting .
nest@@ led them between the original @-@ Bible @-@ quoted by Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist who form@@ ulates here his personal thoughts on the situation .
the je@@ well@@ ery band has gold let@@ tering .
this 75 @-@ year @-@ old is equal to twice a deep sight into his soul , his emot@@ ions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
E@@ mot@@ ions were ulti@@ mat@@ ely trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and moved to Berlin in 1940 , comes from a family of protest@@ ant Protest@@ ant religious orders .
&quot; as the up@@ bringing with the cane was , she remin@@ ds of Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to destroy that , in order to re@@ cover me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second arrival is , the art in quick@@ er time again to more job value : &quot; perc@@ eption of imag@@ ination is influ@@ enced by Rek@@ l@@ ame , and that is no@@ isy .
Sym@@ bo@@ lic is thrown here .
artists have a different joy and del@@ ight , things to show .
have always some secre@@ ts and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Old said that the viewer in the pictures &quot; swe@@ at all &quot; let them rise , discover and feel the strength they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his back@@ side . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost particip@@ ates in the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; already being a lover since Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert art : &quot; I like how he under@@ stands with his images . &quot;
old did not keep it to record the Bible , but chosen for him , also myst@@ eri@@ ous topics .
&quot; it was no co @-@ operation on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the pictures , the text specifically made &quot; merely &quot; a picture of the Bible . &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to inv@@ ent his life and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
a piece of the origin@@ als - paper and screen shots - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation on November 15th .

at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all h@@ opes on a com@@ eb@@ ack of Marco Re@@ us finally cut final in the first group of the Europe League final .
the national player is missing the championship leader in the soccer le@@ ague in the Du@@ ell with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t re@@ tire at him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday .
if Re@@ us is on Sunday in the Bundesliga @-@ top match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ VB @-@ Coach handle left : &quot; we expect a return of him into the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of its high stress of his pro@@ s , tu@@ chel is not only changing its ancest@@ or position on the Re@@ us position .

Robot@@ ics autos : government wants a pioneer in Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany is supposed to be techn@@ ician in the future of the cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategic paper from the house of traffic authority Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which serves investment into the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday at Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ tional International Motor Show of a &quot; new mobile @-@ age age . &quot;
the automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic security and give less st@@ ats , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the topic , with his counter@@ part , consisting of the G7 , based on the IAA , also with representatives of the industry .
the strategy of the Austrian Ministry of Minist@@ ers emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band de@@ construction and a gener@@ ous circulation based on digital radio .
the test result of new technology is currently ar@@ ises a test route on the 9 in Bavaria .
thus , the German government will re@@ cover the legal framework conditions , &quot; I want to ver@@ ify the government &apos;s legal framework conditions and is where necessary to adap@@ t to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany is to set itself internationally that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h is raised .
the Federal Government also plans to use an amend@@ ment to the Vienna Convention , which now sees only the people as pilots .
when automated driving , the driver will take over the lead , driver will be more and more for passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and processing the data in seconds .
after a survey by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving to high@@ ways will be techn@@ ically possible by 2020 .
non@@ eth@@ eless , cars are still expected to be expected in public roads &quot; only far by 2020 . &quot;
the adjust@@ ments in the range of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features will appreci@@ ate the authors of the study by 2025 for about 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital net@@ working of the cars may lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic noise Sören Bar@@ to@@ l .
however , the question of liability in accid@@ ents and safety of the personal data of driver m@@ ute will be clear .
however , the Germans take self @-@ prop@@ elled cars however , sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more as French or Americans .
a study on Wednesday at the AA pre@@ set survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the D@@ sa Institute in order to transl@@ ate that only eight percent of Germans believe that aut@@ onomous cars come across the coming 10 years , 32 percent reck@@ on at all in the next ten years , and 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents compared to 2025 with aut@@ onomous parking in the US is 33 percent .
in Germany , the drivers in Germany are not willing to leave itself on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network BI@@ T@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent will be voices , control during the whole journey to all roads .
on the free@@ way , this could imagine that by 15 percent , at St@@ au 45 percent .
well , everyone would be able to over@@ leave the car control under no circumstances .

G@@ aul@@ tier fe@@ els good for an en@@ f@@ ant terri@@ ble
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax cra@@ y@@ figures : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , that can look human beings thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French design , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits into the big star of the fashion scene , so that he ro@@ de men at the Romans .
&quot; I can &apos;t say no more that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terri@@ ble of the Haute Cout@@ ure , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was fo@@ ols , in the meantime it was real , &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ Walk &quot; ( From Bür@@ g@@ erst@@ eig on the cat@@ walk ) , that is an luck in the Kunst@@ halle in the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion e@@ ast@@ ers has changed his initial attitude to a look at a show over his person .
in mind , because he had been a bit after death , he was a little bit after death . &quot; he said .
if you die , you &apos;ll come into the museum .
it was the impressive collection before , in the Canadian Montreal and Paris stop .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dress , &quot; said the director of the Kunst@@ halle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it go around tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits enter an in@@ sight into the very bad factory of man who wrote Mo@@ de@@ History , without ever a training .
chron@@ olog@@ ically the vision is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ o@@ grapher , for which much effort has been operated : to fr@@ ying the doll@@ s , for example , a styl@@ ist was hi@@ red for example .
according to the details of the Cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot &apos;s dimensions were bo@@ red for up to 14 tons of material .
shortly before the launch of the Oktober@@ fest was another special fire engine : a leather watch@@ man out@@ fit with cor@@ sets .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are poor as men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , said G@@ aul@@ tier .
also G@@ aul@@ ti@@ ers old t@@ eddy is able to see in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , many fashi@@ on@@ able fashi@@ on@@ able assist@@ ants of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student or bad in football ) he used his t@@ eddy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said G@@ aul@@ tier .
with one pupp@@ et to play , his parents could not be allowed him .
the design of fashion was then brought to himself later .
he did fashion fashion in@@ scrip@@ tions , and saw the designs of other designers , like G@@ aul@@ tier in Munich .
later , I then bought the course .
for his first own fashion show , he can &apos;t pay the models .
they conf@@ ess nothing , but they could re@@ tain the cl@@ ots .
Jewellery : Gard@@ ine - pl@@ unge tip as fashion @-@ N@@ ic
previously , it went to the long em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y in order to make pl@@ um@@ ps to make feet 100 meters .
the em@@ bro@@ idered material and tips were produced in large amount for customers that they were processed for example , ce@@ il@@ ings and curtain .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the mo@@ ury Pl@@ aces .
instead , the fashion is important .
in the starting time of the pl@@ au@@ ener tip he played a major role in which it gets lost through the home text industry - and is now considered N@@ ic re@@ discovered .
Rein@@ hardt lists some examples : tip in jewelry , with accessories such as pockets and for regional trails .
it is the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects an increasing sense of ti@@ met@@ ric@@ ally , increasing the potential of the potential .
those who have no interests in the textile branch in Germany , is no longer available on the market .
for us , they already make half of all orders .
together with nine further companies in the industry Association Pl@@ au@@ ener Ho@@ uses and Embro@@ i@@ der@@ ies .
only they are allowed to wear protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private business stores and also the wholesale accounts are almost no longer anymore .
our products can hardly reach our customers on this way .
the mass is now produced in the Asian region much che@@ aper and distributed almost exclusively through chains .
there is also we@@ aker , currently according to Russia and the United States .
so enough Reasons for the Way .
the industry association has also been trying to conduct environmental awar@@ eness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the sticker in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we lead a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ olog@@ ically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; it also refers to the used materials . &quot;
graduate engineer U@@ te Schmidt is instruc@@ ted at the Schnee@@ berger outside of the West @-@ Sax@@ on College of Zw@@ ick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in bro@@ ods and lace .
in order to discover the competition from the Asian region there is to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it needs time and cour@@ age .
there is a voltage range between the most fresh ideas of designers and the bed , who must think econom@@ ically , &quot; says Shi@@ res .
therefore , a existing design will often only be slightly adjusted to maintain a customer base .
some years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter designed the historic snow@@ eb@@ all in place from a few years ago .
stick@@ y the machine at some places little kit@@ chens .
the pl@@ um gold be@@ fell in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ ße took care of them : &quot; previously , I couldn &apos;t start with traditional pl@@ au@@ ts . &quot;
now she uses the snow strength for their jewelry .
in a el@@ abor@@ ate procedure the patterns pink in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
it also provides Finland in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially on customers whose ancest@@ ors have lived in Pl@@ auen , and en@@ vir@@ ons , and want to have a reminder .
that I see my je@@ well@@ ery as a modern am@@ bassador of the pl@@ au@@ ener .

it &apos;s about the experience of N@@ anny with the Ban@@ ks family in times of world economic crisis in England .

XI enters into the world , the economy far@@ es wide for the world
the economy has to open wider under the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , on Tuesday a group that was assigned by the Reform &apos;s steering system .
&quot; China should be used to improve foreign investment and know @-@ how policies and strategies for business reasons , &quot; he said in an address in the 16th session of Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform .
curi@@ osity to promote and re@@ forms of re@@ forms will result in new swing and vit@@ ality and offer new place for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the guide group has adopted a number of direc@@ tives , including a negative level on the provision of market policy , full @-@ controlled trials ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residents of the population .
after the statement , a negative level is created , all sectors and companies have not identified in question .
the system is tested and tested and by testing programs .
the initiative is of meaning that it pro@@ ves the market a major role in the locations by means of resources , a right @-@ state business environment , and aff@@ ir@@ med the market .
the government will also conc@@ ave to the companies of transferred to companies to ensure that the company will decide ha@@ ze their shops .
the statement also said that China will allow the limits to explore the new models of the cross @-@ border operation and new mechan@@ isms to promote regional growth .
as part of a offer , controlled sectors will open , further areas are opened for private investments .
&quot; the government will not change its politics due to foreign investments and impro@@ ving the law@@ ful inter@@ interests of fre@@ md@@ fin@@ anced companies and better services for them , &quot; said this statement .
moreover , it is made for fore@@ ign@@ ers simple to apply a permanent residence or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by appl@@ ying the requirements and application procedure simp@@ lif@@ y .
the law@@ yers to guarantee the law@@ yers to implement and professional judges and state law@@ yers , was also discussed at a session meeting too .

EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit value in smoking
the European Commission wants to double the limit value for mer@@ cury in large rough@@ mix@@ tures , bringing consumers to avoid a significantly higher dose of the nerv@@ ousness .
the consumer organisation Fo@@ od@@ ts , who is a corresponding working paper of the EU is critic@@ ised the plans for lack : &quot; risks and ad@@ verse events are contrac@@ ted with full W@@ an@@ ted g@@ orge to pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained by Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Fo@@ od@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt said to have the limit of nerv@@ es to large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from the economic reasons for a total of two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury in a kil@@ ogram of fish .
large rough@@ mix@@ tures exist already so strong with mer@@ cury , that , on the basis of the applicable limit , approximately 50 percent of the flies cannot be sold .
after double the limit , only 14.5 percent would then be short@@ ened .
in the counter , according to Fo@@ od@@ watch , the EU wants to distri@@ bute the limit values at other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram .
Fo@@ od@@ ts signed this but &quot; Tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller cem@@ fish such as car@@ p usually come so low that they are the planned maximum @-@ level values already today .
the down@@ feed in Mini@@ ature is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de support man@@ eu@@ ver that helps in the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mer@@ cury is one of the most highly toxic heavy metal metal , en@@ ligh@@ tened around the food chain particularly in space @-@ fish .
the Federal Government therefore war@@ ned that &quot; already small amounts are particularly with the n@@ atives of the nerv@@ ous system . &quot;
