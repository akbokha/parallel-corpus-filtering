the label on the box contains all the relevant specifications ( plant 4 ) registered data .
the normal Human Immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ in is a preparation of plasma proteins , which was made from human beings , anti@@ bodies of normal adult and whole blood .
the applied method has to ensure that the end product continues to be replaced below the terms of conditions and no in@@ oc@@ ul@@ atory od@@ ologies .
in addition , the anti@@ bodies must be foc@@ using on the product products in the product products in the product products .
the method is satis@@ fac@@ eted for each end@@ uring in this respect , if the anti@@ bodies and an bacter@@ ial tox@@ ins are tit@@ ized for at least one virus and an bacter@@ ial tox@@ ins .
while manufacturing may not be added any ant@@ is@@ ep@@ ic or bacter@@ ic@@ onic compound ; to ensure the bacter@@ ial ster@@ ility and stability of the end products , you can be added to a suitable preserv@@ ative and a suitable stabil@@ ization .

a re@@ agent of blood @-@ determination must re@@ act with all tested blood samples that contain the anti@@ bodies or another in the label @-@ given subst@@ anz hom@@ ol@@ og .
if a re@@ agent in the manufacturer recommended are used , the following factors , or appar@@ itions are not occur : a ) h@@ ash@@ ol@@ y@@ tic features ;
the T@@ iter is measured by always re@@ ten@@ tion of the test re@@ ten@@ tion to double in a suitable medium .
the T@@ iter is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the most strongest ser@@ um dil@@ ution in which a reaction is calculated ; the dil@@ ution is calculated only of the volume of blood @-@ body flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ation in the overall volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which are used on objects , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has been specified for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as ink@@ om@@ pl@@ ets anti @-@ D @-@ reag@@ ents , and for reag@@ ents of other specif@@ icity , and for re@@ agent of other specif@@ icity .
according to defin@@ ing , a international standard prepar@@ ative units contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is ir@@ respective of the tit@@ ers , which are observed in individual preparations for red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effic@@ acy of reag@@ ents for ble@@ eding @-@ determination of the specif@@ icity is expressed as Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ st@@ iter , which is observed in a series of dil@@ ution when er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes .
the T@@ iter gives the dil@@ ution of the re@@ agent in the last mix in a series , where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effec@@ tiveness of the reag@@ ents for ble@@ eding to ble@@ eding ( for the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as ink@@ om@@ pl@@ ettes anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of tit@@ ration of the un@@ identified recur@@ r@@ ence in international units ( See Bulletin , OMS , 1954 , 10 , 937 , 941 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .

if a re@@ agent among the manufacturers are recommended conditions , the required characteristics will remain at least one year long .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ essi@@ ger shape according to label is no one year after the last satis@@ factory effects .
this label is based on the label date for dry respon@@ dents , according to the results of durability tests ; it is appro@@ ve by state regul@@ atory authorities .
drying re@@ acts are kept in a atmosphere of iner@@ tia gas or in a vacuum tank , namely in the glass container , which they have been dried up and which is closed so that no moisture can be shut up .
a drying reaction must lose at most 0,5 v.@@ H of its weight , if it is due to more drying over phosph@@ or@@ pen@@ to@@ xy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
for avoid@@ ance of bacter@@ ial growth , the responsible state authority may be added to the re@@ agent ( or the respon@@ ses ) a ant@@ is@@ ep@@ tics and / or anti@@ biot@@ ics , if the re@@ agent with the published substance will continue to specif@@ ying specif@@ icity and effic@@ acy .

the reag@@ ents , in@@ valid , whether in flu@@ essi@@ v@@ ely form or after rest@@ ation , must be transparent , and may contain any se@@ di@@ ments of either G@@ els or visible particles .
as long as long as long as the international Convention is supposed to be coloured , as long as long until the international agreement has come to an un@@ ified system .
re@@ agent in the blood @-@ determination are in such a way and in such amounts , that the test methods are not only allowed to carry tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to conduct tests with positive and negative contro@@ ll blood cells .
in a container , this amount must be so large that the content should be used in this protocol that can be used in this protocol .
the production laboratory has over all production levels and controls of the reag@@ ents of blood @-@ specific records .
appropriate re@@ hear@@ sal samples are so long as long as the Labor@@ atorium , until with some prob@@ ability can be accepted that the b@@ atch is no longer used .
the respon@@ si@@ bilities of respon@@ ses cannot contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective ai@@ ds to rein@@ for@@ cement the effec@@ tiveness and preserv@@ ation of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups after the origin of its effective power .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin does not include any substance or plant re@@ agent of human origin .
on each single container a black printed label is made available in english and French language , the following information includes : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount of or , for dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the dis@@ solution is required ,
in addition , this label or label is located on cardboard , where the individual tanks can be included , or added the following instructions : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the amount of or , for dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the dis@@ solution is required ,
each con@@ sign@@ ment is to add a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention on this protocol .
