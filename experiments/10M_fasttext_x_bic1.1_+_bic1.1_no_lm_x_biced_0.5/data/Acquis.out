a concentrate of human blood cells is a unit of human solid blood , which has been removed from the largest part of the plas@@ mas .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit , which has been won ; other blood cells can be available , or can be partially removed .
the liquid level of the concentration is either from the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic eous solution which was added to the plas@@ mas .
the volume of red blood body should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume . however , the approximate percentage of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit ) is to be put on the label .

one of the liquid level , from which one went out at the production of plasma , relative water quantity is to use ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C .
an instant quantity of plasma is dissolved in the water quantity due to the liquid level , which has been produced ; the solution is sub@@ jected to the following tests :
II ) you need 1 ml solution to be a sufficient amount of TH@@ RO@@ MB@@ IN , or calcium chloride , this process can be acceler@@ ated in the brood @-@ furn@@ ace at 37 C .
due to the presence of drying in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pen@@ to@@ xy@@ d under a pressure of 0.02 mm mer@@ cury must not occur in the human dry plasma weight loss by 0.5 % .
human dry plasma is in a nitrogen atmosphere or in air @-@ empty space in a sterile room , in a closed bottle under the end of any micro@@ organisms and to protect any moisture ; it is light to protect and keep at a temperature below 20 C .
human Alb@@ um@@ in and fr@@ actions from human plasma are samples from the protein component , which consist of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the human perfection .
without rel@@ ate on whether the end product flu@@ essi@@ g or dry , the preparation after adding an appropriate stabil@@ izer in the final container should be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C , to de@@ activ@@ ate the removal of the In@@ oc@@ ul@@ ation@@ od@@ ologies .

the label on the box contains all the relevant specifications ( plant 4 ) registered data .
the normal Human Immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ in is a preparation of plasma proteins , which was made from human beings , anti@@ bodies of normal adult and whole blood .
the applied method has to ensure that the end product continues to be replaced below the terms of conditions and no in@@ oc@@ ul@@ atory od@@ ologies .
in addition , the anti@@ bodies must be foc@@ using on the product products in the product products in the product products .
the method is satis@@ fac@@ eted for each end@@ uring in this respect , if the anti@@ bodies and an bacter@@ ial tox@@ ins are tit@@ ized for at least one virus and an bacter@@ ial tox@@ ins .
while manufacturing may not be added any ant@@ is@@ ep@@ ic or bacter@@ ic@@ onic compound ; to ensure the bacter@@ ial ster@@ ility and stability of the end products , you can be added to a suitable preserv@@ ative and a suitable stabil@@ ization .

each con@@ sign@@ ment of reag@@ ents to blood @-@ group@@ ing is to add a certificate that they were produced according to the protocol of the protocol .
the protocol and its plant represent an administrative agreement , amended by governments of the contract parties to the Convention or compl@@ ements .
the contract parties make all necessary measures to provide the findings of other contract parties to blood @-@ group@@ ed from all input agreements .
it also will meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances are easily advanced in Article 3 of the recei@@ vers quickly and to go to the short@@ est way .
the contract parties refers to each other about the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe , a list of places that are presented in Article 4 .

a re@@ agent of blood @-@ determination must re@@ act with all tested blood samples that contain the anti@@ bodies or another in the label @-@ given subst@@ anz hom@@ ol@@ og .
if a re@@ agent in the manufacturer recommended are used , the following factors , or appar@@ itions are not occur : a ) h@@ ash@@ ol@@ y@@ tic features ;
the T@@ iter is measured by always re@@ ten@@ tion of the test re@@ ten@@ tion to double in a suitable medium .
the T@@ iter is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the most strongest ser@@ um dil@@ ution in which a reaction is calculated ; the dil@@ ution is calculated only of the volume of blood @-@ body flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ation in the overall volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which are used on objects , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has been specified for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as ink@@ om@@ pl@@ ets anti @-@ D @-@ reag@@ ents , and for reag@@ ents of other specif@@ icity , and for re@@ agent of other specif@@ icity .
according to defin@@ ing , a international standard prepar@@ ative units contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is ir@@ respective of the tit@@ ers , which are observed in individual preparations for red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effic@@ acy of reag@@ ents for ble@@ eding @-@ determination of the specif@@ icity is expressed as Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ st@@ iter , which is observed in a series of dil@@ ution when er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes .
the T@@ iter gives the dil@@ ution of the re@@ agent in the last mix in a series , where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effec@@ tiveness of the reag@@ ents for ble@@ eding to ble@@ eding ( for the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as ink@@ om@@ pl@@ ettes anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of tit@@ ration of the un@@ identified recur@@ r@@ ence in international units ( See Bulletin , OMS , 1954 , 10 , 937 , 941 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .
it comes back to a volume of 1 ml , so the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B S@@ lic@@ ate according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparation are free of charge of the international laboratory of laborat@@ orio for biological nor@@ ms of the World Health Organisation , Stat@@ ues Serum , Copenhagen , available .

if a re@@ agent among the manufacturers are recommended conditions , the required characteristics will remain at least one year long .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ essi@@ ger shape according to label is no one year after the last satis@@ factory effects .
this label is based on the label date for dry respon@@ dents , according to the results of durability tests ; it is appro@@ ve by state regul@@ atory authorities .
drying re@@ acts are kept in a atmosphere of iner@@ tia gas or in a vacuum tank , namely in the glass container , which they have been dried up and which is closed so that no moisture can be shut up .
a drying reaction must lose at most 0,5 v.@@ H of its weight , if it is due to more drying over phosph@@ or@@ pen@@ to@@ xy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
for avoid@@ ance of bacter@@ ial growth , the responsible state authority may be added to the re@@ agent ( or the respon@@ ses ) a ant@@ is@@ ep@@ tics and / or anti@@ biot@@ ics , if the re@@ agent with the published substance will continue to specif@@ ying specif@@ icity and effic@@ acy .

re@@ agent in the blood @-@ determination are in such a way and in such amounts , that the test methods are not only allowed to carry tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to conduct tests with positive and negative contro@@ ll blood cells .
in a container , this amount must be so large that the content should be used in this protocol that can be used in this protocol .
the production laboratory has over all production levels and controls of the reag@@ ents of blood @-@ specific records .
appropriate re@@ hear@@ sal samples are so long as long as the Labor@@ atorium , until with some prob@@ ability can be accepted that the b@@ atch is no longer used .
the respon@@ si@@ bilities of respon@@ ses cannot contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective ai@@ ds to rein@@ for@@ cement the effec@@ tiveness and preserv@@ ation of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups after the origin of its effective power .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin does not include any substance or plant re@@ agent of human origin .
on each single container a black printed label is made available in english and French language , the following information includes : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount of or , for dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the dis@@ solution is required ,
in addition , this label or label is located on cardboard , where the individual tanks can be included , or added the following instructions : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
