this document is a summary of the European Public Ac@@ t@@ ation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained , as the Committee for Human@@ arti@@ cul@@ ation Report ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to get through recommendations regarding the application of medicines .
if you need more information on your disease or their treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish more information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets ( tablets , which solve themselves in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 500mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening , or to@@ es of d@@ ingen , which are not present ) , mission I dis@@ order , a psych@@ ic illness , during which the patients man@@ ical episodes ( Peri@@ od of abnormal accum@@ ulation ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal tuning .
Ab@@ il@@ ify is used to treat medium to severe severe episodes of the treatment and prevention of man@@ ical episodes for patients who have been addressed to the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used to fast control of gest@@ ei@@ ger@@ ated un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral inter@@ ference , if the oral medication is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used to take the melting or melting tablets in patients where the sl@@ oth@@ ills of tablets may be processed .
in patients who use other medic@@ ations at the same time , the recommended dose should be adjusted by fl@@ il@@ ify .
this imp@@ aired the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of ner@@ ve cells .
Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol works probably mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in smaller sizes than the ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter has to activ@@ ate the recept@@ ors .
there is d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine with sh@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar inter@@ ruption to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain and norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , resulting psych@@ otic or man@@ ical symptoms .
the effec@@ tiveness of Ab@@ il@@ ify to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was investigated in three trials over up to one year .
the effec@@ tiveness of injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases that had increased to placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Ab@@ il@@ ify was compared to twelve weeks in 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the effic@@ acy of Ab@@ il@@ ify and placebo experienced in to 160 patients with which the man@@ ical symptoms had already been stabil@@ ized .
the effec@@ tiveness of Ab@@ il@@ ify injection solution was found in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar dis@@ order that suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ onic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of symptoms of patients from a standard scale for bi@@ polar dis@@ order or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
in addition , the company also led studies to exam@@ ine how the body produces the melting of m@@ elt and the solution to absor@@ b@@ ate ( decre@@ ases ) .
in both studies with the injection solution showed a significant stronger reduction in dos@@ es of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,75 mg or 15 mg , a significant stronger reduction of symptoms had increased am@@ less@@ ness than those who received a placebo .
during the treatment of bi@@ polar inter@@ ference , Ab@@ il@@ ify decreased more than placebo in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms .
Ab@@ il@@ ify prev@@ ented up to 74 weeks , more effective than placebo in previous episodes of previously treated patients and when it was administ@@ ered to an existing therapy .
dis@@ gener@@ ic inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg dos@@ es decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms gest@@ ed un@@ rest and were similar to effect as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common ad@@ verse events from Ab@@ il@@ ify to entrance ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , ada@@ che ( permanent motion ) , preserv@@ ation ( elev@@ ating production ) , preserv@@ ation ( elev@@ ating production ) , fatigue and fatigue ( elev@@ ating production ) , fatigue and fatigue ( elev@@ ations ) , fatigue and fatigue ( trouble ) , in@@ som@@ ni@@ ons ( sleep dist@@ urban@@ ces ) and an@@ xi@@ ety .
the Committee for Human@@ it@@ ating agents ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in the conclusion that the advantages of grav@@ ity at treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and severe episodes of a new man@@ ic epis@@ ode in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes about the treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , and opposite risk of risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in quick control of increased am@@ less@@ ness or in patients with man@@ ical episodes about Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order , if an oral therapy is not suitable for risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for placing Ab@@ il@@ ify in the entire European Union .
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of regular to severe episodes of the Bipolar I@@ - dis@@ order and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic epis@@ ode in patients , representing the greater episodes and their man@@ ical episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased effec@@ tiveness in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals than Mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effic@@ acy of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the Treat@@ ment of Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bipolar @-@ I@@ - dis@@ order in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with regard to larger sensitivity of this patient , a lower initial dose should be considered , if clinical factors are just@@ ify ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is set out of combination therapy , the Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icide behavior belongs to mental dis@@ orders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidem@@ i@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar dis@@ order no increased suff@@ ici@@ ency risk with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol is to be used with cau@@ tion of cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic dis@@ orders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ic diseases , conditions used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia pre@@ dis@@ pon@@ ing ( de@@ hydr@@ ate medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ ute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there was an important reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol .
when using ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , patients treated patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sp@@ y should be taken into consider@@ ation , the dose to reduce or to break the treatment .
if a patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or in@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manif@@ estation of m@@ ns have to be set to all non @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol was to be used in patients with cr@@ ev@@ angel@@ es in the An@@ am@@ nese or in circumstances which are used to be used with cau@@ tion .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had treated patients with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , an elev@@ ated risk of death compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relation between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted t@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ ose or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there is no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related events with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic effects of patients who allow direct distribution .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ uri@@ e , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weak@@ ness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monit@@ ored regularly in terms of contam@@ ination of the glucose levels .
a weight of weight will be observed in general in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ine patients and patients with bi@@ polar@@ ization , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , with which weight increased as a side effects , and could lead to severe comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol to the central nerv@@ ous system is instruc@@ ted when Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alised medication may be taken with over@@ flow ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , an gast@@ ric acid block@@ ers , reduces the Res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , but this effect is ir@@ relevant than clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D6 @-@ inhib@@ itor ( Chinese ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol to 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect another highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P2@@ D6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ in and par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects and therefore should be performed similar dose .
at CY@@ P2@@ D6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result the common application with high @-@ effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol compared to CY@@ P2@@ D6 .
when you exam@@ ine the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits must under@@ take the potential risks for the patients .
other highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors , you can do similar effects and therefore should be performed similar dose .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors , the dose should be increased from ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y on the dose of the accompan@@ ying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D6 , together with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a regular increase of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ or concentration .
in clinical trials showed no significant effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of CY@@ P2@@ D6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ meth@@ ox@@ ym@@ orph@@ an ratio ) , 2C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
in the patient should become not@@ ified , their doctor should become not@@ ice@@ able if they pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol .
due to the in@@ adequate data of security in humans and due to the re@@ productive studies at the animal , this medication should not be applied in the pregnancy , unless the potential is just@@ ified the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica should also be war@@ ned to use haz@@ ard@@ ous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are certain that Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol has no negative influence on them .
the following ad@@ verse events were more likely than placebo ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant ad@@ verse events ( * ) .
the frequency of the down@@ side effects are defined after the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks , treated with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ inson &apos;s and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % were treated with ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % were treated with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
Man@@ ic episodes for Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ ruption - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % were treated for patients under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol and placebo in which potenti@@ ally clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medical significant differences .
sal@@ aries of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general , tempor@@ arily and asym@@ pt@@ uning , were observed in 3.5 % of the patients with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol treated patients compared to 2.0 % of treated patients with placebo .
to the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic syndrome , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neu@@ ro@@ le@@ pt@@ ical syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie , and increased mortality in older dem@@ enti@@ a patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or ab@@ ak@@ y over@@ dose with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol alone was observed in adult patients with an estimated dos@@ es of up to 1260 mg and without any death sequence .
although there are no information about the effec@@ tiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ alys@@ is in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol . however , it is un@@ likely that her@@ o@@ int@@ se in the treatment of a over@@ dose of benefits , as Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol has a high plas@@ map@@ a .
it is thought that the effic@@ acy of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol to Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order concerning the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol showed high aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recept@@ or and a moderate aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , for alpha @-@ 1 ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and the Hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
gift from Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol in dos@@ es of 0.5 upto 30 m@@ g. once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dos@@ ing dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ recept@@ or lig@@ ences , on Nu@@ cleus cau@@ dat@@ us and am Put@@ ting .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ine patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a semi @-@ controlled trial in week 52 of the proportion of Respon@@ si@@ es in the study , one response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which have been defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - de@@ pression ratio , showed significant stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decl@@ ining rate , which was measured at 34 % in the Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol group and at 57 % below placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , mult@@ in@@ ational double @-@ blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia ( N = 18 or 13 % of evaluation processes ) in significantly fewer patients had a weight of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) in average weight of approx .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dose of over 3 weeks with a man@@ or or mixed Episode of the Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order , Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol showed a placebo over placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with a fixed dos@@ ing of patients with a man@@ or or mixed Episode of the Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order , Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol showed to placebo no over@@ le@@ ous effec@@ tiveness .
in two pl@@ ace@@ bo@@ - and active controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies of 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ or or mixed epis@@ ode of a Bipolar @-@ I dis@@ order , Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol showed a comparable efficiency compared to placebo in week 3 and an increase , comparable to lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol also proved an comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie to like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks of patients with a man@@ or or mixed Episode 1 , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol revealed a superior effec@@ tiveness in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms in comparison to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 weeks after a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 74 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks , the Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol showed to placebo over placebo over the prevention of a bi@@ polar combination , mainly due to the prevention of a feedback .
based on vit@@ ro studies are the enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D6 for el@@ ong@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ raz@@ ol , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is addressed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average elim@@ ination of Eli@@ min@@ ation life is nearly 75 hours for Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol with an extensive met@@ abol@@ ism of CY@@ P2@@ D6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism of CY@@ P2@@ D6 .
in Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic investigation did not be sex@@ ually dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics showed no indication on clin@@ ically significant differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ scrip@@ tures or the impact of smoke on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic features of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol was similar to patients with serious cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ol of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to pull sn@@ ap@@ shots on their met@@ abolic capacity .

Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of people , so they have only limited or no significance .
the effects converted a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent secondary counter@@ feit det@@ ects ( Lip@@ of@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment ) and an increase in secondary rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( equal rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10@@ fold in the recommended ste@@ ady state ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .
in addition , a factor of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol in the G@@ alle ranging from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day should be found at the recommended clinical use of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81@@ fold the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the human G@@ alle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of concentrated concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol is no more than 6 % of concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of vit@@ ro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar inter@@ ruption and behavi@@ oral inter@@ ference , the Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statist@@ ically significant improvement in symptoms of ag@@ it@@ ating and behavi@@ oral inter@@ ference compared to placebo and similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement from the output value on the PAN@@ SS exc@@ it@@ ement Comp@@ onent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for bay ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol .
in analyses of sub@@ group@@ ings in patients with mixed ag@@ it@@ ants or patients with severe ag@@ it@@ ants , a similar effic@@ acy in relation to the population was observed , but a statist@@ ical significance could be determined because of a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a semi @-@ controlled trial , 52 of the proportion of Respon@@ si@@ es in the study was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which have been defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ scale Scale , showed significant stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed a significantly higher reduction in the down@@ fall rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .

the effec@@ tiveness of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a study study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , of which about three quarters were previously received an Anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine .
the effect of ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in a few gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in combination with other drugs ( reducing the effects of effects ) .
in total , in the study study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included medicines .
consider only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between the effects of illness and survival . no difference between the disease and survival .
in contrast , people demonstrated in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast canc@@ els , in terms of these indicators that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane contained more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may not be applied for people , bre@@ ast@@ feeding or before the start of the treatment low Neut@@ ral phil@@ als in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ ar@@ z@@ nei@@ ge ( CH@@ MP ) determined that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane contained in patients with which the first treatment did not include more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , Medic@@ ines must not have to decrease any side effects in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Ab@@ ra@@ ci@@ ence Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited , approved a approval for transportation from Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who is missing the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not shown for a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( Neut@@ ral phil@@ ic value &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or serious sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y during the Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treatment should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
with sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y grade 3 , the treatment can be interrup@@ ted until an improvement of grade 1 or 2 , and at all the following cycles the dose will be reduced .
there are no align@@ ment data for the recommendation of dose adapt@@ ations in patients with mild to reduced imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with im@@ posing kidney function and there are currently no significant data to the recommendation of dose adapt@@ ations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of the kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of non @-@ sufficient data to un@@ inten@@ tion and effec@@ tiveness .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tik@@ el@@ form@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could be essenti@@ ally other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
when an allerg@@ ic reaction , the medicine should immediately be applied immediately , and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no renewed ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles would have increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function inter@@ ference ( bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / ALT &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly est@@ rogen with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was not detected , cardi@@ ac incid@@ ents are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in treatment or under@@ water , heart or lung disease .
if the patients are treated with the gift of absence of nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ biot@@ ics and constitu@@ tional funds .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane should not be pract@@ ised for pregnant or women in bo@@ iling age , who are no effective conc@@ eption for women , except for the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ handy .
women in bo@@ ost@@ ed age should be applied during and up to 1 month after treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , apply a reliable combust@@ ion method .
Male patients who are treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ es will be reviewed , during and up to six months after the treatment no child .
Male patients should make up before the treatment of a sper@@ ity preserv@@ ation , since the therapy with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects as fatigue ( very common ) and Schwin@@ n ( often ) that can rely on traffic light and ability to serve machines .
listed below are the most common and most important incid@@ ents of side effects , observed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated at piv@@ ot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 .
Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most remarkable important ha@@ em@@ ic tox@@ icity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and rapidly rever@@ si@@ bly and dos@@ es ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients and was short@@ ened in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , these ad@@ verse events are listed in conjunction with the gift of ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 789 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight loss , increased cre@@ atine in blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in blood :

since these events were reported on volun@@ tary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no connection with this events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a non @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active ingre@@ dient that supports mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the Tub@@ ul@@ in@@ dim@@ entation and stabil@@ ized mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhib@@ ition of their dep@@ ol@@ ymer@@ ic .
these stabil@@ ization leads to a inhib@@ ition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ ot@@ ical cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in the Trans@@ zy@@ tose of Plas@@ ma@@ components in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies it was characterized by alb@@ um@@ in the transportation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial transport due to the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ at@@ rez@@ ept@@ or is used due to the alb@@ ying binding protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic in C@@ yst@@ eine ) , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the area of the tum@@ ors .
application of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two in@@ hum@@ bled studies and from 454 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with ab@@ ra@@ x@@ es , which was given in a form of inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second trial a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centre study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were obtained in the form of solv@@ ents of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ medication such an allerg@@ ic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the survey conducted in the study 64 % of the patients had a imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had real metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ plates .
14 % of patients had not yet received chemotherapy , 27 % had only received an ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % for metast@@ ases , and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and to ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to pro@@ gression and pro@@ gression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who are &gt; first @-@ line therapy are depic@@ ted down below .
ne@@ ur@@ otox@@ icity to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by impro@@ ving a degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy a periph@@ eral re@@ rop@@ ath@@ y grade 3 was evaluated .
the natural course of periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y to Bas@@ eline on bas@@ eline on bas@@ eline of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not evaluated according to &gt; 6 treatment courses and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was identified in clinical studies .
linear capacity ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 167@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analogue of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift from Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration in multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant distribution of distribution and / or sof@@ ten@@ ment of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours were compared to intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of de@@ vi@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearing of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) as a sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies of human liver mic@@ ros@@ ome and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abol@@ ished and two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was the average value for cum@@ ul@@ ative ur@@ inary tract of 4 % of the given dose of 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
over the age of more than 75 years , however , only a few data available , since only 3 patients were participating in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic analysis .

• Scho@@ ols brochure • summary of the Charac@@ terist@@ ics ( speci@@ alised information ) , lab@@ elling and pack @-@ included . • With unique representation of the correct use of the product shown cooling systems for transportation through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicines is similar to the European Union ( EU ) and the same substance ( also called &quot; reference ar@@ z@@ nei@@ ge &quot; ) .
in patients with normal blood ir@@ regul@@ atory values , in which related to a blood trans@@ f@@ usion of comp@@ lications , if the surgery could not be able to expect a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be conducted under the supervision of a physician &apos;s supervision in the treatment of patients with conditions that is indicated for the drug .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to take a self @-@ ble@@ eding blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
injection can also be made by the patient or of the sch@@ olar@@ ship , unless they received a reasonable instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney failure , respectively , patients receiving chemotherapy should always be observed in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per day of adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are able to control the treatment to ensure that no iron level consists of iron , and ice@@ able dis@@ sol@@ vent should be given during the treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems can be caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or thereby that the body is not sufficient for the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell which was brought into a gene ( DNA ) , which is capable of formation of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was observed in administration as injection in a major study with 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems , compared with reference ar@@ ches .
all participating patients had been inj@@ ected in at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected before they were converted either on Ab@@ se@@ amed or still E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effic@@ acy was the change of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es between the beginning of the study and the period period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who were treated at one through kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es of patients who received on Ab@@ se@@ amed as against those patients who continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients showed that E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , occasionally to symptoms of an enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like su@@ dden , ste@@ war@@ den mig@@ rant he@@ ada@@ ches and conf@@ usion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed cannot be used by patients who may possibly be in@@ sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection of the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems because further studies are necessary to ensure that there are no allerg@@ ic reactions .
the Committee for Human@@ it@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in the conclusion that the medic@@ ations made a comparable quality , safety and effic@@ acy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , created by Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on the medical professionals in all Member States , including information on safety of medicines .
in August 2007 , the European Commission awarded the Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines of P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , approved a approval for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .

the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for bag@@ gage patients who should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome and fol@@ klore can vary depending on the age , gender and total disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and health disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ b@@ ins to more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avo@@ ided over a period of four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients can occasionally be observed in one patient &apos;s individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ able levels or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ocular concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ value is increasing by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa intake is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monit@@ ored regularly , to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , in the lowest approved dose , which is necessary for controlling the an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ mi@@ es@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low heat value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher yield strength than patients where initial cycle is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .

An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome and - Fol@@ ded methods may vary depending on the age , gender and total disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and health disease is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be monit@@ ored regularly , to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is necessary in the lowest approved dose which is required for controlling the An@@ ci@@ ym@@ pt@@ omas .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries have risen by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the ret@@ ic@@ ul@@ oid value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once per week should be ret@@ ained .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones ) both women after the exchange years as well as in men .
it is applied in patients with a high cargo risk ( bone breaks ) , including those who have had a lower h@@ omet@@ imes like H@@ inf@@ all . • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone , a disease that changed the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus pag@@ an should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment . patients with r@@ ump sum should be obtained from the first inf@@ usion to a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ections in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflamm@@ ation ) just after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms after the inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and he@@ ada@@ ches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can only be pres@@ cri@@ bed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingre@@ dient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was attracted to the rating of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study nearly 8 000 el@@ derly women with ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis was involved , and it was examined the number of ver@@ te@@ br@@ ine and stro@@ kes over a period of three years .
the second study consisted of 2 127 men and women with ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a h@@ ump sum over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared to Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) .
the main indication for the effic@@ acy was , whether the sal@@ ary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme based on bone subst@@ itution ) decreased to at least 75 % compared with the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of anti @-@ frac@@ tures were under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cal ) over a period of three years , compared to placebo by 70 % .
in comparison to patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ at@@ edi@@ ente ) , those under placebo was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with h@@ ats , 9 % of patients in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a cargo correction ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients in placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the inf@@ usion , and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who may have a sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ atas in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is a risk of cardi@@ ac trials and ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( cr@@ abs by bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a represents a clar@@ if@@ ications for doctors who prepar@@ es A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the treatment of ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who would be explained to the side effects of medication that should be explained to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited , approved for the transport of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the entire European Union .

for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis and ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men , intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic h@@ ats , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after operating expenses ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be pres@@ cri@@ bed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long re@@ is@@ ance period was observed in patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 m@@ g. of elem@@ entary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic h@@ ug , a initial dose of 50.000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ bit or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Inf@@ usion .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by using Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen short after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney disease ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ atine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because limited clinical experience for these patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of all older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adol@@ esc@@ ents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for appl@@ ying children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under the age of 18 because data is missing and effec@@ tiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with serious cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because for this patient &apos;s population only limited clinical experience .
an existing hyp@@ oc@@ al@@ ley at the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is sufficient to treat calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the fast inser@@ ting of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid can develop a tempor@@ arily , with sympt@@ om@@ atic Hyp@@ ok@@ al@@ z@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate supply of calcium , according to at least 500 m@@ g. of elem@@ entary calcium , ensure at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer Disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ on@@ ero@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be taken in front of an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate pre@@ venti@@ ve dental care .
for patients who need fertil@@ izers , no data available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the pine range .
clinical assessment due to the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of one patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced through gift from Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen short after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the prev@@ alen@@ ce of than serious side effects reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 852 ) .
in the ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to placebo between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , essential ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drugs effects are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al inter@@ ference Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been used with kidney disease , which were used as a decrease in ser@@ um cancer ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cancer patients ) and in rare cases reported as an ac@@ ute re@@ inst@@ ances .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ inine Clear@@ ance ( measured on the administration of administration ) and the occurr@@ ing of cardi@@ oid function were comparable in a clinical study of ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of treatment was observed in 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients with placebo was observed from 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory studies the temporary asym@@ pt@@ om@@ atic calcium values that were below 21 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies were treated .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis in the study to prevent clinical fre@@ igh@@ ts@@ men after a r@@ ump sum and in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ing clinical fre@@ igh@@ ts@@ ons , the vitamin D levels were not standardi@@ zed , however , the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the inf@@ usion of infection , swe@@ aring and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the Kiev area of occas@@ ions , especially at Kre@@ b@@ sp@@ ati@@ ans , about ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the Kiev area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had the signs of local inf@@ ections including ost@@ e@@ omy@@ el@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer medicines or other dental attacks .
7 study with 7,@@ 736 patients re@@ signed ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the j@@ aw area near a patient with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and treated with placebo in a placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of over@@ dose , which leads to an clin@@ ically important hyp@@ oc@@ al@@ emia can be achieved through an evaluation of calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effec@@ tiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( PFT ) The effic@@ acy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once per year was observed in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 736 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density or a BM@@ D @-@ T Score for Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing ver@@ te@@ ens correction .
Eff@@ ects on mor@@ ph@@ omet@@ ric S@@ omet@@ ric acid A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a significantly reduced over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new cycl@@ ones ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients with over 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of cycl@@ ones compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) .
effects on stro@@ kes of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a proved an equal effect on three years , which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reducing the risk of r@@ ump sum .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lo@@ op@@ ic acid , r@@ ump and in the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 increase the bone density of lum@@ ber sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the total r@@ ump sum by 6.0 % , of the she@@ ds around 5,1 % and dist@@ al radius around 3.2 % .
Kno@@ en@@ hist@@ ology has been treated with 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ ot@@ hic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the bas@@ eline .
a micro@@ computer con@@ denser ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase of tr@@ endy bone volume and the content of tr@@ ab@@ ul@@ ars bone architecture .
bone tumor mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 517 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odi@@ c intervals throughout the study .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly increased by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
b @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value to 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were non @-@ rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the inf@@ usion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D in total and bu@@ ck@@ les to all periods .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.4 % of the total amount and 4.3 % at the closing price .
clinical effic@@ acy in Men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized to 508 men and evaluated the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical fre@@ igh@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical cargo cultures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) the once @-@ annual administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was related to the percentage change of the L@@ act@@ ition@@ ist BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effic@@ acy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years , especially light until moderate Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone tumor ( mean ser@@ um @-@ mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,0@@ fold @-@ specific upper normal mean value in the study ) .
11 The effec@@ tiveness of a inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of comparison studies .
after 6 months , the combined results achieved a similar integration of pain and pain influ@@ ences compared to the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified into a post@@ operative study on the end of the six month study ( on the therapy ) , could be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who treated the therapeutic check in 141 of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 71 the patients with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , compared with the average duration of follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Ac@@ cur@@ acy Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained , as the Committee for Human@@ arti@@ cul@@ ation Report ( CH@@ MP ) has implemented the conducted studies in order to access recommendations regarding medication .
Ac@@ tos is applied for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can not be displayed in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abet@@ ic medicine ) is not shown together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ drug ( Du@@ al@@ Ther@@ apy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which can not be used with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose , not satis@@ factory .
in combination with a sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ material or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fur treatment can be ret@@ ained , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ p@@ yl@@ har@@ sh or the ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body ins@@ ulin is better imp@@ acted and the blood glucose levels can be adjusted , thereby reducing the type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the effic@@ acy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ a therapy was investigated ; in addition the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ p@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant , additionally it received for up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cer@@ os@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates that the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos resulted in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value that it might be close to the blood glucose levels of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ th@@ ic study demonstrated the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values in a decrease of 0.35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin studied in 289 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to placebo in addition to placebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were vision@@ aries , inf@@ ections of the upper re@@ spir@@ atory symptoms ( reduction ) , weight loss and hy@@ po@@ aest@@ hes@@ ia ( di@@ min@@ ished sensitivity to irrit@@ ate ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients , may not re@@ act or in@@ sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) opposite Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency or di@@ abet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ osis ( high her@@ etic levels - ac@@ id@@ ol mirror - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients , is not shown in which Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited , approved for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white and white , round , curved and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar with ins@@ ulin in@@ adequate or un@@ toler@@ ability is not appropriate ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years no data available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ are heart disease ) , the doctor should begin to begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight increasing or oil can be observed , particularly those with a reduced car@@ di@@ aler reserve .
the patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac failure , weight increasing and oil can be observed when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardi@@ ov@@ ascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was performed under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing ordinary loans .
in this study showed an increase in reports on cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency , but not to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver cells ( ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
if the ALT @-@ Spiegel up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are increased , the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers are as soon as possible .
if a patient symptoms developed on a hep@@ atic d@@ ys@@ function , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , digest@@ ive , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued , should be led to the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ si@@ cally dependent weight increase , which can be prev@@ ented by fat deposits , and in some cases with a fluid connection is connected .
as a result of a prison@@ er at the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a lower reduction in the medium hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ar values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oplast@@ ies ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed with compar@@ ative controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ b@@ ins at 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ b@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the elev@@ ated ins@@ ulin sens@@ ity consists of patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale dual or triple combination therapy with sulph@@ u@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ material or as dual - combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ si@@ cally hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch with Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ it@@ ones , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , including a det@@ eri@@ oration or a det@@ eri@@ oration of a di@@ abet@@ ic mac@@ ular d@@ ems with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity was reported .
it is un@@ clear if there are no direct connection between the gest@@ ion of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ular dro@@ ple@@ t if patient should report about dis@@ rup@@ tions of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ olog@@ ic declaration should be considered to be considered .
in a sum@@ mar@@ ized analysis of messages from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients , treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
the calculated fr@@ actions @-@ incidence amounted to 1.9 fr@@ actions per 100 patient &apos;s patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fr@@ actions for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the PRO@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years for study of cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events , freight rates of 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ k@@ structures per 100 patient years ) compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ k@@ structures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
the patient should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient excl@@ ude a pregnancy or those who enter the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for the investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmac@@ odynam@@ ics by Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ olic cou@@ ma and met@@ form@@ in .

when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day after seven days there were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation of specific core recipes ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) with rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PAR @-@ γ ) , which leads to an elev@@ ated ins@@ ulin sens@@ ity of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton muscles .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ reproduction in the liver and periph@@ eral inj@@ ury in case of ins@@ ulin @-@ resistance .
a clinical study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ az@@ id as Mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investig@@ ate the time until the therapeutic effect of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment course ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients among gli@@ cl@@ az@@ id ) .

Aden@@ u@@ ric is applied for patients who have already been used to transfer cryst@@ als , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in joints ) or pl@@ aster ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater ur@@ at@@ cryst@@ als that can result in joints and bone damage ) .
when the har@@ ns@@ ant view is still about 6 m@@ g. a day , the dose may be increased at once daily 120 mg .
during the first treatment course we can still occur increasingly ; it is recommended that patients under@@ take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ u@@ ric even more medicines to prevention of g@@ aining cases .
it is not recommended for children and patients who had a tran@@ splant@@ ation , since it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study where 1 0@@ 72 patients participated in the first study , the effic@@ acy thir@@ ds of different Aden@@ u@@ ric dos@@ es ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) received with a placebo ( apparent media ) and compared to Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ con@@ k@@ emia ) .
in the second study two dos@@ es of Aden@@ u@@ ric ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day .
the main inde@@ k@@ ator for the effic@@ acy was the number of patients whose har@@ ns@@ ac@@ ic mirror was in the blood of the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the Aden@@ u@@ ric in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who took a daily 120 mg , with the last three measurements an har@@ ns@@ ant mir@@ rors in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) in patients with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no one of the 134 patients with placebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Aden@@ u@@ ric ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ che , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea and abnormal liver values .
in particular , in patients with heart failure in pre@@ historic times , possibly a increased risk of determination of ad@@ verse events that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ ar@@ z@@ nei@@ ge ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in the conclusion that Aden@@ u@@ ric was more effective in blood more than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of ad@@ verse events in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ con@@ leu@@ k@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ings ( including one of them &apos;s history or present incid@@ ents and / or a summit ) .
if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ yl mirror is still in 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , can be considered a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe non @-@ functional restri@@ ction , the effic@@ acy and safety was not completely examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adol@@ esc@@ ents . there is no experiences yet with children and adol@@ esc@@ ents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
tran@@ spl@@ ants for tran@@ spl@@ ants , there is no experiences yet with tran@@ splant@@ ation , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease occurs in patients with isch@@ a@@ emia heart disease or de@@ kom@@ pen@@ sive heart failure , the treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ ns@@ ant medicines , it can occur during the treatment in the beginning , because by the lo@@ wering of the ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ ac@@ ic mirror , which initially can be mobil@@ ized in the tissue .
b . in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ i Ny@@ han syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the ur@@ ine occur in rare cases , that it comes to a deposits in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease during clinical studies of phase 3 were observed with a slight decrease of liver function with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3,5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform in front of the Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ e@@ ology and further development depending on the clinical power and a liver function ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ oph@@ yl@@ lin Z@@ was no inter@@ acting study to Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the XO inhib@@ ition can lead to a rise in the@@ oph@@ yl@@ axis ( a inhib@@ ition of the met@@ abol@@ isation of The@@ oph@@ yl@@ lin also reported for other XO inhib@@ itor ) .

the lo@@ wering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ Acid mirror on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the physician &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently ret@@ ained throughout the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um canc@@ er@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with non @-@ functional limit@@ ations The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effec@@ tiveness in 40 patients with ren@@ al restri@@ ction ( i.e. h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary effects point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clinical significant differences regarding the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ ant concentration in subjects , un@@ specified their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ ant concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and FAC@@ T study ) had a ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ ant concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
in two years , the open extension study of the open extension study showed that the permanent lo@@ wering of the incid@@ ents showed that less than 3 % of patients hosp@@ ital@@ ization required ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a cast @-@ type ) .
this was associated with a reduction of gyp@@ sum height , which in 54 % of the patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the pal@@ aces up to the month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received in the open @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface area under the plasma concentration camp ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at according to administration and multiple dos@@ es of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tional .
for dos@@ ing dos@@ es between 120 mg and 300 mg , the AU@@ C is observed , larger than the dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tional increase is observed .
after taking easier or multiple dos@@ es of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,3 µg / ml .
however , no clinical significant change in the percentage decrease of ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ ant concentration was observed , if this was tested ( multiple dos@@ es of 80 mg ) .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used for the treatment of ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease where the bones ro@@ ast ) is used for women after men@@ op@@ ause , which consists of a low vitamin D levels .
the female has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or any other drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) .
to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may take place until after the first dietary intake of the day that will take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 will already be used apart from each other in medicines that are registered in the European Union , the company dis@@ posed dates from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 682 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis in relation to the effec@@ tiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in terms of vitamin D @-@ reflection .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with a low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively alkal@@ ine ( 32 % ) .
the company also made data before that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common ad@@ verse events ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , pain of movement ( muscles , bones or joints ) , gl@@ omer@@ ation , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( blast@@ ing ) , gl@@ oss@@ ils , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie ( Schl@@ u@@ ck@@ les ) , sp@@ ati@@ ated ab@@ d@@ omen ( broken belly ) as well as Sau@@ res .
in patients with precise over@@ sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other constitu@@ ents , AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE may not be applied .
it must not be applied to dis@@ orders of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low levels of calcium ) or in patients who do not stand for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink , or take medication ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ ant ) for the day .
the following indic@@ ations are exactly to follow , to decrease the risk of ös@@ oph@@ ag@@ ic irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should be applied after the day of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 mL ) . • The patients shall not let the tablet to be broken in the mouth , because a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ ale Ul@@ man@@ a is supposed to take place before taking the first food intake of the day that will take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ tical Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal ble@@ eding or surg@@ eries in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only under special cau@@ tion ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ ously Ero@@ c , rarely followed by ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al cor@@ k@@ structures , were reported in patients suffering from al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( some were these seri@@ ously bad@@ ly and required a hosp@@ ital@@ ization ) .
the doctor should therefore be atten@@ tive to all signs and symptoms that are pointed to possible effects of symptoms such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain of pain or a new or ru@@ bb@@ ing heart burn the medicine and medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe serious side effects seem to be increased in patients who did not take the drugs correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that occur on a ös@@ oph@@ ag@@ ic Ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions are given to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
during large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after market ) Mag@@ en- und Du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some serious and comp@@ lications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ ros@@ is of the Kiev , usually in connection with an dental extrac@@ ting and / or a local infection ( including ost@@ e@@ omy@@ el@@ itis ) , whose therap@@ ies was mainly administ@@ ered intra@@ ven@@ ously .
there are no data available to indicate whether the re@@ placing of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ ry in patients who require a cold surgical procedure , reduces the risk of ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is of the pine .
clinical assessment due to the treated doctor is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the patient should be demonstrated that they should take advantage of the dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE by taking the tablet in the next morning after having noticed their failure .
they are supposed to take two tablets on the same day , but taking of a tablet per week as originally planned for the planned day .
other diseases containing the mineral changes ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE therapy before the beginning of the therapy .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale medicines can be affected by Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
the patient must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron at least 30 minutes before it will take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ ventions studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually pres@@ cri@@ bed medication , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to apply while using the pregnancy .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at do not allow access to directly damage effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ e@@ bo@@ xed studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily more than 2 years and then 10 mg daily will continue to be obtained either by 1 or 2 years ) :
during this study , the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at showed a rise of 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % vs placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
re@@ trac@@ tive re@@ trac@@ ting to a intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of age@@ ron@@ at at women 0.@@ 64 % for dos@@ es between 5 and 70 m@@ g. after proximity of a standardis@@ ed break@@ fast@@ s and two hours before recording of a standardi@@ zed breakfast .

in ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ est@@ u@@ ums , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if there was at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers conducted the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) to none clin@@ ically significant change from al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron is distributed according to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg ( tempor@@ arily distributed ) divided into the bones or di@@ vor@@ ced in the bones or di@@ vor@@ ced by the ur@@ ine .
differenti@@ ation After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active mark@@ eted substance were re@@ signed within 72 hours by ur@@ ine and no radio activity .
according to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and system@@ ic clearing was not 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at will not be elim@@ inated above the aci@@ dic or bas@@ ic transport system of kid@@ neys and therefore , it is not assumed that it influ@@ ences the differenti@@ ation of other medicines through this transport systems .

differenti@@ ation when using radio@@ active mark@@ ers of vitamin D3 , the average separation of radio@@ activity in ur@@ ine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the subjects after 4 days 4.9 % .
characteristic in patients pre@@ clinical studies showed that the proportion of al@@ um@@ ron@@ at which is not stored in the bones , quickly separated on the ur@@ ine .
although no clinical data is provided , however , it is to calculate that the ren@@ al Eli@@ mination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at will also be reduced in patients with limited cardi@@ oid function .
therefore , patients with limited ren@@ al function can expect a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ ag@@ raf is administ@@ ered adult patients whose kidney disease was tran@@ splant@@ ated to prevent a tran@@ spl@@ ant of tran@@ spl@@ ant Organ@@ s through the immune system .
da Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has already submitted the results from previously implemented studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ splant@@ ation , whereby the use of Adv@@ ag@@ raf is compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator of the effic@@ acy was the number of patients where tran@@ spl@@ ants after a treatment duration of one year was deduc@@ ted ( by example , how often had a re@@ use tran@@ splant@@ ation or restoration of the di@@ alys@@ is required ) .
in addition , more recent studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney tran@@ splant@@ ation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ splant@@ ation and studied as Adv@@ ag@@ raf is included in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft .

doctors who are interested in immune diseases and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ants such as medic@@ ations should apply or changes in immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
based on clin@@ ically rele@@ asing differences of system@@ ic ex@@ position of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can result in tran@@ splant@@ ations or to an elev@@ ated incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immune system .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and respective daily dosage ; circumstances of form@@ ulation or reg@@ imes should only be performed under the m@@ esh@@ y control of one in tran@@ spl@@ ant medical insurance ( see section 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a change to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic dose monitoring and corresponding dose custom@@ iz@@ ations must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic ex@@ position of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the Adv@@ ag@@ raf should appear in first line on clinical assessment of abstr@@ act and toler@@ ability in detail and ble@@ eding ( see below &quot; recommendations
after upgr@@ ading from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks should be carried out prior to conversion and two weeks after change@@ over .
in day 4 the system@@ ic ex@@ position was measured as a valley view , comparable to both form@@ ul@@ as well as well as le@@ ber@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley view is recommended during the first two weeks after Tran@@ splant@@ ation in Adv@@ ag@@ raf , to ensure appropriate substance ex@@ position in the immediate after@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , a adaptation of Adv@@ ag@@ raf dose can take several days to reach the Ste@@ ady State .
if the condition of patients in the first post@@ operative phase no oral medication may be made intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate on the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of approx .
duration of the application for de@@ pression in tran@@ spl@@ ants , the immune system must be sustain@@ ed ; however , a maximum duration of the oral therapy is not reported .
dose highly recommended - kidney tran@@ splant@@ ation - The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning .
other dos@@ es may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us could change within the stabil@@ isation of the patient after tran@@ splant@@ ation .
dose recommended - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yl@@ axis of gra@@ ft medication should start with 0.10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning .
dose recommended - change@@ over by Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf &apos;s a tran@@ spl@@ ants of daily dose to one time daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf is converted to a time daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf , thus avoid@@ ing this conversion at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , to be carried out on the whole daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant after a conversion of other immun@@ o@@ res@@ si@@ va at Adv@@ ag@@ raf once daily must start the treatment with each in kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ants for proph@@ yl@@ axis of tran@@ spl@@ ants .
heart tran@@ spl@@ ants in adult patients who received in Adv@@ ag@@ raf is an oral initi@@ ation of 0,15 mg / kg / day once daily once in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ants with Adv@@ ag@@ raf in lung cancer , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ m@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant patients occurred in an oral initi@@ ation of 0,10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day , with pan@@ cre@@ ting patients in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patient with registered liver function for maint@@ aining blood levels in the dist@@ or@@ ated area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function inter@@ ference .
patients with restricted kidney function Da the kidney function is no effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be out that a dose adaptation is not necessary .
due to the Nep@@ hr@@ otox@@ ic Pot@@ enti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful surveillance of cardi@@ oid function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um ha@@ em@@ in@@ ic mirror , a calculation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ ar@@ ance and a monitoring of the ure@@ a ) is recommended .
change@@ over of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ag@@ raf At the conversion of a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ - based on a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is instruc@@ ted ( see section 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
refer@@ end@@ ous to the valley of mirror in the whole blood The dose should be based on clinical assessment of abstr@@ act and toler@@ ability in detail under the help of full @-@ tac@@ tical Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror .
it is recommended common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley view during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ants , followed by peri@@ odi@@ cal controls during re@@ ten@@ tion therapy .
tac@@ tical view mirror of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be possible to change by pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , dose modi@@ fication , changes of immune medication , which could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood levels ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjust@@ ments the dose of several days to enter the Ste@@ ady State .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley is not exceed the blood level of 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley view of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is usually in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and a heart tran@@ spl@@ ant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent re@@ ten@@ tion therapy of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ants were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to severe un@@ wanted events , including tran@@ spl@@ ants , or other side effects , which can occur in a row of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and respective daily dosage ; circumstances of form@@ ulation or reg@@ imes should only be performed under the m@@ esh@@ y control of one in tran@@ spl@@ ant medical insurance ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft shock , which had proven itself against other immune supp@@ ress@@ ors , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
for proph@@ yl@@ axis of tran@@ spl@@ ants in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ants and tran@@ spl@@ ants in childhood there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
due to possible exchange @-@ effects , which can lead to a tac@@ tile levels of blood and a f@@ atten@@ u@@ ation of clinical effect , the cur@@ rant herbs ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant hal@@ ves during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ fel@@ - concentrations provided in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels have been sub@@ jected to such circumstances .
in rare cases under pro@@ gra@@ f a car@@ di@@ omy@@ opathy re@@ called chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ emia which can also be found in Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
further factors which increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ orders , a treatment with cor@@ on@@ ero@@ ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney , or liver function , inf@@ ections , fluid flow loading and oil .
like with other immun@@ o@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sun@@ light or UV light should be restricted for the possible risk of skin against appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection factor with a high protection factor .
when patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as he@@ ada@@ ches , changing consci@@ ousness condition , forces and visual inter@@ ference should be a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.g. ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ raf &apos;s dur@@ ations , ret@@ ar@@ ed , lac@@ tose is contained in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary Gal@@ ac@@ tose @-@ Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz , L@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ ac@@ tose @-@ Mal@@ y special incid@@ ent .
simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines referred to as a Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can increase the met@@ abol@@ ism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ cular level of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A met@@ abol@@ ism , to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maint@@ aining accurate concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
the interaction with An@@ tim@@ y@@ kot@@ ika , such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , i@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and pre@@ icon@@ az@@ ol and the Mac@@ ro@@ lid anti@@ biot@@ ics Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ ease ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ sights studies revealed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the elev@@ ated bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to inhib@@ ition of gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal det@@ ects , resulting .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in case of ac@@ ute symptoms , increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower .
the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itor . therefore , simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abol@@ ised by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose met@@ abol@@ ism are affected by met@@ abol@@ ism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us re@@ placing the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ ce@@ al and thus reducing the hormon@@ e ex@@ position , is especially c@@ auti@@ ous for decisions concerning receiving measures .

Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( a lack of factor VIII con@@ te , inn@@ ate ble@@ eding mind ) .
the dosage and frequency of use is due to whether Adv@@ ate is applied for treatment of ble@@ eding or prevention of surgery in surg@@ eries .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from VIII deficiency , which causes ble@@ eding problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plasma , but it is known as a &quot; re@@ combination DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell which was brought into a gene ( DNA ) , which allows it to formation the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a different defined benefit from the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , is similar , however , this medication has no protein human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of medication was investigated for prevention of blood and surgical inter@@ ventions .
in the main study , the effec@@ tiveness of Adv@@ ate for prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new ble@@ eding , with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good &quot; rated .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , he@@ ada@@ ches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may possibly be more sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse - or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted a approval for the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG to transport Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage : dos@@ ing and duration of the subst@@ itute therapy according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ Mang@@ el , after the place and the extent of blood cells and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following co@@ ag@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients with 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat , until the pain and the pre@@ y imp@@ air@@ ment are elim@@ inated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat , until the risk of patients passed over .
during the treatment , the controller is to be administ@@ ered to control the dose and incidence of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma level .
individual patients can be distingu@@ ished in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and different half @-@ times .
3 proph@@ yl@@ axis for long @-@ term proph@@ yl@@ axis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given dos@@ es between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. by factor VIII per kg of weight .
if the expected factor VIII can &apos;t be reached , or if the ble@@ eding is not ruled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if required a inhib@@ itor .
in patients with high inhib@@ itor values it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be weigh@@ ted .
the appointment speed should be addressed according to the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing anti@@ bodies ( inhib@@ itors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A treatment .
this inhib@@ itors have always been modified against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma .
the risk of developing inhib@@ itors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position days of the largest , and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ position and an@@ am@@ nest@@ y inhib@@ itors , after the implementation of a re@@ combined factor VIII @-@ product on another that were observed ( lowest ) inhib@@ itors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ oph@@ ilia A in women lie with factor VIII during pregnancy and still life .
in the largest number of patients tre@@ ating A@@ DR@@ s were inhib@@ ited against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) that had risen to a higher risk to education of inhib@@ itors , he@@ ada@@ ches ( 5 patients ) , fever and Schwin@@ n ( 3 patients ) .

based on the first release of the data of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has continued to evalu@@ ate the benefits risk reduction , but has been considered a positive effect , but the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monit@@ ored :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has required on the basis of safety profile of AD@@ VA@@ TE , which makes a sub@@ mission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided to apply a further extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular was officially activated by the Committee for Human@@ ar@@ z@@ nei@@ ge ( CH@@ MP ) that the company &apos;s request for permission granted by Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , bone or the soft parts ( tissue , which connects the other structures in the body , re@@ lies and supports ) of it .
this is a kind of virus , which has been transformed that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
at the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in this is a &quot; Aden@@ ovirus , &quot; which was so al@@ tered that there is no copies of itself and therefore cannot dis@@ solve in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is made out of which is not def@@ ective in the human body of the p@@ 53 @-@ gene , is usually contri@@ butes to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein has not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow up and share .
the company made data from a study involving a patient before the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ mining , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP &apos;s respon@@ ses to the company had been reviewed issues , some questions were un@@ explained .
based on the ex@@ am , initially submitted documents the CH@@ MP to Day 120 a list of questions which will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not suff@@ ici@@ ently proved that injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ours benefits for the patient .
the committee also had re@@ conc@@ ern regarding the processing of medicines in the body , the type of administration and the safety of medication .
in addition , the company had not suff@@ ici@@ ently proved that Adv@@ ance can be made in a reliable way that it is neither for the environment for people who come in en@@ low contact with the patient are harm@@ ful .
the CH@@ MP is not included in knowledge if the withdraw@@ al consequences for patients who currently participated in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed active ingre@@ dient means that the tablets are thus composed as follows that one of the most effective components immediately and the other slowly over some hours away .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is used for treatment of the se@@ asonal allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis ( Heus@@ chn@@ u@@ cking ) by an all@@ ergy against P@@ ollen inflamm@@ ation ( n@@ oses ) in patients with rhin@@ estones ( linked nose ) .
for adults and teen@@ agers over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ ina@@ ze twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the treatment time should be as soon as possible and fin@@ ishes , as soon as the symptoms , especially the vul@@ ner@@ ability of the nose and nose .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of medication may be stored on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the efficiency measures , the changes of the sever@@ ity bar@@ riers were reported by Heus@@ chn@@ u@@ pf@@ ym@@ pt@@ ors that were reported from the patient before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a di@@ ary , and evaluated the symptoms in the last 12 hours .
in consider@@ ation of all Heus@@ chn@@ u@@ pf@@ ym@@ pt@@ ors except the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who received Aer@@ ina@@ ze , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in the patient who received pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine alone .
when only the vul@@ ner@@ ability of the nose was considered , the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7,4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in the patients who alone ass@@ essed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , t@@ ank@@ y@@ car@@ es ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , de@@ grad@@ ation , he@@ ada@@ ches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ni@@ ons ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , som@@ eb@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep fri@@ es ) , sleep dist@@ urban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ os@@ ze may occur in patients who may possibly very sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ in or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ al active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicines for the treatment of aller@@ gi@@ es ) are not used .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze may also be used in patients used to prevent hyper@@ tension ( high blood pressure level ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ th@@ y@@ re@@ ose ( over@@ function of th@@ y@@ ro@@ id ) or already caused a h@@ ash@@ an rh@@ age ( caused by a brain ble@@ eding ) or a risk of lim@@ iting rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe Company approved a approval for the transport of Aer@@ ina@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is g@@ rie@@ ve in the lan@@ ces ( i.e. without them to break or to break down ) .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should be used because of the absence of data on the un@@ inten@@ tion and effec@@ tiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not to be used in children under 12 years .
the duration of application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after gradu@@ ation of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days , as long as long @-@ term use , the activity of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine can be abol@@ ished .
following the decline of grinding of grinding in the upper re@@ spir@@ atory for the treatment when needed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as Mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ ina@@ ze Pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ in , it is also contra@@ sted in patients with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhib@@ itors are treated or within 2 weeks after termination of a therapy .
this is based on alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ ine , such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ o@@ rid , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Erg@@ ot@@ amine , Di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , Phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ hedr@@ in , Oxy@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , N@@ aph@@ az@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and effec@@ tiveness of these combination therapy were not checked and the data are not sufficient to arrange the recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and effic@@ acy of Aer@@ ina@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data are not enough to discuss the recommendations to the dosage .
the patients must be informed that the treatment with a hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ at or of P@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or nau@@ gh@@ test neurolog@@ ic symptoms ( like he@@ ada@@ ches or a rein@@ for@@ cement of the he@@ ada@@ ches ) must be removed .
in the treatment of patient groups : • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ sters ru@@ ction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ nese .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of the mat@@ ological tests , because Anti@@ hist@@ amine is otherwise positive response to indicators for skin reaction or reduce their extent .
in addition , clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been administ@@ ered , however , no clin@@ ically important inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ ot@@ or@@ ic tests there were no significant differences between the associated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken .
it is not identified for the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible , so that interaction with other drugs will not be excluded .

the imm@@ unity of use of Aer@@ ina@@ s during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ anci@@ es , however , no increase of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to normal population .
since re@@ productive studies of animals not always be transferred to humans and are not applied to the v@@ as@@ ok@@ on@@ stri@@ ctor &apos;s properties of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ in should not be applied in the pregnancy .
however , the patient should also be clar@@ ified that it may occur in very rare cases , which can cause a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic light or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS de@@ pression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ min@@ ished spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardi@@ ov@@ ascular coll@@ agen ) and a z@@ NS stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , preserv@@ ations ) with possible let@@ tering .

it took 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with season@@ ally allerg@@ ic rhin@@ oc@@ itis , with 414 patients of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist effic@@ acy of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets , determined based on the tot@@ ality of symp@@ tom ( except rhin@@ oc@@ lassi@@ fication ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ hedr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effec@@ tiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets in terms of flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ous effect , was determined significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .

clinical trials in various indic@@ ations , including allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opat@@ hic Ur@@ tics , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more ad@@ verse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events of ad@@ verse events were reported on Plac@@ ebo than in placebo ( 1.2 % ) , oral disease ( 0.8 % ) and he@@ ada@@ che ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 578 jug@@ end@@ ous patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common ad@@ verse of he@@ ada@@ che , treated in 5.9 % of the patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and treated with placebo in 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , which have given up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( n@@ in@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically important effects were observed .
this includes both inhib@@ ition of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human rec@@ tile cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhib@@ ition of the expression of the ad@@ vent@@ ure@@ ment of end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple sclerosis in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dos@@ ing of up to 20 mg daily more than 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically important cardi@@ ov@@ ascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) over ten days , showed no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls .
at a single dos@@ ing study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of the air@@ ing performance , including sub@@ j@@ ective cel@@ ess or tasks that are connected to the fig .

in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , an allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of symptoms can also be divided in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis and persist@@ ent allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ent allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as based on the situation in the quest@@ ionn@@ aire at the Rhin@@ o business administration , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the se@@ asonal @-@ allerg@@ ic rhin@@ itis .
chronic idi@@ opat@@ hic Ur@@ tics has been examined dep@@ end for further forms of Ur@@ tics , since the under@@ lying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology remains similar to the different forms and chronic patients can easily be recru@@ ited .
since the hist@@ amine presence has been a cause factor in all ur@@ on@@ auti@@ ous disease is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin apart from the chronic idi@@ opat@@ hic Ur@@ tics is also leading to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical control lines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opat@@ hic Ur@@ tics , A@@ eri@@ us could be effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the form of squares at the end of the first dose intervals .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. the Committee for Human@@ it@@ arian pr@@ uning ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company &apos;s request for permission granted by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 flu in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect the protection against influ@@ enza , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special kind of vacc@@ ine that could cause a future p@@ andem@@ ic in front of a future p@@ andem@@ ic .
a influ@@ enza p@@ andem@@ ic breaks out when a new tribe of flu influ@@ enza can be dil@@ uted by man , because people don &apos;t have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) .
according to administration of vacc@@ ine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the immune system contained in the vacc@@ ine contained in the influ@@ enza &quot; body and forms si@@ RNA against it .
this allows the immune system to form a fast antibody in contact with a flu virus .
afterwards , the membrane cover of the virus caused by the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that det@@ ect the human body as a body , det@@ ect ) and used as an ingre@@ dient of the vacc@@ ine .
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this resulted in the scope of clinical data basis for evalu@@ ating safety of the vacc@@ ine , to ful@@ fil the requirements of the EMEA region for pre@@ p@@ andem@@ ic vacc@@ ines .
if you need to participate in a clinical study and require further information on your treatment , please contact your previously untreated doctor .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medication for the treatment of adults and children over four years applied to the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency disease type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which caused the inher@@ ent Imm@@ une De@@ fic@@ iency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot kill the capsules as a solution for income , but this can &apos;t be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir because the safety of this combination was not studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be classified , if the doctor has been checked , having taken an an@@ tivir@@ al drug of the patient before the patient has to be judged so that the virus will be adjusted to the drugs .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , together with twice daily 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medication .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ag@@ it@@ ase aims to body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medication , the HIV @-@ amount is reduced to the blood and keeps it at a low level .
Aids is not he@@ al to he@@ al AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system and thus preventing the development of HIV connected inf@@ ections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medication , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , in two major studies with 736 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously not been treated with prot@@ ease .
with low dos@@ si@@ bly R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , the medic@@ inal product of medic@@ ations has been taken up for 206 adults , who previously taken the former prot@@ ease of prot@@ ecting .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effic@@ acy , the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV ( vir@@ al load ) or the change of vir@@ al load after the treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhib@@ itor , however , after 48 weeks , more patients had a vir@@ al load of 400 copies / ml as under placebo , but atro@@ phy was less effective than In@@ din@@ av@@ ir .
in children , A@@ generation decreased the vir@@ al load , but with the children that had been treated with prot@@ r@@ ack@@ ers , only very few on the treatment were treated .
in the study with adults , previously treated with prot@@ ease of problems , the vir@@ al load is the vir@@ al load after 16 weeks of treatment the vir@@ al load is just as effective as other prot@@ ease :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors , it came under ag@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir together with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir to a stronger waste of the vir@@ al load after four weeks , taking their existing prot@@ ease .
the most common ad@@ verse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ che , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( break@@ down ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , skin irrit@@ ation and f@@ ables ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase can not be used by patients who may possibly be in@@ sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir or any of the other components .
apart from the patients may not be applied to patients , the cur@@ rant herbs ( an herbal agent for the treatment of de@@ pression ) or drugs , which are the same as medic@@ ations and are benef@@ ic@@ ial in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as in other medication against HIV ( HIV ) , the risk of li@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in distribution of body fat ) , an ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( cr@@ ying of bone tissue ) or a imm@@ in@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection which causes a relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Human@@ ar@@ z@@ nei@@ ge ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ Gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication used to determine the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic amplif@@ iers of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , but the committee was determined that the benefit of ag@@ it@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in patients who did not have been taken a prot@@ ec@@ tom@@ y .
as@@ o@@ asis was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , since the time of approval for scientific reasons is only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited , approved for regional transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years now .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ic capsules of am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir can be administ@@ ered together with low dos@@ es of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir should apply taking into consider@@ ation of the individual vir@@ al resistance pattern and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the Bi@@ over@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as a solution for income is less than 14 % less than Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as capsule ; therefore , A@@ generates capsules and solution to intake a milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams of basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir twice daily together with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication .
2 If o@@ as@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fication of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( Boo@@ ph@@ olster@@ y ) must be used to be used higher dos@@ es of ag@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics , effic@@ acy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low dos@@ es of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir or other prot@@ r@@ ack@@ ers were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to un@@ inten@@ tion and effec@@ tiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ an data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function inter@@ fer@@ ment is reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with mild or regular liver function with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ sted ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase can not be given at the same time with medication that have a low therapeutic width and also subst@@ rates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the cur@@ rant herbs ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , may not be used due to risk analysis and di@@ min@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be pointed out that A@@ sur@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy were not to be a healing of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic inf@@ ections or other comp@@ lications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment with aspect gases does not reduce the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
as@@ su@@ ase capsules together with low dos@@ es of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication should be used ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer chronic hep@@ atitis B or C suffering from a anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , an increased risk for heavy liver lo@@ wers with a potenti@@ ally f@@ atal course .
for the case of an current an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read more information about this drug .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis show an increased frequency of liver function under a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monit@@ ored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other gl@@ uk@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , it is not recommended that the potential benefits of treatment in system@@ ic cor@@ on@@ ec@@ tic effects including Mor@@ bus c@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the secondary function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the conf@@ usion of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itor Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended for simultaneous risk of my@@ opat@@ hi@@ es including R@@ hab@@ at@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standard Settings ) , methods to determine the effects of the drug concentration .
in patients who can take this drug at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be reduced as much as Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir below ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abol@@ ism , Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir can be changed the effec@@ tiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ sts , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction .
if Meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , the patient should therefore be monit@@ ored on Op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ pt@@ ors , in particular if there are also low dos@@ es of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ y@@ col@@ col@@ ouring of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take care of children under the age of four years , it should be used to be used for certain other people groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 5 when a skin irrit@@ ation of system@@ ic or allerg@@ ic symptoms will be accompanied or the grinding of grinding ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ ease inhib@@ itor , has been reported via diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ er@@ b@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , whose therapy were necessary to be used with the development of a type of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer and@@ au@@ ern@@ de anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic dis@@ orders .
in h@@ ag@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease ( type A and B ) , reports about an increase of ble@@ eding including spont@@ aneous k@@ ut@@ ans hem@@ at@@ ome and her@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
in the time of HIV @-@ infected patients with serious immun@@ isation therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ inflamm@@ ation therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflamm@@ ation or resi@@ du@@ al opport@@ un@@ istic inf@@ ections , which leads to severe clinical trials or det@@ eri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a Multi@@ fact@@ orial treatment is assumed ( including use of cor@@ on@@ ero@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ otherapy , higher body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combinations ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 subst@@ rate with low therapeutic width of A@@ generation can not be given at the same time with medication that have a low therapeutic width and also subst@@ rate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D6 subst@@ rate with low therapeutic width of ag@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir cannot be conf@@ used together with medication , whose active ingredients can be conf@@ used over CY@@ P2@@ D6 , and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical approach and resistance development .
with an attempt to balance the serious plasma level by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , often have been observed often un@@ wanted effects of the liver .
JOHN &apos;S W@@ ORT ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ m@@ iter mirror of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir can be har@@ vest@@ ed by simultaneous preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taken by Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ian mirror , and if possible , add the vir@@ al load to ver@@ ify the loc@@ ust .
a dose custom@@ ization for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ av@@ ir is administ@@ ered along with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see also ep@@ fav@@ or@@ ence below ) .
it is a 508 % increase , if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered in combination with am@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg twice daily , with the effic@@ acy and safety of this treatment sch@@ emes .
52 % if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is a close surveillance , because the effic@@ acy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study to use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ az@@ ids component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase lies at least one hour ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore the gift of E@@ fav@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose is required .
the treatment with sequ@@ enti@@ a in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ av@@ ir is not recommended because the ex@@ position of the prot@@ ease would be har@@ vest@@ ed .
the effects of Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ in , based on other prot@@ ease , and existing dates have been avo@@ ided that Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ in could possibly be sunk in the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
if this drug should be used simultaneously , cau@@ tion must be instruc@@ ted because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma glucose levels could be less effective .
if this medication should be applied together , the cau@@ tion is instruc@@ ted ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , because a precise pre@@ diction of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is difficult to be difficult .
simultaneous use of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in plasma concentration of 193 % and thus at an increase with R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in connected effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is necessary to provide a reduction in dose of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , however , the plasma level of both pharmac@@ euticals could be increased .
simultaneous use of 700 mg f@@ os@@ amp@@ ir and 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir once a day led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day , compared to 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir once a day .
other drugs , which are listed below , among them also subst@@ rates , inhib@@ itor or induction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ ov@@ ase , possibly lead to inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be associated to toxic reactions , associated with these medicines are monit@@ ored , if they are used in combination with A@@ ov@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as A@@ ov@@ ase , as it can be re@@ productive dis@@ orders .
simultaneous use of anti @-@ vul@@ si@@ as , known as enz@@ ym@@ eter factors are known ( Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir can lead to a lower plasma level of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
the ser@@ um concentration of cal@@ ci@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , im@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ od@@ pin , N@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase 10 through Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , making it increase activity and tox@@ icity of this drug .
simultaneous use of A@@ ov@@ ase can increase its plasma concentrations in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhib@@ itors , ad@@ verse events including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , tend@@ encies and Pri@@ ap@@ ism reinforced ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ de@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma was significantly decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % condens@@ ed interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , it is not recommended using as@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir together with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir together with these gl@@ ac@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , it is because the potential benefits of a treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ on@@ ec@@ tic effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends materials strong from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinc@@ tive ex@@ termination of the plasma level in the equivalent administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
the plasma level increases this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a induc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itors to My@@ opathy , including R@@ hab@@ at@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined use of this drug with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is not recommended .
it is recommended to stabil@@ izing the therapeutic concentration until stabil@@ ization of the mirror , because the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may be increased ( see section 4.4 ) .
hence , A@@ gener@@ ase not may be used together with oral form@@ ul@@ ary Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while using an example of ag@@ ost@@ atic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am inten@@ tion .
data for the current use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors have a possible increase in plasma level by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to the 3 @-@ 4 @-@ distance .
if Meth@@ ad@@ on is administ@@ ered along with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , the patient should therefore be monit@@ ored on Op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome , especially if there are also low dos@@ es of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
because of the only low reliability of historical Compare , no recommendation can be given as any recommendation , as the Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is administ@@ ered at Meth@@ ad@@ on if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is administ@@ ered at Meth@@ ad@@ on .
for the same @-@ time gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , together with A@@ ov@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International normal@@ ities ratio ) is recommended due to a f@@ atten@@ u@@ ation or gain of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir on hormon@@ al contrast is not expected , therefore alternative methods are recommended for conc@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ ypt@@ il@@ in ) is recommended at the same @-@ time gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy only after the pregnancy , this drug may only be used after risk of the potential for the mother in comparison to the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ tic rats , Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir kept in breast milk .
a reproduction study of imp@@ air@@ y rats which was given at the end of Sh@@ eri@@ us to the end of the bre@@ ast@@ e@@ era of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight of income .
the further development of the after@@ mat@@ ernity including fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir on the mother .
ag@@ gression of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied with adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication .
most of the ag@@ ost@@ atic tre@@ ating effects connected effects were slightly up until moderate , and rarely used to therapy .
with many of these events , it is not clar@@ ified if they are used in connection with the in@@ gest@@ ion of A@@ gener@@ ase or another simultaneously for HIV treatment , or whether they are planning a result of the cru@@ cial disease .
most of the bottom @-@ side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , which were not pre @-@ treated patients of 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) that were evaluated by the audit in connection with the study medication were evaluated and performed by more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a distribution of the body fat ( li@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fine fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ie of bre@@ asts and dor@@ sal fatty acids ( st@@ ier@@ n@@ acken ) .

the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M at ac@@ ute inf@@ ested cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic cells .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir / 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily : N = 107 ) treated with prot@@ ease of treated patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure about 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease @-@ mut@@ ations at :
on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance monitoring systems , analyses of the activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir can be applied to patients with prot@@ ease @-@ resistant insulation .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ a / V , I@@ 62@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M combined with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and a reduced prob@@ ability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
concl@@ usions on the relev@@ ance of particular mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ ell can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to move the current inter@@ pret@@ ations for analysis of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ical resistance regul@@ ating analyses clinical valid@@ ating systems can be used in conjunction with the genetic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in patients with prot@@ ease @-@ resistant insulation .
firms , distribut@@ ing diagnostic resistance tests , have clin@@ ically @-@ ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( isol@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be applied to the interpretation of an resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir associated pattern creates a certain cru@@ cial resistance against R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , the sensitivity against in@@ din@@ av@@ ir , Nel@@ fin@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ av@@ ir remain in general .
there are currently data on cru@@ cial resistance between Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and other protective advis@@ ers for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients ( one of which the resistance to Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( three of 25 ins@@ ur@@ ks ) , In@@ de@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 insulation ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Tip@@ ran@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( four of 24 insulation ) .
re@@ vers@@ a , Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir maint@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant insulation ; the content of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations to isol@@ ates isol@@ ates .
the early break of a dis@@ si@@ ent therapy is recommended to keep the pro@@ lifer@@ ation of a variety of mut@@ ations in bound@@ aries that may affect the following treatment .
in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg twice a day based in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( N@@ RTI ) or a standard of therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with an PI , mainly with lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir &quot; received .
a hundred and six@@ ty @-@ six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with a weigh@@ ted virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI , and at least one N@@ RTI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ differenti@@ ation of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma to 16 weeks in plasma , with a non @-@ sub@@ sid@@ y threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of effec@@ tiveness of un@@ parall@@ eled atro@@ phy is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was obtained in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was not a low do@@ si@@ ged R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir simultaneously ; the majority of patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients had received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a median increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared with the initial value .
19 Bas@@ ed on this data was to be considered to be considered an expected benefit of &quot; un@@ parall@@ eled &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) until the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , for C@@ max which decreased by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) was given .
administration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir 12 hours after dos@@ ing ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) of the food intake remained un@@ influ@@ enced by the food intake and influ@@ enced the extent and the rate of re@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to about 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and it can close to a large volume of penetration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir from the blood circulation .
this change leads to a decrease in total concentration in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which remains the active ingre@@ dient probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir constant remain constant during the percentage of free active ingredients during the dos@@ ing intervals in the ste@@ ady state on the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is to induc@@ ed or in@@ ating or in@@ sist@@ ence or a subst@@ rate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , which will be given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the treatment of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice a day or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ex@@ position as with adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is a solution of 14 % less bi@@ od@@ able than out of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generates solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ graph basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble , therefore the effect of a kidney disease is relatively low for elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
these treatment sch@@ em@@ ata lead to Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir @-@ plasma welding comparable to healthy subjects according to a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir twice daily without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily .
in long @-@ time studies for the pul@@ pit and rats at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ ome for dos@@ es on those who have a 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8- fold ( rat ) of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emer@@ gence of hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ ome has not been clar@@ ified and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects of people is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data in humans , both of clinical trials as well as from therapeutic use , however , however , some evidence for the assum@@ ption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro test tests , the bacter@@ ial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ation test in human periph@@ eral l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor con@@ otox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monit@@ ored in clinical daily life by measurement of AST , ALT and the activity of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , clinical trials was observed no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
studies to the tox@@ icity at young , treated at a age of 4 days , showed both high mortality in the control of the control and amp@@ ire treated animals .
in a system@@ ic plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected ex@@ position among the therapeutic dosage , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ us@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and less@@ er sk@@ el@@ age changes were observed on a del@@ ayed development .
24 If o@@ as@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fication of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( Boo@@ ph@@ olster@@ y ) must be used to be used higher dos@@ es of ag@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with weak or easier liver function with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ sted ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standard Settings ) , methods to determine the effects of the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 27 when a skin irrit@@ ation of system@@ ic or allerg@@ ic symptoms will be accompanied or the grinding of grinding ( see section 4.8 ) .
an enhanced risk for li@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer and@@ au@@ ern@@ de anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic dis@@ orders .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical approach and resistance development .
it is a 508 % increase , if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered in combination with am@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is a close surveillance , because the effic@@ acy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with sequ@@ enti@@ a in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ av@@ ir is not recommended because the ex@@ position of the prot@@ ease would be har@@ vest@@ ed .
if this medication should be applied together , the cau@@ tion is instruc@@ ted ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , because a precise pre@@ diction of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is difficult to be difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is necessary to increase in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is required .
the ser@@ um concentration of cal@@ ci@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , im@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ od@@ pin , N@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , making it increase activity and tox@@ icity of this drug .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ de@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma was significantly decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % condens@@ ed interval 82 to 89 % ) .
for the same @-@ time gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , together with A@@ ov@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International normal@@ ities ratio ) is recommended due to a f@@ atten@@ u@@ ation or gain of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,0@@ 35 mg Eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir to 22 % .
during pregnancy only after the pregnancy , this drug may only be used after the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of imp@@ air@@ y rats which was administ@@ ered by the in@@ ating in the U@@ ter@@ us until the end of the bre@@ ast@@ e@@ era of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , showed a reduced increase in body weight at the coming time .
ag@@ gression of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied with adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication .
in case of a over@@ dose , the patient is considering an in@@ tox@@ ication ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support of supporting measures .
an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in both ac@@ ute and chronic l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as also the periph@@ eral blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ ute inf@@ ested cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
re@@ vers@@ a , Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir maint@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant insulation ; the content of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations to isol@@ ates isol@@ ates .
based on these data , it should be considered to be considered an expected benefit of &quot; un@@ parall@@ eled &quot; A@@ Gener@@ ase in Bet@@ ting with PI .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir constant remain constant during the percentage of free active ingredients during the dos@@ ing intervals in the ste@@ ady state on the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is to induc@@ ed or in@@ ating or in@@ sist@@ ence or a subst@@ rate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , which will be given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble ; therefore the effect of a kidney disease is relatively low for elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
in long @-@ time study of the law with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in mice and rats met hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ omas of dos@@ es on which the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8- fold ( rat ) of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
the under@@ lying mechanism for the emer@@ gence of hep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ul@@ ars Aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ ome has not been clar@@ ified and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects of people is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data in humans , both clinical trials as well as from therapeutic use , however , some evidence for the assum@@ ption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro test tests , the bacter@@ ial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse l@@ ymph@@ oma test , micro @-@ core and chromos@@ ome test in human periph@@ eral l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor con@@ otox@@ ic .
studies to the tox@@ icity at young , treated at a age of 4 days , showed both high mortality in the control of the control and amp@@ ire treated animals .
these results indicate that the met@@ abol@@ ism are not fully stretched out , so that Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir or other critical components of the form@@ ulation ( z .

the benefit of using R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir &quot; ge@@ bo@@ ost@@ ed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution was not treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the Bi@@ over@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as a solution for income is less than 14 % less than Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as capsule ; therefore , A@@ generates capsules and solution to intake a milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams of basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should soon as soon as they are able to kill the capsules , taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ o@@ asis is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medication , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there is no dosage recommendation for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and then low dos@@ ing R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir can be avo@@ ided to this combination with these patient groups .
although a dose custom@@ ization for Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is not necessary for use , an application of ag@@ itation solution for inser@@ tion in patients with kidney dis@@ orders ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk provis@@ ion@@ ing of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ y@@ col@@ col@@ mer@@ it is A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take care of inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , with pregnant liver function or liver re@@ vers@@ ations and patients with kidney disease .
the simultaneous administration can lead to a compet@@ ent inhib@@ ition of the met@@ abol@@ ization of this drug and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects like heart rhyth@@ ms ( z .
the patient should be pointed out that A@@ sur@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy were not leading to a healing of HIV infection and continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic inf@@ ections or other comp@@ lications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment with aspect gases does not reduce the risk of 47 transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .

it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical approach and resistance development .
it is a 508 % increase , if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered in combination with am@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous use of A@@ ov@@ ase can increase its plasma concentrations in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhib@@ itors , ad@@ verse events including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , sights and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on the 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .

the cream is dil@@ uted before bed@@ time zones on the affected skin surfaces , so they have sufficient for long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before they washed .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to placebo ( same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ding in the gen@@ ital area for 16 weeks .
the main indication for the effic@@ acy was the number of patients with full healing of treated haz@@ ard . • Al@@ dar@@ a was studied in 724 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated with six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either a day or five times a week .
the main indication for the effic@@ acy was the number of patients with full healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo in all four major studies ranged from 15 % to 52 % with placebo @-@ treated patients , but only 3 % to 18 % of patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .

if the follow @-@ up exam@@ inations 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period of treated stores only in@@ complete , one other treatment should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should carry the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therap@@ ist plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream is dil@@ uted in a thin layer , and in the pu@@ rified skin zones that is fully covered up to the cream .
it should be carried out in these patients a des@@ ir@@ ation between the benefit of an treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk of their auto@@ immune diseases associated with their auto@@ immune diseases .
in case of these patients there should be a reduction between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and with a possible organ@@ izer or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .

there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the poor and hands support the effec@@ tiveness for this application , therefore it is not recommended such a such application .
local skin actions occur frequently , but these reactions take normally back to intensity in the course of intensity or after setting of therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream .
if the local skin @-@ actions of the patients may cause great dis@@ inf@@ ections , or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
from the data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 types of re@@ stores have a lower full healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .

in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s caused the G@@ ag concentration in the ur@@ ine around 60 % , and half of treated children had a normal liver on the end of the study .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ che , nau@@ sea , stomach pain , pain in li@@ mb@@ al ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion .
very frequent side effects under five years old , increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dio ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fever and bulk frost .
in patients , al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s may not re@@ act more sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction ) , not used .
each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year all new information that may be known , testing and update these summary .
in fact , the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s is preserved to observe the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s , regarding the reactions to the Inf@@ usion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. an approval for the transport of al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a combination form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using a combined DNA technology using CH@@ O m@@ am@@ mal cell@@ ular cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ arian of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
in patients Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s is in@@ treated for patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) , to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ic manif@@ est@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s should be provided by a doctor in treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient could reduce this , all 15 minutes in single steps will be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and effic@@ acy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effic@@ acy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency was not determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended dos@@ ing scheme .
patients with al@@ dur@@ ym@@ s treated patients can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as a related side effects that occurs during the inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also be fully monit@@ ored , and the inf@@ usion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s should only be provided in an appropriate clinical environment , in the re@@ bel@@ ting facilities for medical emerg@@ encies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , we expect nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibody against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment course .
patients who develop antibody or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated by al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as much experience concerning recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , must be careful because of the theoretical increased risk @-@ action after a reduction of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of the Inf@@ usion with medic@@ ations ( Anti@@ hist@@ amines and / or Anti@@ py@@ re@@ tik@@ a ) to minim@@ ize the potential inf@@ usion related reactions .
in case of a light or medium @-@ severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ amines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should rep@@ ay and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on half of the inf@@ usion rate when the reaction has occurred .
in case of single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction needs to be stopped , until the symptoms were brought to the decline , a treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ amines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
inf@@ usion can be taken up with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate when the response has occurred .
3 ( Anti@@ hist@@ amines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate , which entered the previous reaction .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Pro@@ ca@@ in , because a potential risk of inter@@ ference is treated by lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not run directly or indirect effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
because there is no data in new@@ born , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , is recommended to kill during treatment with al@@ dur@@ ym@@ s .
the effects in clinical trials were classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , who were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in study participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted drugs actions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s , while the phase 3- trial and their extension in a total of 45 patients were observed in the following table : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with serious M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper re@@ spir@@ atory symptoms and l@@ ungs in the pre@@ historic times , even heavy reactions proceed , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , re@@ spir@@ atory and fac@@ ial ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted drugs effects in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s , while a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with pre@@ domin@@ antly heav@@ ier form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are reported in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , it came within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ oc@@ on@@ ous version , with a heav@@ ier ver@@ ification form mostly in a month to a ser@@ oc@@ on@@ ist ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
by the end of the Phase 3 trial ( or until the present out@@ breaks out of the study ) in 13 / 45 patients no recur@@ ring anti@@ bodies ( RI@@ P ) Ass@@ ay re@@ trac@@ eable bodies before , including 3 patients , in which it never had to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ward .
patients with lack@@ ing up to low antibody levels had a robust conf@@ usion of G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel@@ s in Har@@ n , while patients with high antibody tit@@ ers to establish a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed mar@@ gin@@ ally up to low neutr@@ alis@@ ing inhib@@ itor on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ one activity in vit@@ ro , which does not affect the clinical effic@@ acy and / or decre@@ asing of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies were not in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted drugs actions , even if the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted drugs t@@ ugs are typically preserved with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies .
exercis@@ ing for the En@@ z@@ ymer@@ ic Ther@@ apy is located in one for the hydro@@ lys@@ is of accum@@ ulated substance and preventing a further accum@@ ulation of enz@@ ym@@ es .
according to intra@@ ven@@ ous Inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is removed from the circulation and of cells into the lys@@ os@@ om@@ es , most likely about man@@ or 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
safety and effic@@ acy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s were random@@ ised in a random@@ ised , double @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at age 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of the patients had been recru@@ ited , was the majority of patients from the middle phenom@@ en@@ otype and only one patient was the heavy phenom@@ en@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to rise 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effic@@ acy were the percentage change of expected FE@@ V and the absolute sal@@ ary in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ ations treated patients on the placebo group to improve the lung function and the de@@ ability which is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study showed a improvement and / or maint@@ aining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s group and 182 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s group as from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly statist@@ ically significantly and the absolute lung volumes increased significantly more propor@@ tional to the body size .
of the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ ic treatment consisted of 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel was found in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inine ) , which remained constant at the beginning of the academic year .
regarding the h@@ eter@@ ogen@@ eous disease @-@ manif@@ estation between the patients who was carried out clin@@ ically significant changes related to nine patients ( 58 % ) , a change in 10 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one year @-@ old open phase 2 study carried out in which mainly the security and pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic of al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ s were examined at 20 patients at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy duty form and 4 with middle @-@ form form ) .
in four patients the dos@@ ing of increased G@@ AG@@ - Mir@@ ror for increased G@@ AG@@ - mir@@ rors in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) demonstrated after the Z @-@ Score for the younger patients with the heavy duty form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the average ver@@ ification form , whereas no progress in cogn@@ itive development were limited or no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a Phase 4 study , investig@@ ations of pharmac@@ odynam@@ ic effects were performed on the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be able to represent the difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , but it is not demonstrated that the long @-@ term clinical effec@@ tiveness of these two dos@@ es can be equ@@ ival@@ ently .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will ass@@ ess any new information which will be available , and if necessary , the summary of the pharmaceutical features will be updated .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with Cis@@ plat@@ in ( one other drugs against cancer ) , if the cancer is not only removed ( through an operation alone ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant only ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non@@ eth@@ eless &quot; lung cancer , which does not affect the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who were not treated before , in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have already received other chem@@ other@@ ap@@ ies , than all therapy previously used .
to reduce side effects , the patient should benefit from the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin B12 ) and inj@@ ections from vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered with cis@@ plat@@ in in addition , or after the gift of Cis@@ plat@@ in additionally an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ et@@ onic &quot; ( drugs against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liqu@@ ids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood be changed or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced or reduced the dose .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ down together with the formation of DNA and RNA and prev@@ ents the cells .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form are lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of medication , and a longer working duration of cancer cells .
for treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ individual lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study on 571 patients with local or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy with effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another pharmac@@ euticals against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicines against cancer ) and both in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ plat@@ in lived on average 12.@@ 1 months , compared to a cis@@ plat@@ in for 9.3 months .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was calculated using an average survival of A@@ lim@@ ta 8,3 months , compared with 7,9 months in Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients who did not investig@@ ate the squ@@ am@@ ous cell treatment in cases of A@@ lim@@ ta pro@@ lifer@@ ative survival compared to the compar@@ ative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. an approval for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each passage bottle must be increased with 4,2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which makes a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken out and is dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml . ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is displayed in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ ally advanced or metastatic colo@@ rec@@ tal cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with cur@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except at how much - gender @-@ ep@@ ith@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body on surface ( K@@ OF ) administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² K@@ OF as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ individual bronze car@@ cin@@ oma after pre @-@ adjusted chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF has been administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
a reduction of skin and sever@@ ity of skin actions must be held on day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as per day after the treatment an corrosion test@@ oster@@ one will be given .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of pel@@ let , must be taken at least 5 dos@@ es of fo@@ lic acid and intake must be continued during the whole therapy , as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B12 ( 1000 mcg ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as per third party cycle .
in patients , the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created before each gift a complete ble@@ eding was created , including a differenti@@ ation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ce .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( ALT or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose must take place under observation of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood flow or the maximum non @-@ attrac@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
according to the recovery , the patients need to be treated in the tables 1 , 2 , and 3 , which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ology tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 ( except ne@@ ur@@ otox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrup@@ ted with the ALI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient should have the value before the treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be ab@@ orted if in patients with 2 dose reduction of tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ology tox@@ icity in grade 3 or 4 ne@@ ur@@ - continue to apply from grade 3 or 4 ne@@ ur@@ otox@@ icity .
clinical trials did not notice that at age 65 years or over , compared to patients in the age of 65 years , an increased secondary risk report consists of age 65 .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data for safety and effic@@ acy .
in clinical trials were necessary for patients with a cancer agent of ≥ 45 ml / min , which have no dose adapt@@ ations required for all patients recommended Dos@@ age adjustment .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with an liver function of &gt; 1.5 times of the upper Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values ( in the absence of liver metast@@ asis ) or &gt; 5.0 fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver l@@ ungs ) does not have been studied in the study .
patients must be monit@@ ored with regard to bone mark@@ ings and punc@@ tu@@ re@@ ments cannot be given to patients , before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ is number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te value has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ic number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ tion , and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ology tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 of ha@@ em@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity as Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , fe@@ br@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was diagnosed when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients have to be treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ etic lac@@ tic measure to reduce waste @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency ( chlor@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , for at least 2 days prior to therapy , the treatment of therapy and min@@ if@@ - tens 2 days after therapy with punc@@ turing ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ments , the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds have to avoid therapy for at least 5 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with punc@@ turing ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , appropriate risk factors for ren@@ dering of ren@@ al events , including Deh@@ ydr@@ at@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
in case of patients with clin@@ ically significant liqu@@ ids and collection in trans@@ cell@@ ular room a drainage of the result before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 severe cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ic events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance was commonly used in combination with another cy@@ t@@ otox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ous living substances ( except y@@ y@@ f@@ ie@@ ber , these vacc@@ ines is contra@@ sted ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible p@@ tion@@ - of the re@@ productive capacity should be noted before the treatment - G@@ inn should be noted , advice regarding the sper@@ t@@ preserv@@ ation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cardi@@ ov@@ ine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high dos@@ es of non@@ eth@@ anol ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ chlorid acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) result in a reduced punc@@ turing result of side effects .
therefore cau@@ tion is instruc@@ ted when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high dos@@ es of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ - ty@@ l@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ eic acid are applied in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens 2 days after therapy with punc@@ turing ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interest potential as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ments must be avo@@ ided at least 5 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with punc@@ turing .
the large INTRA @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ bodies and ant@@ ine@@ astic chemotherapy requires a higher surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International normal@@ ities ) if the decision was hit , the patient - du@@ cks with oral anti@@ glau@@ coma .
there are no data available for use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but how to de@@ pression anti@@ met@@ abol@@ ites are expected in pregnancy in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necess@@ arily challeng@@ ing and after careful absence of use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible effect of re@@ productive capacity , men should be rejected before the treatment course , advice regarding the sper@@ ma@@ preserv@@ ation process .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ ly bo@@ xed in breast milk and un@@ wanted effects of inf@@ alli@@ zed inf@@ ant can &apos;t be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity properties that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om and random@@ ized Cis@@ plat@@ in and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as well as 163 patients with mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , and random@@ ized Cis@@ plat@@ in as Mon@@ otherapy .

the prob@@ ability of occurr@@ ence of gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can be absor@@ bed if all@@ i is taken together with a fat single dose or ob@@ ese nutrition .
because the weight reduction in diabetes with an improved met@@ abolic control should take place , before the treatment with all@@ i have to cons@@ ult a physician or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti @-@ di@@ abet@@ ics should be custom@@ ized .
patients , all@@ i as well as medic@@ inal against hyper@@ tension or have increased chol@@ esterol levels , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist , whether the dosage should be adjusted in this medicine .

the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been rated as follows : as a change of body weight ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those students who have lost more than 5 % and more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies , the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average changes in total chol@@ esterol was 60 mg @-@ 2.4 % ( output value 5,20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins amounted to 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3,30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is applied for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like Cis@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chemotherapy for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effic@@ acy of Alo@@ xi can be used through an additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as Anti@@ em@@ et@@ onic ) .
treatment in patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the substance represents an chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the loan of Dar@@ m .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adult , chem@@ other@@ ap@@ ies received , which are strong or moderate dis@@ sol@@ u@@ ble for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
chem@@ other@@ ap@@ ies , the severe trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 of 223 ) , compared with 57 % of the patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
for chem@@ other@@ ap@@ ies , the regular expression of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi treated with Alo@@ xi , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dag@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a approval for traffic of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of ac@@ ute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer prevention and prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effec@@ tiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting which is induc@@ ed by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colo@@ rec@@ tal passage should be monit@@ ored with an@@ am@@ nest@@ y or@@ ch@@ ip@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ ac@@ ute I@@ le@@ us according to injection of injection .
as with other 5@@ H@@ T3 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , is instruc@@ ted with the same gift of Pale@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines referred the Q@@ T interval extended or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or die for such an extension .
except in connection with another chem@@ other@@ ap@@ eu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy or to be used for treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhib@@ ited against tumor activity of the five investigated chem@@ other@@ ap@@ eu@@ tics ( cis@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous dose pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ ues concentration of the Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D6 @-@ inhib@@ itors .

experience to the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ anci@@ es are not used , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is not applied for pregnant women , unless it is required of treated doctor as required .
in clinical trials , the most common ad@@ verse events were observed at a dose of 250 mcg ( total of 633 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , he@@ ada@@ ches ( 9 % ) and or@@ ch@@ ip@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of in@@ sensitive reactions and reactions in the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , compl@@ aints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reviews .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar incid@@ ents showed un@@ wanted events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose related relation@@ ships .
no di@@ alys@@ is studies were carried out , due to the large volume volumes , it is probably not effective treatment in a Alo@@ xi@@ ety over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double bl@@ ind@@ ings , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ drug chemotherapy with a ≤ 50@@ mg / m2 dose phosph@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mcg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of un@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time period 7.3 hours ) , which was given a day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason intra@@ ven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 667 patients who received a heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and ox@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pale@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were treated with patients who were treated in Day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy was sum@@ mar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy induc@@ ed nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( CIN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron based on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters of the Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls were comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of the clinical investig@@ ations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron poss@@ esses the ability to block at vent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ars De@@ - and Rep@@ ri@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation involved in the shareholders and the duration of the shareholder .
the study of 221 healthy volunteers conducted in 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. ab@@ hor@@ ri@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single dos@@ es of 0.25 , 0,75 and 2.25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption According to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows an initial withdraw@@ al of Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ations a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average termin@@ ated half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area of concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tionally propor@@ tional for dos@@ ing in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg .
according to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 dos@@ es , the ser@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron Plas@@ ma@@ concentration was measured at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic sim@@ ulations , that at once a daily intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron achieved a total ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the following intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was measured at 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % will be elim@@ inated above the kid@@ neys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron by less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ H@@ T3 recept@@ or .

in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are lying than sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 from pre@@ clinical trials took part that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can be block@@ ed in very high concentrations of I@@ onic forms that are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ri@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ar@@ z@@ nei@@ ge ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the re@@ alization of approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C pres@@ cri@@ bed medication is recommended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C with al@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same ar@@ z@@ ne@@ il@@ ich , it should be approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference ar@@ z@@ nei@@ ge &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ resistant ) hep@@ atitis C ( one of a vir@@ al infection of liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ scope of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic tests the liver tissue damage , the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ s al@@ an@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( ALT ) in the blood is increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) is applied to the formation of the effects .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on put data on data from the Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingre@@ dient , composition , and pur@@ ity of medication , effects , safety and effic@@ acy of hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study of hep@@ atitis C , the effic@@ acy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the effec@@ tiveness of the reference ar@@ z@@ ent to 455 patients .
in the study was measured , as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment on the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus at blood ) .

in addition , concerns have been extern@@ ally extern@@ ally , the data to the stability of the active ingre@@ dient and the promin@@ ent medication should not be sufficient .
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C based on the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to clinical study .
after setting of the treatment with al@@ he@@ on flame ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease accounted for more than one of the reference standard ; in addition , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from this study , the test was to investig@@ ate the study , in how far the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. the bodies forms antibody - special protein - against the drugs ) , not valid@@ ated .

it works by block@@ age of bacter@@ ial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of bacter@@ ial cells , which are produced in proteins ) and inhib@@ its growth of bacteria .
the principal Indi@@ c@@ ator of the effic@@ acy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients , their infection according to the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients at Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were treated with placebo .
in the treatment of inf@@ ested , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ alex@@ in similar contacts : if the results were taken together with Hau@@ tw@@ ain , approximately 90 % of the patients contributed to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go is found in the treatment of ab@@ sz@@ essen ( eit@@ fully @-@ filled hem@@ stit@@ ch in body tissue ) or inf@@ ections , which have been proven or possibly through M@@ RS@@ A were not effective enough .
the most common side effects with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation of the order .
the Committee for Human@@ ar@@ z@@ nei@@ ge ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go has survived against the risks involved in the following super@@ ficial skin inf@@ ections : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • infected small Laz@@ ar@@ ations , shut@@ down and w@@ ounds w@@ ounds .
May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go into the entire European Union .
patients where patients no improvements occurred within two to three days , are supposed to be considered and an alternative therapy is considered to be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ ical or severe local iri@@ rit@@ ation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be , the treatment is broken down and a reasonable alternative therapy of the infection will be started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not supported for tre@@ ating inf@@ ections in which M@@ RS@@ A is known as a re@@ ject ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary studies , the effec@@ tiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ina in patients with inf@@ ections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RS@@ A ) were in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or det@@ eri@@ oration of inf@@ ested point is considered .
the effect of the current usage of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ illo and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to its low plasma concentrations that have been achieved after top@@ ical application of small skin , or inf@@ eri@@ or@@ ating w@@ ounds in vi@@ vo is not expected to expect in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the same tumor gift of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ic@@ onic acid ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max. top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ bul@@ ae in we@@ aving skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure of top@@ ical use of patients , dos@@ es must not be required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ic@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors .

in clinical trials at 2,@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin inf@@ ections , Al@@ tar@@ go applied , was the most common ad@@ verse reactions of errors that concerned about 1 % of patients .
the approach Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance called by ferm@@ entation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( former Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ a@@ anus ) .
the effects of the bacter@@ ic@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhib@@ ition of bacter@@ ial protein isol@@ ate due to a certain binder of the bacter@@ ial ri@@ bos@@ om , which diff@@ ers from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ating anti@@ bacter@@ ial fabri@@ cs .
data indicates that the eng@@ ul@@ ative protein L3 is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L3 and is located in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred to the region .
through the eng@@ agement of inhib@@ iting P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block@@ ed some P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
due to the reason of local currency of the resistance of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some inf@@ ections form , a consultation should be applied through experts .
there were no differences in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , opposite S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EUS , regardless of whether the insulation is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EUS , the presence of stim@@ ulus with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ cid@@ in ) should be considered .

Ambi@@ rix is to protect against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver of the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as one of two dos@@ es of existing vacc@@ inations , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may possibly be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is only used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is ensu@@ red that it can be led out of the existing vacc@@ ination plan .
if a collection dose against hep@@ atitis A or B is available , Ambi@@ rix or other hep@@ atitis A@@ - or -@@ B vacc@@ ine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by creating the immune system ( the natural down@@ ward of the body ) , &quot; how it can def@@ end itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and the surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and its anti@@ bodies .
Ambi@@ rix included the same components such as the Twin@@ rix Adult vacc@@ ine since 1996 and has been approved a vacc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix Kids since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used for protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given as one of three dos@@ es existing vacc@@ ines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Adult ingredients contain some of the data that uses the use of Twin@@ rix adults , also as cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main inde@@ k@@ ator for the effic@@ acy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of anti @-@ protective antibody .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effec@@ tiveness of the vacc@@ ine was compared to six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection of anti @-@ protective antibody against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the protection from Ambi@@ rix in a six @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine dos@@ es ) are head@@ scarf , appet@@ ite , pain at injection point , val@@ idity , matter ( fatigue ) and fri@@ z@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not re@@ act in patients who may have to re@@ act more sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) to the active ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals , including a approval for the traffic of Ambi@@ rix in the entire territory
the base range for the prim@@ ers with Ambi@@ rix which consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is on the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is administ@@ ered .
if a collection vacc@@ inated by hep@@ atitis A , as well as Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding month , vacc@@ inated by using a combination sim@@ ulator .
according to the combination of prim@@ ers , anti @-@ Hepatitis B - Surface anti@@ gen ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ Ag ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ gen values are in the same size , as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ als vacc@@ ines .
it is not completely secured if private compet@@ ent persons that are addressed to an hep@@ atitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , which may also need a collection of vacc@@ ination , because they are not protected by the immune memory by the immune memory .
3 As with all injection pipes , for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction , according to the gift of vacc@@ ine appropriate ways of medical treatment and monitoring must be immediately available immediately .
if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the modular scheme is recommended with the combination sim@@ ulating , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µg of combined hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gen .
for the immune system and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , the anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody must be reached , so that the gift of another vacc@@ ines can be required in these cases .
since a trad@@ ed injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ aired success , these injection paths should be avo@@ ided .
when Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ia or blood dis@@ orders , Ambi@@ rix , however , can be inj@@ ected , since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ inary gift .
if Ambi@@ rix was introduced in the form of a separate injection systems simultaneously using a combined di@@ ph@@ ther@@ - , in@@ activated Poli@@ omy@@ el@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influ@@ enza type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined meas@@ ur@@ - m@@ um@@ ina vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients suffering from immun@@ supp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ def@@ ects must be received , that may not have sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study , which was kid@@ n@@ apped with 3 vacc@@ ines of such form@@ ulation in adults , prev@@ alen@@ ce , Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , he@@ ada@@ ches , and fever comparable with the incidence that was observed at former Thi@@ omer@@ ates and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ine form@@ ulation was observed .
in clinical trials , 2029 vacc@@ ine sockets were administ@@ ered to 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ cans combinations .
only excep@@ tions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ters at a check @-@ based basis , Ambi@@ rix , but not on a check @-@ based base unit .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50.@@ 7 % of subjects , compared with 39.@@ 1 % at subjects according to the gift of a 3 @-@ cans combinations .
after the complete vacc@@ ine cycle reported 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects who had given the Ambi@@ rix which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination of clay , which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combinations .
the prev@@ alen@@ ce of mat@@ ters was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ ine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ rix was compared with 36,@@ 2 % for subjects who received 3 cans of combination @-@ sim@@ ulations ) .
the prev@@ alen@@ ce of pre@@ y pain and mat@@ ters was low and comparable to the administration of the combination @-@ sim@@ pler with the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ine scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study with 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the appearance of loc@@ al@@ re@@ actions and general inter@@ actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable with the 3 @-@ cans combinations of hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µg of combined hep@@ atitis B virus .
in the 6- to 11@@ - year olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequency response of pain ( on injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ xy .
the share of vacc@@ ines , which over severe ad@@ verse events during the 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ine with a combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - Units formed with a combination of hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µg of combined hep@@ atitis C virus , was statist@@ ically significant .
in clinical studies that were conducted at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the ser@@ oc@@ ation rates were carried out for the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for the month 6 .
the ser@@ oc@@ ation rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for the month 6 was administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study that was conducted at 12- and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two dos@@ es had been created by Ambi@@ rix and 147 for the standard combinations of three dos@@ es .
in the 289 people , whose imm@@ unity was able to evalu@@ ate the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational rates ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose significant higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ ob@@ tains in clinical comparison study were 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies there were vacc@@ inated either a 2 @-@ canned vacc@@ ine scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units , form@@ al@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis A virus and 10@@ µg of combined hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gen .
for people who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ bodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months acc@@ ine .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg of combined hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12- and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds showed that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ bodies 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months acc@@ ine is comparable to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ine scheme .

hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transferred by vir@@ al food and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as swimming in the waters of waste water .
you can feel very ti@@ red , have a dark ur@@ ine , a b@@ art@@ y face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow seek ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix could not protect against an infection with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus , even when the complete vacc@@ ine series was completed with 2 dos@@ es .
if you have been infected with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus have already been infected with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus ( though you don &apos;t feel un@@ likely or ill or ill ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other inf@@ ections , who may cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those of hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B infection , can &apos;t be medi@@ ated .
• If a allerg@@ ic reaction is already an allerg@@ ic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allerg@@ ic reaction can be found by ju@@ ck@@ led skin attacks , re@@ spir@@ atory or inc@@ ur@@ ising of vision or tongue . • if you have a allerg@@ ic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • when you have a severe infection with fever / hat .
if you want to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and usually the second vacc@@ ine dose ) .
in a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ine , the doctor will give you your child from a vacc@@ ination using Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis A / hep@@ atitis B vacc@@ ine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ine of this vacc@@ ine was administ@@ ered to an effective sal@@ ary of effective levels , usually a month after the first dose is given to give you a vacc@@ ine protection against the vacc@@ ination of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix in people who is inj@@ ected to severe blood dis@@ orders , under the skin and not into the muscle . if you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or of treatment in your body &apos;s own inten@@ tion or if you are under@@ gone / your child is under@@ gone .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people can not be sufficient to see if a blood test can be needed to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 If you take your doctor / child your child ( including those who have been able to receive your child ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated without dis@@ cri@@ min@@ als , or if you have been able to have been given / or immune bul@@ bul@@ ins ( anti@@ bodies ) / or that is planned in the near future .
but it may be that the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient , and the person is not being protected against any or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
if another vacc@@ ine has to be given at Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and possibly different li@@ mb@@ s .
if Ambi@@ rix is at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ ae , it is likely to be sufficient to be sufficient for the vacc@@ ine .
normally , Ambi@@ rix Schw@@ ang@@ ers or canc@@ el women is not given , except it is strongly necessary that they are vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B .
important information about certain other components from Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor when you have shown an allerg@@ ic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ines , talk with your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

in patients suffering from Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is necessary in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ APS tablets may not be administ@@ ered with stro@@ kes , as a risk for the emer@@ gence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets are not instant immediately in the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MON@@ APS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl rate which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MON@@ APS should therefore be used with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and in@@ hum@@ ing clinical trials are only used to be applied .
as Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate about the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ APS should be used with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ sted ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate to young rats ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ur@@ onal valves and increased loss of ne@@ ur@@ ons .
it also found a del@@ ayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ ebr@@ al Syn@@ ap@@ sen and a reduced number of functional nerv@@ ous in the brain and thus a dis@@ ability of the brain growth .
it could not be noted if Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate is elim@@ inated in breast milk , and this reason is the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ APS represented at 56 % of the patients at least one un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of the un@@ wanted events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ APS in conjunction with AM@@ MON@@ APS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a more prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic female patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , serious hyp@@ ot@@ hes@@ ia , ar@@ mp@@ y@@ to@@ pen@@ ia , periph@@ eral re@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atic .
a case of a over@@ dose occurred in a 5 months old small child with a regular intake of 10 g ( 1370 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate , which showed an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of dos@@ es up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ ing ne@@ ur@@ otox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate is a met@@ abol@@ ically active compound that con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , con@@ jug@@ ate on the kid@@ neys by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric is seen Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with a ure@@ a ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can therefore be regarded as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ ine cycle can be assumed that every gram of inv@@ asive sodium phen@@ yl rate between 0,12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen can be produced .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early as early and the treatment is immediately going to improve survival and clinical results .
the forecast of the ear@@ liest development of the disease with occurr@@ ing of the first symptoms in new@@ b@@ orns grew almost always inf@@ ist , and the disease continued to make treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ alys@@ is and essential amino acids or with their stick@@ y Analog@@ eine within the first year of life .
through hem@@ odi@@ alys@@ is , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , it was possible to increase survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) diagnosed cases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of the pregnancy and the survival rate was 100 % , but even during these patients there was a time with many to spiritual dis@@ abilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with late @-@ manif@@ est form of the disease ( including female patients with the h@@ eter@@ o@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e @-@ Mang@@ el ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ em@@ ic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy and a protein @-@ reduced diet was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ic defic@@ its are also hardly reversible and in some patients may occur a further det@@ eri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state .
it is known that Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate is ox@@ i@@ dis@@ ed to Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with the phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g of So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions according to individual and rep@@ et@@ ric dos@@ es of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ abol@@ ites was also analys@@ ed by intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablets , 15 minutes after taking measuring plasma concentrations were detected by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ cy@@ tes , or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opat@@ hi@@ es was after different dos@@ es of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) there is no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single dos@@ es ) , the mean Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma concentration on the third day , five times higher than the first gifts .
differenti@@ ation of the medicine will be approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine on the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cleus tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MON@@ APS Gran@@ ules is taken from either oral ( inf@@ ants and children who can &apos;t contain any tablets or patients with sl@@ aves ) or given an gast@@ ro@@ ast or n@@ oses .
after the previous clinical experience the normal dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ b@@ orns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of 20 kg , as well as for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine should be kept within the normal area .
in patients suffering from Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is necessary in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ APS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat f@@ utes were exposed to the birth of Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of the brain .
a more prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic female patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , serious hyp@@ ot@@ hes@@ ia , ar@@ mp@@ y@@ to@@ pen@@ ia , periph@@ eral re@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atic .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric is seen Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with a ure@@ a ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can therefore be regarded as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion from over@@ looks .
on the basis of investig@@ ations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of ur@@ ine cycle can be assumed that between 0,12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen can be produced .
already existing neurolog@@ ic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients may occur a further det@@ eri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state .
after an oral single dose of 5 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking an plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
during the period of durability , the patient can pres@@ erve the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C .
during this case , the small measuring sco@@ op is 0,95 g , the medium measuring sco@@ op 2.9 g and the big measuring sco@@ op 8.6 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient must be obtained on a probe , AM@@ MON@@ APS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare cases , certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es are missing , so they are using a nit@@ rogen@@ ous waste products that are based on consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you need to share the doctor that you may have AM@@ MON@@ APS , as So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate influence the results of specific laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MON@@ APS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist when you have taken other drugs or recently , even if it is not pres@@ cription drug .
during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time , you may not take AM@@ MON@@ APS because the medicine could go into breast milk and can &apos;t leave your baby .
in rare cases also conf@@ usion , he@@ ada@@ ches , taste problems , dis@@ inf@@ lic@@ ences , des@@ ori@@ ent@@ ity , mem@@ or@@ ations , and a det@@ eri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical states were observed .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; ac@@ ute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS ) , for example with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest basket ) without &quot; ST@@ - Hebre@@ ws &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to decrease ble@@ eding in patients who under@@ go one PCI will be given a higher dose , and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this may contri@@ bute to patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to det@@ ecting the blood flow to the heart and the effec@@ tiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the study on the treatment of ACS , with the effect of angi@@ ox in all @-@ some gift or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor ( G@@ PI , a different medic@@ inal ) with the conventional combination treatment with hep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and an G@@ PI was compared .
while the PCI was often found a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a lock ) , and additionally received other medic@@ inal det@@ ention of blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attack or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ ization ) after 30 days or a year , as well as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ went one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was the same effective as the hep@@ arin , except for severe blood dis@@ orders , with which it was significantly more effective than hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be used by patients who may possibly be in@@ sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against b@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other sh@@ ep@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it must not be applied in patients who had a blood dis@@ pers@@ ist , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or dis@@ infection .
the Committee for Human@@ ar@@ z@@ nei@@ ge ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is at the treatment of ACS and a PCI an ann@@ ot@@ able subst@@ itute for hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a approval for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) patients with an emergency stop or if an early intervention is fore@@ seen .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ al of 0.1 mg / kg followed by a inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if the patients had been carried out in another consecutive epis@@ ode , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , and the inf@@ usion for the duration of impact on 1.75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
following the PCI requirements for clinical creation , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be absor@@ bed for 4 to 12 hours .
directly before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg shall be given , followed by a inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous det@@ achment of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose followed by intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the input .
the safety and effec@@ tiveness of a very few Bol@@ us treatment by An@@ gi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI input is planned .
this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) short@@ ened to less than 225 seconds , should take place a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the delivery of a lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully administ@@ ered , and the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly administ@@ ered intra@@ ven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is not necessary , provided the 1.75 mg / kg Inf@@ us@@ ion@@ sd@@ osis is used correctly .
in patients with medium @-@ severe non @-@ functional restri@@ ction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is treated with a PCI ( whether with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS grade or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is repeated once again and exam@@ ine the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt of the second bolt .
in patients with moderate kidney , which led in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Bol@@ us without a dose of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 If patients with severe kidney disease ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ alys@@ is paid patients is An@@ gi@@ ox Con@@ tra@@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox is a 30 minutes after the termination of intra@@ ven@@ ous gift from un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low @-@ molecular hep@@ arin .
• unknown hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingre@@ dient or other components or against mil@@ de@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or enh@@ ance blood dis@@ orders . • severe un@@ controll@@ able hyper@@ tension and sub@@ ac@@ ute bacter@@ ial end@@ oc@@ ard@@ itis . • severe kidney disease ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ alys@@ is paid patients
patients are carefully to monitor the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood , especially when B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI @-@ patients under@@ occur under B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding occur in patients that occur in a per@@ col@@ ourful cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment prin@@ cip@@ ally occur everywhere .
in patients who were treated war@@ far@@ in and be treated with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should ensure a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ value ( International normal@@ ities ) to ensure that the value of the treatment with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in will be reached before the treatment existing level .
based on the knowledge about the effects of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tik@@ a or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ce aggreg@@ ate sh@@ em@@ mer ) may be assumed that these active ingredients can increase the blood of blood .
in combination of B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with plat@@ elets or anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters in each case .
the experimental studies are refer@@ ring to imp@@ acts on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ integration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the hep@@ arin compared groups came to women as well as in patients over 65 years more likely to un@@ wanted events than with male or younger patients .
serious ble@@ eding were defined according to AC@@ UI@@ TY and Tim@@ i standards for severe blood vessels as defined in Table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ eding were significantly less frequently in the groups of hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor and B@@ ival@@ id@@ ru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ UI@@ TY severe ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ al , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular blood levels of ≥ 5 g / dl , without ob@@ vious blood dis@@ infection , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries of ≥ 3 g / dl , with unknown hem@@ or@@ rh@@ osis , treatment of blood production to trans@@ f@@ usion .
further , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ alis@@ ations that occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , &quot; other &quot; point setting , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , ear , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who under@@ went a PCI .
both in the B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the hep@@ arin compared groups were women as well as in patients over 65 years more likely to un@@ wanted events than with male or younger patients .
both light and severe ble@@ eding compet@@ ed significantly less than in the compar@@ ative group under hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor .
the following ad@@ verse events which are not listed above , have been reported as a comprehensive application in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organs in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is immediately off immediately and to monitor the patient with regard to a ble@@ eding .

Ap@@ i@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adol@@ esc@@ ents and children from 6 years with diabetes , which require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ i@@ dra is sub@@ j@@ ute ( under the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm inj@@ ected using an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease , where the body is not sufficient in@@ sul@@ in to regul@@ ate glucose levels ( sugar ) or the ins@@ ulin is not effective in effect .
ins@@ ulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers distinct from Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter effects , as a short @-@ efficient human medicine has been widely circul@@ ated .
Ap@@ i@@ dra was studied in combination with a durable ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce an ins@@ ulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , ins@@ ulin at which the body ins@@ ulin had no effect , Ap@@ i@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indication for the effic@@ acy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ ating hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good of the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0,14 % ( from 7.@@ 46 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0,14 % in ins@@ ulin delivery .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lo@@ wering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ i@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in human normal ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ i@@ dra may not be used in patients who are not exceeding sensitive ( allerg@@ ic ) against ins@@ ulin , or one of the other components , or in patients who have already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
dos@@ es of Ap@@ i@@ dra must be adjusted to be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines referred to the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted a approval for the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ venti@@ s Deutschland GmbH .
Ap@@ i@@ dra is available as a sub@@ k@@ ut@@ ane injection either in the area of ab@@ dom@@ inal tract or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections or sub@@ cut@@ aneous using continuous inf@@ usion into the area of ab@@ dom@@ inal tract .
due to the reduced Glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the di@@ sul@@ p@@ sulph@@ ur locking may cause ins@@ ulin @-@ demand in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the effects , the mark ( her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin ty@@ ps ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized delay , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the production method can be changed after the ins@@ ulin relief .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or break@@ through of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ abet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ osis ; these circumstances are potenti@@ ally life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the conversion of a patient on another ins@@ ulin type or an ins@@ ulin is to take place under str@@ enger medical supervision and can be required a change of dosage .
at the time of a matter of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effects of the ins@@ ulin used , therefore can change the treatment of treatment .
to the substances that enh@@ ancing ble@@ eding activity and increase the incl@@ ine of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , anti@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ates , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ in , mono@@ amine @-@ oxid@@ ation , sal@@ icy@@ lic acid , sal@@ icy@@ lic anti@@ biot@@ ics , sal@@ icy@@ lic anti@@ biot@@ ics .
in addition , among the effect of symp@@ ath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lu@@ res , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Res@@ er@@ pin , the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen have been shot down or are missing .
animal experimental studies in the re@@ productive di@@ cial studies show no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occur in human breast milk , but generally , ins@@ ulin is neither into breast milk , nor is absor@@ bed after oral application .

studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at the sub@@ k@@ ut@@ ans Ga@@ - be performed faster by ins@@ ulin &apos;s ins@@ ulin , and the active time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - a ins@@ ulin @-@ relevant dos@@ ing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , a dose propor@@ tional glu@@ cos@@ mic effects , and with 0.3 E / kg or more a dis@@ propor@@ tional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ystem impact , exactly like human@@ ise ulin .
ins@@ ulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double so fast active effect as normal human medicine and achie@@ ves the complete glu@@ cos@@ ystem effects about 2 hours earlier than human@@ ist .
data from the data was conf@@ id@@ ent that at an application of ins@@ ulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meals a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved by human normal ins@@ ulin , which will be given 30 minutes before the meal .
