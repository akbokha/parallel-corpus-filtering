<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Actation Report (EPAR), which is explained, as the Committee for Humanarticulation Report (CHMP) has been judged to get through recommendations regarding the application of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information on your disease or their treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish more information regarding the recommendations of the CHMP recommendations, please read scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets (tablets, which solve themselves in the mouth), as a solution to intake (500mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening, or toes of dingen, which are not present), mission I disorder, a psychic illness, during which the patients manical episodes (Period of abnormal accumulation) alternating with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat medium to severe severe episodes of the treatment and prevention of manical episodes for patients who have been addressed to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used to fast control of gesteigerated unrest or behavioral interference, if the oral medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used to take the melting or melting tablets in patients where the slothills of tablets may be processed.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medications at the same time, the recommended dose should be adjusted by flilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impaired the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol works probably mainly as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in smaller sizes than the neurotransmitter has to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine with shizophrenia and bipolar interruption to normalize the activity of the brain and normalize the activity of the brain, resulting psychotic or manical symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was investigated in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that had increased to placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to twelve weeks in 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo experienced in to 160 patients with which the manical symptoms had already been stabilized.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was found in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from Lorazepam (another antipsychotonic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms of patients from a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the company also led studies to examine how the body produces the melting of melt and the solution to absorbate (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution showed a significant stronger reduction in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significant stronger reduction of symptoms had increased amlessness than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the treatment of bipolar interference, Abilify decreased more than placebo in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented up to 74 weeks, more effective than placebo in previous episodes of previously treated patients and when it was administered to an existing therapy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Disgeneric injections in 10 or 15 mg doses decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms gested unrest and were similar to effect as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events from Abilify to entrance (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients), adache (permanent motion), preservation (elevating production), preservation (elevating production), fatigue and fatigue (elevating production), fatigue and fatigue (elevations), fatigue and fatigue (trouble), insomnions (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanitating agents (CHMP) resulted in the conclusion that the advantages of gravity at treatment of schizophrenia and severe episodes of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes about the treatment with Aripiprazol, and opposite risk of risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in quick control of increased amlessness or in patients with manical episodes about Bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable for risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for placing Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of regular to severe episodes of the Bipolar I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, representing the greater episodes and their manical episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals than Monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the Treatment of Schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to larger sensitivity of this patient, a lower initial dose should be considered, if clinical factors are justify (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is set out of combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide behavior belongs to mental disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased sufficiency risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol is to be used with caution of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic disorders), cerebrovic diseases, conditions used for hypotonia predisponing (dehydrate medicines) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there was an important reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">When using ABILIFY, patients treated patients and symptoms of a late dyspy should be taken into consideration, the dose to reduce or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or inclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns have to be set to all non-psychotics, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazol was to be used in patients with crevangeles in the Anamnese or in circumstances which are used to be used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, had treated patients with Aripiprazol, an elevated risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relation between the dosage and the response to unwanted tascularascular events with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoazidose or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic effects of patients who allow direct distribution.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polyurie, Polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus, or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of contamination of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight of weight will be observed in general in schizophrine patients and patients with bipolarization, the use of anti-psychotics, with which weight increased as a side effects, and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol to the central nervous system is instructed when Aripiprazol in combination with alcohol or other centralised medication may be taken with overflow (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, an gastric acid blockers, reduces the Resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is irrelevant than clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6-inhibitor (Chinese) increased the AUC by Aripiprazol to 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect another highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetin and paroxetin, similar effects and therefore should be performed similar dose.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism can result the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">When you examine the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits must undertake the potential risks for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, you can do similar effects and therefore should be performed similar dose.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose should be increased from ABILIFY on the dose of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6, together with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with a regular increase of Aripiprazor concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphan ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">In the patient should become notified, their doctor should become noticeable if they pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data of security in humans and due to the reproductive studies at the animal, this medication should not be applied in the pregnancy, unless the potential is justified the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotica should also be warned to use hazardous machines, including power vehicles, to operate, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more likely than placebo (≥ 1 / 100) were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events (*).</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the downside effects are defined after the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks, treated with Aripiprazol, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinson's and dyskinesie compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% were treated with aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups of Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Salaries of the CPK (creatine-Phosphokinase), in general, temporarily and asymptuning, were observed in 3.5% of the patients with Aripiprazol treated patients compared to 2.0% of treated patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic syndrome, the malignant neuroleptical syndrome, Spätdyskinesie, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or abaky overdose with Aripiprazol alone was observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without any death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol. however, it is unlikely that herointse in the treatment of a overdose of benefits, as Aripiprazol has a high plasmapa.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol to Schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disorder concerning the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1receptors and an antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, to Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 adrenergen and the Histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Gift from Aripiprazol in doses of 0.5 upto 30 mg. once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dosing dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligences, on Nucleus caudatus and am Putting.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrine patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a semi-controlled trial in week 52 of the proportion of Responsies in the study, one response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which have been defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression ratio, showed significant stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic Schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the declining rate, which was measured at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study at Schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of evaluation processes) in significantly fewer patients had a weight of at least 7% compared with the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) in average weight of approx.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with a flexible dose of over 3 weeks with a manor or mixed Episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a placebo over placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study about 3 weeks with a fixed dosing of patients with a manor or mixed Episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed to placebo no overleous effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active controlled Monotherapy studies of 12 weeks in patients with a manor or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a comparable efficiency compared to placebo in week 3 and an increase, comparable to lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also proved an comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie to like lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks of patients with a manor or mixed Episode 1, with or without psychotic characteristics, the escort therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in the reduction of manic symptoms in comparison to Monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 weeks after a placebo-controlled trial over 74 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks, the Aripiprazol showed to placebo over placebo over the prevention of a bipolar combination, mainly due to the prevention of a feedback.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro studies are the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 for elongation and Hydroxyrazol, the N-Dealkylation is addressed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination of Elimination life is nearly 75 hours for Aripiprazol with an extensive metabolism of CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinic investigation did not be sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation for pharmacokinetics showed no indication on clinically significant differences in pharmacokinscriptures or the impact of smoke on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinic features of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol was similar to patients with serious cardiac insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on pharmacokinol of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to pull snapshots on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies for safety-harming, toxicity in reversed gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and law potential of the preclinical data are no special danger for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or positions, which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of people, so they have only limited or no significance.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects converted a dosing-dependent secondary counterfeit detects (Lipofuscin-pigment) and an increase in secondary rats at 60 mg / kg / day (equal rats at 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10fold in the recommended steady state exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a factor of sulphate conjugate of Aripiprazol in the Galle ranging from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day should be found at the recommended clinical use of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the human Galle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of concentrated concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripiprazol is no more than 6% of concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of vitro solubility.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Accuracy Report (EPAR), which is explained, as the Committee for Humanarticulation Report (CHMP) has implemented the conducted studies in order to access recommendations regarding medication.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied for treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can not be displayed in patients (especially overweight patients) in which Metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not shown together with another diabetesdrug (DualTherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients), which can not be used with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose, not satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphylharnmaterial or insulin, the previous dose of sulfur treatment can be retained, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulpylharsh or the insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body insulin is better impacted and the blood glucose levels can be adjusted, thereby reducing the type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Triplea therapy was investigated; in addition the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulpylharnant, additionally it received for up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in blood (glycerosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates that the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in a decrease of HbA1c value that it might be close to the blood glucose levels of dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Triplethic study demonstrated the effect of the additional gift of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphfonylharnant in a decrease of HbA1c values in a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin studied in 289 patients, the patients who received Actos in addition to insulin, a decrease of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to placebo in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were visionaries, infections of the upper respiratory symptoms (reduction), weight loss and hypoaesthesia (diminished sensitivity to irritate).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be applied to patients, may not react or insensitive (allergic) opposite Pioglitazon or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic Ketoazidosis (high heretic levels - acidol mirror - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the framework of a monotherapy (in the sole use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin for patients, is not shown in which Metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited, approved for the transport of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white and white, round, curved and carry on one side the markings "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar with insulin inadequate or untolerability is not appropriate (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years no data available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronare heart disease), the doctor should begin to begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardiac ingestive heart failure, weight increasing or oil can be observed, particularly those with a reduced cardialer reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">The patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardiac failure, weight increasing and oil can be observed when Pioglitazon used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone was performed under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing ordinary loans.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study showed an increase in reports on cardiac insufficiency, but not to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used by Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-Spiegel up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are increased, the liver enzymers are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms developed on a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, digestive, fatigue, appetite and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymers.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon should be continued, should be led to the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dossically dependent weight increase, which can be prevented by fat deposits, and in some cases with a fluid connection is connected.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a prisoner at the therapy with Pioglitazon a lower reduction in the medium hemoglobinar values (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematoplasties (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed with comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazon patients with metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobins at 3-4% and the hematocrits around 3.6-4.1%) and insulin (relative reduction in hemoglobins by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the elevated insulin sensity consists of patients, the Pioglitazon as orale dual or triple combination therapy with sulphuylharnmaterial or as dual - combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dossically hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch with Thiazolitones, including Pioglitazon, including a deterioration or a deterioration of a diabetic macular dems with a reduction of visual acuity was reported.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there are no direct connection between the gestion of Pioglitazon and the appearance of macular droplet if patient should report about disruptions of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic declaration should be considered to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarized analysis of messages from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients, treated with Pioglitazon were treated with pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fractions-incidence amounted to 1.9 fractions per 100 patient's patients treated with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractions for women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROactive study, a study over 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, freight rates of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 Frakstructures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Frakstructures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patient should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient exclude a pregnancy or those who enter the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics by Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenolic couma and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interaction with medicines which are metabolised of these enzymes, e.g. orale contrasts, Cyclosporin, Calcium Lactite and HMGCoA-Reductasformerly are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC by Pioglitazon around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to be due to the treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces the hyperinsulum and increased insulin-resistance of the breast reduction and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the oil growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from present data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in turgors and the fractive index of lens, as they can also be observed with other hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-ascene about three times the upper limit of the standard range equal to placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfonylharnmaterial.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with pre-existing ordinary loans, the incidence of a serious cardiac insufficiency cause 1,6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch was rare over the heart failure at Pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the Anamnese industry.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was a summarized analysis of messages from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medial groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of running PROactive study, freight structures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day after seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have a activation of specific core recipes (Peroxisome proliferator) with receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which leads to an elevated insulin sensity of liver, fat and skeleton muscles.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces Glucosereproduction in the liver and peripheral injury in case of insulin-resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as Monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment course).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, a blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) by Pioglitazon in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients among gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate, despite three-month optimisation phase that were randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who remained only Insulin; a reduction by the insulin-treated patients treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decrease in Albumin / Kreatinine-Quotians compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was checked in a small, usually tested on type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the plasma-triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase of the HDL- cholesterol levels and slightly lower, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazon decreased to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo was no statistically significant increase in the LDL Cholesterinspiegel, whereas Metformin and Gliclazid decreased values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks reduced pioglitazon not only the Nüchtern-triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, both about an effect on the triglyceride absorption and also on hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, were randomized in total of 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced drenabetic and cardiovascular therapy, either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is rapidly accelerated quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of Pioglitazon plasma become usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV represents the effectiveness into approximately three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interventions studies, pioglitazon could not be detected any relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacokics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenol procouma and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) and the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After the application of radioactive markers Pioglitazon in humans, the markers was found mainly in the subjects (55%) and to a lower extent in the harp (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-Elimination period of unmodified Pioglitazon amounts to 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in healthy volunteers with a limited renal function lower than in healthy volunteers and resembles the pathial clearing of the mother's substitution.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys overcomes after repeated appointments, anaemia and reversibly execcentric heart-hypertrophemia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to be due to the treatment with pioglitazon which reduces the hyperinsulum and increased insulin-resistance of the breast reduction and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the oil growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-time studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of urinary epithelium cells were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family-genomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazliqdindionen led to a increased frequency of colontaneous tumours.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white and white, round, flat and carry on one side the markings "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fractions-incidence amounted to 1.9 fractions per 100 patient's patients treated with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractions for women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROactive study, a study over 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, freight rates of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 Frakstructures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Frakstructures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of combination therapy were investigated metformin each with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in Albumin / Kreatinine-Quotians compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks reduced pioglitazon not only the Nüchtern-triglyceride levels, but improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, both with an effect on the tryglyceride absorption and also on hepatic tryglyceride absorption.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacking on their primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly coronarisation syndrome, surveyor above the buttons, Coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, place the results close to the ingestion of Pioglitazon is not connected to cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white and white, round, flat and carry on one side the markings "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary of reporting from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials treated over a period of 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients, treated with pioglitazon and showed increased incidence of bone breaks in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROactive study, a study over 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, freight rates of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 Frakstructures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Frakstructures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>

<seg id="865">In the study after 12 weeks, the concentration of a substance (glycerylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which indicates that the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane resulted in a decrease of HbA1c-Spiegels that the blood glucose levels have been significantly lowered as with another human medicine.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients who could possibly be more sensitive (allergic) on Humaninsulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphan may be adjusted, if it is administered along with a number of other medicines referred to the blood sugar (the complete list is to be needed).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Humanarzneige (CHMP) resulted in the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane in the treatment of diabetes versus the risk of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted a approval for the company Novo Nordisk A / S to transport Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Mixed insulin-products are usually used once or twice daily, if a fast initials will be desired together with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">Injection needle must allow for at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose settings are significantly improved by a intensive insulin-therapy, the hypoglycemia has been changed and should be corrected accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any changes regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin, long effective insulin etc.), type of insulin, human insulin, or insulin, or insulin, or insulin, or insulin, or insulin, such a change is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If changing to Actraphan in patients a dose is required, this may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients suffering from hypoglycemic reactions after a change of animal in human insulin reported that the early Warnsymptomes reported a hypoglycemia is less pronounced than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which should go over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to recover the Council of his doctor, as such journeys, insulin and meals must be applied to other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore advise possible interactions in therapy, and to ask for the patients with some of them regulatory medicines.</seg>
<seg id="879">4. the hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia which can occur in a non-controlled diabetics therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Heavy hypoglycemia may lead to awareness and / or crust cases, and cause long-lasting effects of brain function and even the death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system opportunities - peripheral Neuropathy a rapid improvement of blood glucose monitoring can be associated with complaints that are known as acute painful Neuropathy and normally reversibly.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A intensive therapy of insulin-therapy with a corrupt improvement of blood glucose levels, however, it can be connected with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="1434">Tactical view mirror of tacrolimus should also be possible to change by prograf on Advagraf, dose modification, changes of immune medication, which could change the tacrolimus whole blood levels (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, adjustments the dose of several days to enter the Steady State.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley is not exceed the blood level of 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley view of Tacrolimus is usually in the first time after liver transplants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and a heart transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent retention therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe unwanted events, including transplants, or other side effects, which can occur in a row of tacrolimus under- or overexposition.</seg>

<seg id="1450">Simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines referred to as a Hemmer or inductors of CYP3A4 can increase the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus reduce blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to change the Tacrolimuscular level of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism, to monitor the tacrolimus dose for maintaining accurate concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1455">The Tacrolimus effect on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor. therefore, simultaneous use of Tacrolimus can be metabolised by CYP3A4, whose metabolism are affected by metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus replacing the Clearance of steroid contraceal and thus reducing the hormone exposition, is especially cautious for decisions concerning receiving measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus potentially reducing the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenazon and can extend their semi-value.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a lack of factor VIII conte, innate bleeding mind).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of use is due to whether Advate is applied for treatment of bleeding or prevention of surgery in surgeries.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from VIII deficiency, which causes bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but it is known as a "recombination DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell which was brought into a gene (DNA), which allows it to formation the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a different defined benefit from the European Union called Recombinate, is similar, however, this medication has no protein human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of medication was investigated for prevention of blood and surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of Advate for prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleeding, with "excellent" or with "good" rated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Schwinn, headaches, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be applied to patients who may possibly be more sensitive (allergic) against the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse - or Hamsterprotein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted a approval for the company Baxter AG to transport Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: dosing and duration of the substitute therapy according to the severity of the factor VIII-Mangel, after the place and the extent of blood cells and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following coagorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma level (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients with 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat, until the pain and the prey impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat, until the risk of patients passed over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment, the controller is to be administered to control the dose and incidence of injections an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can be distinguished in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo Recovery and different half-times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. by factor VIII per kg of weight.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII can't be reached, or if the bleeding is not ruled by a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out if required a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitor values it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The appointment speed should be addressed according to the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">Formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1552">This inhibitors have always been modified against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG Immunglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda assay (B.E.) per ml plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk within the first 20 exposition days of the largest, and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposition and anamnesty inhibitors, after the implementation of a recombined factor VIII-product on another that were observed (lowest) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women lie with factor VIII during pregnancy and still life.</seg>
<seg id="1556">In the largest number of patients treating ADRs were inhibited against factor VIII (5 patients) that had risen to a higher risk to education of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and Schwinn (3 patients).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000 up to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10.000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the available data is not estimated).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the first release of the data of the CHMP, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk reduction, but has been considered a positive effect, but the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has required on the basis of safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided to apply a further extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular was officially activated by the Committee for Humanarzneige (CHMP) that the company's request for permission granted by Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, bone or the soft parts (tissue, which connects the other structures in the body, relies and supports) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus, which has been transformed that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">At the virus in Advexin this is a "Adenovirus," which was so altered that there is no copies of itself and therefore cannot dissolve in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein that is made out of which is not defective in the human body of the p53-gene, is usually contributes to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein has not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow up and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company made data from a study involving a patient before the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the undermining, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP's responses to the company had been reviewed issues, some questions were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the exam, initially submitted documents the CHMP to Day 120 a list of questions which will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently proved that injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-tumours benefits for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had reconcern regarding the processing of medicines in the body, the type of administration and the safety of medication.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently proved that Advance can be made in a reliable way that it is neither for the environment for people who come in enlow contact with the patient are harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The CHMP is not included in knowledge if the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participated in clinical trials or "compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed active ingredient means that the tablets are thus composed as follows that one of the most effective components immediately and the other slowly over some hours away.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used for treatment of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (Heuschnucking) by an allergy against Pollen inflammation (noses) in patients with rhinestones (linked nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers over 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The treatment time should be as soon as possible and finishes, as soon as the symptoms, especially the vulnerability of the nose and nose.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of medication may be stored on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The efficiency measures, the changes of the severity barriers were reported by Heuschnupfymptors that were reported from the patient before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary, and evaluated the symptoms in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all Heuschnupfymptors except the constipation of the nose reported the patients who received Aerinaze, compared with 35.9% in the patient who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the vulnerability of the nose was considered, the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26,7% in the patients who alone assessed Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), tankycares (cardiac disease), degradation, headaches, fatigue, insomnions (insomnia), somebolence (sleep fries), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerosze may occur in patients who may possibly very sensitive (allergic) against Desloratadin, pseudoephedrin or one of the other ingredients, against adrenal active ingredients or Loratadin (another medicines for the treatment of allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also be used in patients used to prevent hypertension (high blood pressure level), hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyreose (overfunction of thyroid) or already caused a hashan rhage (caused by a brain bleeding) or a risk of limiting rhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe Company approved a approval for the transport of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is grieve in the lances (i.e. without them to break or to break down).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should be used because of the absence of data on the unintention and effectiveness (see section 5.1) not to be used in children under 12 years.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of application is as short as possible, and should not be continued after graduation of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days, as long as long-term use, the activity of pseudoephedrine can be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Following the decline of grinding of grinding in the upper respiratory for the treatment when needed with Desloratadin as Monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrin, it is also contrasted in patients with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are treated or within 2 weeks after termination of a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is based on alphamimetic activity of pseudoephedrine, such as Bromocripitin, Pergolid, Lisorid, Cabergolin, Ergotamine, Dihydroergotamin, Phenylephrine, ephedrin, Oxymetacolin, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked and the data are not sufficient to arrange the recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data are not enough to discuss the recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients must be informed that the treatment with a hypertension or tachycarat or of Ppitations, heart rhythms, nausea or naughtest neurologic symptoms (like headaches or a reinforcement of the headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of patient groups: • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamese, diabetes mellitus, blisters ruction or bronchospasm in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of the matological tests, because Antihistamine is otherwise positive response to indicators for skin reaction or reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In addition, clinical trials with Desloratadin, in which Erythromycin or Ketoconazole have been administered, however, no clinically important interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychotoric tests there were no significant differences between the associated with Desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">It is not identified for the metabolism of Desloratadin responsible, so that interaction with other drugs will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The immunity of use of Aerinas during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase of abnormalities compared to normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies of animals not always be transferred to humans and are not applied to the vasokonstrictor's properties of pseudoephedrin should not be applied in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, the patient should also be clarified that it may occur in very rare cases, which can cause a impairment of traffic light or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a ZNS depression (sedation, apnoe, diminished spiritual attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collagen) and a zNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, preservations) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, exhaustive heart rate, muscle weakness, respiration, nausea, cardiovascular, nausea, nausea, nausea, precordiale pain, jinnitus, breath interference and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A zNS-stimulation is especially probably, as well as Atropin-typical symptoms (oral temptiness, plupils, and dilatation, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human rectile cells / basophile as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adventurement of endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults showed Desloratadin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of the airing performance, including subjective celess or tasks that are connected to the fig.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dose of 5 mg. a day, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The orale application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage may cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a joint excitement.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1.248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonally allergic rhinocitis, with 414 patients of Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histaminantagonist efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined based on the totality of symptom (except rhinoclassification), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets in terms of fluctuous effect, was determined significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze is Desloratadin within 30 minutes after administration at plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers on 14 days the flowing balance of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydeslorate and Pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinan surbal study, which was performed with the formulation of healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects Desloratadin poorated badly.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components of interest study shows that the exposition (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to an exposition after the gift of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies for safety-harming, toxicity in reaffinity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin no particular planing for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally consistent with the pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-dynamic studies was the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal specialised rhinitis and two studies in patients who had also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by using the change of symptoms (Juckreiz, number and size of squares, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) and after sixty treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Other studies were submitted to realize that the body produces the syrup, the solution for insertion and molten tablets in the same manner as the tablets and the application of children is unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In an allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius to an average decrease of symptom values (symptom points) by 25 to 32% compared to the patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtics, the decrease of sympathscores after sixteen treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared with placebo was 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied to patients who may possibly be insensitive (allergic) against Desloratadin, Loratadin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted a approval for the home of Aerius to transport of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without meal, for the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtics (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy at application of Desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurring of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease of disease and can be carried out after the intends of symptoms and will be back again.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persisting allergic rhinitis (occurring of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to the patient during the allergy time.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in the context of clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazol was administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, intraocular effect of Aerius and alcohol is not reinforced (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, the patient should also be clarified that it may occur in very rare cases that can be able to use a impairment of traffic light or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic Urtics, were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events of adverse events were reported on Placebo than in placebo (1.2%), oral disease (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>

<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, an allergic rhinitis in dependence on the duration of symptoms can also be divided in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As based on the situation in the questionnaire at the Rhino business administration, Aerius effectively reduces the seasonal-allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic Urtics has been examined depend for further forms of Urtics, since the underlying Pathophysiology remains similar to the different forms and chronic patients can easily be recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine presence has been a cause factor in all uronautious disease is expected that Desloratadin apart from the chronic idiopathic Urtics is also leading to an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical control lines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic Urtics, Aerius could be effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the form of squares at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with Antihistamine in chronic idiopathic Urtics, the minority of patients who did not react at Antihistamines, were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the lawsuit by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients with Desloratadin patients compared to 19% of treated patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics-study, in which patients had been comparable to patients with the common seasonal-allergic rhinitis, was observed in 4% of patients a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no responsible for a clinical relevant cumulation after once daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days ago.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin was not yet identified, so that interaction with other drugs are not excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg meals a meals (fetched, calorie rich breakfast) are not available on the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The alleged clinical studies with Desloratadin and Loratadin resulted in a comparable degree of exposure of Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, intraocular effect of Aerius tablets and alcohol is not reinforced (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall risk of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials with adults and adolescort in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic Urtics, were reported in the recommended dose of 3% more adverse events with Aerius, when they were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, where up to 45 mg Desloratadin (ninety clinical dose) were administered, no clinically important effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years of age were treated for an antihistamine therapy of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (ages 6 and 11).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic critically and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children, can extract the active data of Desloratadin in adults on the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study with multiply in adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily more than 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically important cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the disaster of 45 mg daily (Neunfold the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, showed no extension of the Qtc intervalls.</seg>

<seg id="1781">In adult and young people with allergic rhinocitis, Aerius tablets were effective at the ruling of symptoms such as Niesen, nossecrate and jurireiz of the nose, jurrification and Roman of the eyes as well as Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As based on the situation of the questionnaire at the Rhino business administration, Aerius tablets are effectively produced by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic Urtics, Aerius could be effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the form of squares at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted phenomenon phenomenon was comparable in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasual (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmaceutical multi-dose study with allergic formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, the restricted metabolism.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect the protection against influenza, which is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza-A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a future pandemic in front of a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of flu influenza can be diluted by man, because people don't have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">According to administration of vaccine, the immune system recognizes the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the influenza "body and forms siRNA against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This allows the immune system to form a fast antibody in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membrane cover of the virus caused by the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that detect the human body as a body, detect) and used as an ingredient of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This resulted in the scope of clinical data basis for evaluating safety of the vaccine, to fulfil the requirements of the EMEA region for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot kill the capsules as a solution for income, but this can't be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be classified, if the doctor has been checked, having taken an antiviral drug of the patient before the patient has to be judged so that the virus will be adjusted to the drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agitase aims to body weight.</seg>

<seg id="1910">Aids is not heal to heal AIDS, however, the damage of the immune system and thus preventing the development of HIV connected infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medication, but without Ritonavir, in two major studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, previously not been treated with protease.</seg>
<seg id="1912">With low dossibly Ritonavir, the medicinal product of medications has been taken up for 206 adults, who previously taken the former protease of protecting.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main Indicator for the efficacy, the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV (viral load) or the change of viral load after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitor, however, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml as under placebo, but atrophy was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Ageneration decreased the viral load, but with the children that had been treated with protrackers, only very few on the treatment were treated.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, previously treated with protease of problems, the viral load is the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment the viral load is just as effective as other protease:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under agitonavir together with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks, taking their existing protease.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (breakdown), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin irritation and fables (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase can not be used by patients who may possibly be insensitive (allergic) against Amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinic amplifiers of Ritonavir, but the committee was determined that the benefit of agitase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who did not have been taken a protectomy.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Asoasis was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances, since the time of approval for scientific reasons is only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited, approved for regional transport of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is in combination with other antiretroviral medication for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years now.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Ageneric capsules of amprenavir can be administered together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should apply taking into consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The Bioveravailability of Amprenavir as a solution for income is less than 14% less than Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerates capsules and solution to intake a milligrams per milligrams of basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If oasase capsules without the amplification of Ritonavir (Boopholstery) must be used to be used higher doses of agitonavir (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protrackers were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data to unintention and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinan data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function interferment is reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with mild or regular liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contrasted (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase can not be given at the same time with medication that have a low therapeutic width and also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, the currant herbs (hypericum perforatum), may not be used due to risk analysis and diminished therapeutic effect of Amprenavir during the intake of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be pointed out that Asurase or any other antiretroviral therapy were not to be a healing of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with aspect gases does not reduce the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Assuase capsules together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medication should be used (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1968">52% if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is a close surveillance, because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study to use of Agenerase in combination with didanosin, however, due to the antazids component of didanosin is recommended that the revenue of Didanosin and Agenerase lies at least one hour (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore the gift of Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with sequentia in combination with amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended because the exposition of the protease would be harvested.</seg>

<seg id="1975">If this drug should be used simultaneously, caution must be instructed because Delavirdin because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma glucose levels could be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medication should be applied together, the caution is instructed; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, because a precise prediction of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult to be difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Simultaneous use of Amprenavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration of 193% and thus at an increase with Rifabutin connected effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin together with Agenerase is necessary to provide a reduction in dose of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with Erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma level of both pharmaceuticals could be increased.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of 700 mg fosampir and 100 mg of Ritonavir once a day led to an increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole a day, compared to 200 mg of Ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs, which are listed below, among them also substrates, inhibitor or induction of CYP3A4, can be applied together with Aovase, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be associated to toxic reactions, associated with these medicines are monitored, if they are used in combination with Aovase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease, it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as Aovase, as it can be reproductive disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anti-vulsias, known as enzymeter factors are known (Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with amprenavir can lead to a lower plasma level of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcidipin, diltiazem, imodipine, Isradipin, Nicodpin, Nifedipin, nisoldipin and Verapamil can increase 10 through Amprenavir, making it increase activity and toxicity of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use of Aovase can increase its plasma concentrations in conjunction with PDE5 inhibitors, adverse events including hypotension, tendencies and Priapism reinforced (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg fluticasondepionat intranasal (4 times daily), fluticasonpropionate plasma was significantly decreased by about 86% (90% condensed interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, it is not recommended using asitonavir together with Ritonavir together with these glacokortikoids, it is because the potential benefits of a treatment the risk of systemic coronectic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-Coa-Reductase inhibitors, such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which depends materials strong from CYP3A4, are distinctive extermination of the plasma level in the equivalent administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The plasma level increases this HMG-Coa inductase inhibitors to Myopathy, including Rhabatyolysis, the combined use of this drug with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended to stabilizing the therapeutic concentration until stabilization of the mirror, because the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus may be increased (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Hence, Agenerase not may be used together with oral formulary Midazolam (see section 4.3), while using an example of agostatic Midazolam intention.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the current use of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors have a possible increase in plasma level by Midazolam to the 3-4-distance.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If Methadon is administered along with Amprenavir, the patient should therefore be monitored on Opiatentssymptome, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the only low reliability of historical Compare, no recommendation can be given as any recommendation, as the Amprenavir is administered at Methadon if Amprenavir is administered at Methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">For the same-time gift of Warfarin or other oral antioagulants, together with Aovase, a reinforced control of INR (International normalities ratio) is recommended due to a fattenuation or gain of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contrast is not expected, therefore alternative methods are recommended for conception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same-time gift of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2027">Conclusions on the relevance of particular mutations or mutationsmell can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to move the current interpretations for analysis of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phänotypical resistance regulating analyses clinical validating systems can be used in conjunction with the genetic data to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease-resistant insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Firms, distributing diagnostic resistance tests, have clinically-phänotypic cut-offs (isolating points) for FPV / RTV that can be applied to the interpretation of an resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Amprenavir associated pattern creates a certain crucial resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remain in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on crucial resistance between Amprenavir and other protective advisers for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients (one of which the resistance to Lopinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 insurks), Indeavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 insulation), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 insulation).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Reversa, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease-resistant insulation; the content of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations to isolates isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early break of a dissient therapy is recommended to keep the proliferation of a variety of mutations in boundaries that may affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day based in combination with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with Ritonavir (NRTI) or a standard of therapy (standard of care, SOC) with an PI, mainly with lowest Ritonavir "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">A hundred and sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with a weighted virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI, and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced the non-differentiation of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average change from the output value (AAUCMB) in plasma to 16 weeks in plasma, with a non-subsidy threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of effectiveness of unparalleled atrophy is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was obtained in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It was not a low dosiged Ritonavir simultaneously; the majority of patients with PI pre-treated patients had received at least one (78%) or two (42%) together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the study included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml at a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared with the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data was to be considered to be considered an expected benefit of "unparalleled" Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) until the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax which decreased by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) of the food intake remained uninfluenced by the food intake and influenced the extent and the rate of reorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to about 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and it can close to a large volume of penetration of Amprenavir from the blood circulation.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in total concentration in plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir which remains the active ingredient probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir constant remain constant during the percentage of free active ingredients during the dosing intervals in the steady state on the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, the CYP3A4 is to induced or inating or insistence or a substrate of CYP3A4, which will be given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The treatment of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice a day or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amprenavir exposition as with adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is a solution of 14% less biodable than out of the capsules; therefore, Agenerates solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligraph basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney disease is relatively low for elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to Amprenavir-plasma welding comparable to healthy subjects according to a dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>

<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data in humans, both of clinical trials as well as from therapeutic use, however, however, some evidence for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro test tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphocytes test, microcore test on rats and chromosomenaberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes, was Amprenavir neither mutagenic nor conotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored in clinical daily life by measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of the alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, clinical trials was observed no significant liver toxicity in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies to the toxicity at young, treated at a age of 4 days, showed both high mortality in the control of the control and ampire treated animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasmaexposition, which was significantly higher (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposition among the therapeutic dosage, however, a number of minor changes including thymuselongation and lesser skelage changes were observed on a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If oasase capsules without the amplification of Ritonavir (Boopholstery) must be used to be used higher doses of agitonavir (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, however, the safety of the medicines was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured (by using its effect on reducing the Gag concentration in the urine and reference to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyms caused the Gag concentration in the urine around 60%, and half of treated children had a normal liver on the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyms in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, stomach pain, pain in limbal (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects under five years old, increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardio (accelerated heart rate), fever and bulk frost.</seg>
<seg id="2281">In patients, aldurazyms may not react more sensitive (allergic) on laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not used.</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be updated every year all new information that may be known, testing and update these summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">In fact, the manufacturer of Aldurazyms is preserved to observe the Aldurazyms, regarding the reactions to the Infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. an approval for the transport of aldurazyms throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a combination form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using a combined DNA technology using CHO mammal cellular cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovarian of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">In patients Aldurazyms is intreated for patients with secured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency), to treat non-neurologic manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with aldurazyms should be provided by a doctor in treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient could reduce this, all 15 minutes in single steps will be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients cannot be recommended dosing scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with alduryms treated patients can develop infusion-related reactions, which are defined as a related side effects that occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also be fully monitored, and the infusion of aldurazyms should only be provided in an appropriate clinical environment, in the rebelting facilities for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, we expect nearly all patients IgG antibody against laronidase, usually within 3 months from treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibody or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated by aldurazyms (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As much experience concerning recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, must be careful because of the theoretical increased risk-action after a reduction of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of the Infusion with medications (Antihistamines and / or Antipyretika) to minimize the potential infusion related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or medium-severe infusion-related reaction, the treatment with Antihistamines and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should repay and / or a reduction of infusion rate on half of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of single, severe infusion-related reaction needs to be stopped, until the symptoms were brought to the decline, a treatment with Antihistamines and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be taken up with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (Antihistamines and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen / / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, which entered the previous reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyms should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of interference is treated by laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not run directly or indirect effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Because there is no data in newborn, which were exposed to Laronidase over the breast milk, is recommended to kill during treatment with alduryms.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects in clinical trials were classified as infusion-related reactions, who were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in study participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drugs actions in connection with aldurazyms, while the phase 3- trial and their extension in a total of 45 patients were observed in the following table: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with serious MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory symptoms and lungs in the prehistoric times, even heavy reactions proceed, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted drugs effects in connection with aldurazyms, while a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly heavier form and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, it came within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconous version, with a heavier verification form mostly in a month to a seroconist (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the Phase 3 trial (or until the present outbreaks out of the study) in 13 / 45 patients no recurring antibodies (RIP) Assay retraceable bodies before, including 3 patients, in which it never had to Serokonward.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lacking up to low antibody levels had a robust confusion of Gag-Spiegels in Harn, while patients with high antibody titers to establish a variable reduction of Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed marginally up to low neutralising inhibitor on the enzymatic Laronidone activity in vitro, which does not affect the clinical efficacy and / or decreasing of Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies were not in connection with the incidence of unwanted drugs actions, even if the occurrence of unwanted drugs tugs are typically preserved with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Exercising for the Enzymeric Therapy is located in one for the hydrolysis of accumulated substance and preventing a further accumulation of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous Infusion, laronidase is removed from the circulation and of cells into the lysosomes, most likely about manor 6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms were randomised in a randomised, double-controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at age 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of the patients had been recruited, was the majority of patients from the middle phenomenotype and only one patient was the heavy phenomenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an forcated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to rise 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of expected FEV and the absolute salary in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study where they received for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with aldurations treated patients on the placebo group to improve the lung function and the deability which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study showed a improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyms / Aldurazyms group and 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyms group as from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FEV is not significantly statistically significantly and the absolute lung volumes increased significantly more proportional to the body size.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomic treatment consisted of 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of Gag-Spiegel was found in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinine), which remained constant at the beginning of the academic year.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease-manifestation between the patients who was carried out clinically significant changes related to nine patients (58%), a change in 10 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a decrease in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one year-old open phase 2 study carried out in which mainly the security and pharmacokinic of aldurazyms were examined at 20 patients at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years (16 patients with the heavy duty form and 4 with middle-form form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosing of increased GAG- Mirror for increased GAG- mirrors in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and a weight increase (n = 3) demonstrated after the Z-Score for the younger patients with the heavy duty form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the average verification form, whereas no progress in cognitive development were limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study, investigations of pharmacodynamic effects were performed on the Gag mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be able to represent the difficulties with weekly infusions, but it is not demonstrated that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two doses can be equivalently.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will assess any new information which will be available, and if necessary, the summary of the pharmaceutical features will be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed slowdown together with the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of pemetrexed in its active form are lighter than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of medication, and a longer working duration of cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For treatment of the malignant Pleuramesothelioms, Alimta was studied in a study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-individual lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were treated in a study on 571 patients with local or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy with effects of docetaxel (another pharmaceuticals against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta also compared with gemcitabine (another medicines against cancer) and both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients with 2 dose reduction of toxicity or non-hemattoxicity or non-hematology toxicity in grade 3 or 4 neur- continue to apply from grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials did not notice that at age 65 years or over, compared to patients in the age of 65 years, an increased secondary risk report consists of age 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non-sufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials were necessary for patients with a cancer agent of ≥ 45 ml / min, which have no dose adaptations required for all patients recommended Dosage adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with an liver function of &gt; 1.5 times of the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminase values (in the absence of liver metastasis) or &gt; 5.0 fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver lungs) does not have been studied in the study.</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophilic number, thrombozytention, and maximum non-hematology toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 of haemmatological toxicity as Neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was diagnosed when a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients have to be treated with pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophetic lactic measure to reduce waste-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be used through an additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as Antiemetonic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">Treatment in patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance represents an chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the loan of Darm.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adult, chemotherapies received, which are strong or moderate dissoluble for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, the severe triggers for nausea and vomiting, showed 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi treated with Aloxi (132 of 223), compared with 57% of the patients with Ondansetron treated patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">For chemotherapies, the regular expression of nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi treated with Aloxi, compared to 69% of patients with Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dagasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for traffic of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer prevention and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one before the chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colorectal passage should be monitored with anamnesty orchipation or signs of a subacute Ileus according to injection of injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3-antagonists, however, is instructed with the same gift of Paleonosetron with medicines referred the QT interval extended or in patients where the QT- interval is extended or die for such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemotherapeutics, Aloxi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy or to be used for treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, pallonosetron inhibited against tumor activity of the five investigated chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose pallonosetron and a steady statues concentration of the Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6-inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one on a population based pharmaceutical analysis (Amiodaron, Celectrinal, Cimetidin, fluoxetin, Haloperidol, Paroxetin, Haloperidol, Paroxetin, Haloperidol, sertralin and Terbinafin) no significant impact on Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not used, therefore Palonosetron is not applied for pregnant women, unless it is required of treated doctor as required.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 mcg (total of 633 patients), at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and orchipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of insensitive reactions and reactions in the appointment (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing reviews.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar incidents showed unwanted events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose related relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, due to the large volume volumes, it is probably not effective treatment in a Aloxiety overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blindings, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate-drug chemotherapy with a ≤ 50mg / m2 dose phosphorubicin and 250 mcg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg of unansetron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time period 7.3 hours), which was given a day 1 without Dexamethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a heavily emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and oxarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of Paleonosetron were treated with patients who were treated in Day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-etogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy was summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron based on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters of the Qtc intervalls were comparable to the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of the clinical investigations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block at ventriculars De- and Repricularisation involved in the shareholders and the duration of the shareholder.</seg>

<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous gift follows an initial withdrawal of PlasmaConcentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminated half-value of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area of concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportionally proportional for dosing in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift from Palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses, the seronosetron Plasmaconcentration was measured at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinic simulations, that at once a daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron achieved a total exposition (AUC0- ∞) with the following intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was measured at 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated above the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, compared to Palonosetron by less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies to metabolization that CYP2D6 and, in smaller sizes that were involved in the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron made an unchangeable active ingredient approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolacal injury, the total physical body must be 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>

<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are lying than sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 from preclinical trials took part that Palonosetron can be blocked in very high concentrations of Ionic forms that are involved in ventricular De- and Repricularisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose) spoke in about the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure of liver cells, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pancreas, pancreas, anniermark) and skin irritation with rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not complete, but because of the used high dosages and Aloxi used in human application, the relevance of these results is rated as low as humans.</seg>

<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humanarzneige (CHMP) resulted in the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo has survived against the risks involved in the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazarations, shutdown and wounds wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the transport of Altargo into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients where patients no improvements occurred within two to three days, are supposed to be considered and an alternative therapy is considered to be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a Sensibilical or severe local iriritation through the application of Retapamulin salbe, the treatment is broken down and a reasonable alternative therapy of the infection will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not supported for treating infections in which MRSA is known as a reject (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary studies, the effectiveness of retapamina in patients with infections, caused by a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered, if after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvement or deterioration of infested point is considered.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the current usage of Retapamillo and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to its low plasma concentrations that have been achieved after topical application of small skin, or inferiorating wounds in vivo is not expected to expect in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the same tumor gift of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the medium retapamiconic acid (0-24) and Cmax. topical application of 1% retapambulae in weaving skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure of topical use of patients, doses must not be required if topical retapamiculin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction according to oral gestion and are inadequate regarding a statement on the birth and the fötale / post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">The retaprosulin salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clear indication and the application of the treatment of a systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In the decision whether the breastfeeding will continue / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continued / ends, between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials at 2,150 patients with superficial skin infections, Altargo applied, was the most common adverse reactions of errors that concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">The approach Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance called by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (former Pleurotus passeaanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effects of the bactericulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein isolate due to a certain binder of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binding of other ribosomal interagating antibacterial fabrics.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the engulative protein L3 is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of ribosomal P-binding and the Peptidyltransferred to the region.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through the engagement of inhibiting Pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, blocked some P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the reason of local currency of the resistance of Retapamulin at least some infections form, a consultation should be applied through experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in-vitro activity of Retapamulin, opposite S.AUREUS, regardless of whether the insulation is sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-response to the treatment of S.AUREUS, the presence of stimulus with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamiculin salbe daily under occlusion on intakte and sloped out skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% retaprosulin salbe twice daily for 5 days to the topian treatment of secondary wounds. single plasma was collected.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on the days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of Medicalation and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording of men after topical use of 1% salbe to 200 cm2 of weep skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamesIC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative Metabolism of retapamina in human liver microses was primarily associated with CYP3A4, lower stake of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver of the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as one of two doses of existing vaccinations, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may possibly be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix is only used when the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that it can be led out of the existing vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a collection dose against hepatitis A or B is available, Ambirix or other hepatitis A- or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by creating the immune system (the natural downward of the body), "how it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and the surface antigens as "foreign" and its antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix included the same components such as the Twinrix Adult vaccine since 1996 and has been approved a vaccine of Twinrix Kids since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used for protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given as one of three doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix Adult ingredients contain some of the data that uses the use of Twinrix adults, also as cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indekator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection of anti-protective antibody.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection of anti-protective antibody against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the protection from Ambirix in a six-month distance between injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headscarf, appetite, pain at injection point, validity, matter (fatigue) and frizability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react in patients who may have to react more sensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, including a approval for the traffic of Ambirix in the entire territory</seg>
<seg id="2739">The base range for the primers with Ambirix which consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is on the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection vaccinated by hepatitis A, as well as Hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding month, vaccinated by using a combination simulator.</seg>
<seg id="2741">According to the combination of primers, anti-Hepatitis B - Surface antigen (anti-HbsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antigen values are in the same size, as after vaccination with the respective monovals vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not completely secured if private competent persons that are addressed to an hepatitis A- vaccination, which may also need a collection of vaccination, because they are not protected by the immune memory by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection pipes, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of vaccine appropriate ways of medical treatment and monitoring must be immediately available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the modular scheme is recommended with the combination simulating, the 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">For the immune system and persons with disruptions of the immune system, the anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody must be reached, so that the gift of another vaccines can be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since a traded injection or intramusculular administration could lead to a suboptimal impaired success, these injection paths should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">When Thrombozytopenia or blood disorders, Ambirix, however, can be injected, since it can occur in these cases after intramusculinary gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was introduced in the form of a separate injection systems simultaneously using a combined diphther-, inactivated Poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with a combined measur- mumina vaccine, the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients suffering from immunsuppressive therapy or in patients with immundefects must be received, that may not have sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was kidnapped with 3 vaccines of such formulation in adults, prevalence, Gastroenteritis, headaches, and fever comparable with the incidence that was observed at former Thiomerates and preservative vaccine formulation was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine sockets were administered to 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared to the 3-cans combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matters at a check-based basis, Ambirix, but not on a check-based base unit.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects, compared with 39.1% at subjects according to the gift of a 3-cans combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccine cycle reported 66,4% of the subjects who had given the Ambirix which had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination of clay, which were vaccinated with the 3-dose combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The prevalence of matters was comparable per proband (i.e. over the total vaccine cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received Ambirix was compared with 36,2% for subjects who received 3 cans of combination-simulations).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The prevalence of prey pain and matters was low and comparable to the administration of the combination-simpler with the 3-cans vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study with 1- and 11-year-old vaccines, the appearance of localreactions and general interactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable with the 3-cans combinations of hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B virus.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequency response of pain (on injection point) per dose, not per proxy.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines, which over severe adverse events during the 2-cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA- Units formed with a combination of hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis C virus, was statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the serocation rates were carried out for the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for the month 6.</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serocation rates for anti-hbs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for the month 6 was administered dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study that was conducted at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses had been created by Ambirix and 147 for the standard combinations of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people, whose immunity was able to evaluate the seroprotational rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 to the gift of the 3-dose significant higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunobtains in clinical comparison study were 1- and 11-year-old one month after the completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies there were vaccinated either a 2-canned vaccine scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units, formalinactive hepatitis A virus and 10µg of combined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were at the time of the Grundimmunisation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months accine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens was comparable to both antigens, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- and including 15-year-olds showed that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months accine is comparable to the 0-12 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose Ambirix in the second year of life with the collection of a combined diphther-, inactivated Poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib), or with the first dose of a combined measles-mps-cubs was sufficient response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study that was carried out at 3 doses of the present formulation in adults, showed the present formulation of similar seroprotator and seroconference rates as for the former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is based on both directions and to investigate sight on some foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix could not protect against an infection with hepatitis A- or hepatitis B virus, even when the complete vaccine series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you have been infected with hepatitis A- or hepatitis B virus have already been infected with hepatitis A- or hepatitis B virus (though you don't feel unlikely or ill or ill) a vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it may be that the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient, and the person is not being protected against any or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at Ambirix, should be vaccinated at separate places and possibly different limbs.</seg>

<seg id="2805">On the basis of data, which have been known since the release of the first approval for the business administration, CHMP has been attributable to the benefit of the benefit of the benefit of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was employed only in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this product is limited to its low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonites can also be used for patients at the age of more than one month with inomplettem Enzymdefect or hyperammonium Encephalopathy (epherbulation) in prehistoric times.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is administered - split by several single-outlets - split up to several single travellers (through the stomach's leading tube) or noses (through the nose in the stomach's leading tube) is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a similar study because of the Ammonites did not compare with any other treatment or placebo (a apparent treatment, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonites can also benefit from appetite, an absolute acid content in blood, depression, headaption, headache, nausea, nausea, corrupt, nausea, constipation, skin irritation, unacceptable body or weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Humanitarian pruning (CHMP) resulted in the end that ammonium is prevents with disruptions of the urine cycle with high ammoniac values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium was approved among "exceptional circumstances, as because of the disease the disease has only limited information on this product.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The application is indicated in all patients with which a complete Enzymes had already manifested in the newborns (within the first 28 days of days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with late-manifest form (inkompletter Enzymes), it is an indication for use when in the Anamnese an hyperammonemic Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to sleep tablets or for patients with slurysfunction, AMMONAPS are also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Daily dosage will be charged individually taking into consideration of protein tolerance and the development of the necessary daily protein intake of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2817">After the previous clinical experience the normal dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of 20 kg, as well as for growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from Carbamylphosphatsynthetase or Ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is necessary in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must be arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered with strokes, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulzera, if the tablets are not instant immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenyl rate which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used with congestive heart failure or severe cardiac insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and inhuming clinical trials are only used to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As Metabolization and excretion of Sodium phenylbutyrate about the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contrasted (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous gift of Phenyl acetate to young rats (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal valves and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral Synapsen and a reduced number of functional nervous in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted if Phenyl acetate is eliminated in breast milk, and this reason is the use of AMMONAPS during the breastfeeding time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS represented at 56% of the patients at least one unwanted event (AE) and 78% of the unwanted events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS in conjunction with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A more probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18 year-old anoretic female patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy, serious hypothesia, armpytopenia, peripheral reropathy and pancreatic.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of a overdose occurred in a 5 months old small child with a regular intake of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of Phenyl acetate, which showed an intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosing neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenyl acetate is a metabolically active compound that conjugated by acetylacetylglutamine, conjugate on the kidneys by acetylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometric is seen Phenyl acetylglutamine with a urea urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenyl acetylglutamine can therefore be regarded as an alternative carrier to the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urine cycle can be assumed that every gram of invasive sodium phenyl rate between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early as early and the treatment is immediately going to improve survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast of the earliest development of the disease with occurring of the first symptoms in newborns grew almost always infist, and the disease continued to make treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticky Analogeine within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium polyphenylacetate), it was possible to increase survival rate in postpartal (but within the first life month) diagnosed cases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of the pregnancy and the survival rate was 100%, but even during these patients there was a time with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotes form of Ornithintranscarbamylase-Mangel), which were treated by a hyperammonemic Encephalopathy and a protein-reduced diet was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurologic deficits are also hardly reversible and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological state.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenyl acetate is oxidised to Phenyl acetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney with glutamine, with the phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g of Sodium phenylbutyrate and patients with disruptions according to individual and repetric doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also analysed by intravenous gift of Sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or Phenyl acetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g Sodium phenylbutyrate in tablets, 15 minutes after taking measuring plasma concentrations were detected by phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyccytes, or hemoglobinopathies was after different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day) there is no phenylacetate in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean Phenyl acetate concentrations in the plasma concentration on the third day, five times higher than the first gifts.</seg>

<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteine should be kept within the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from Carbamylphosphatsynthetase or Ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is necessary in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram Sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenyl rate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat futes were exposed to the birth of Phenyl acetate (active Metabolit of phenylbutyrate), it came to lesions in the pyramid of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A more probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18 year-old anoretic female patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy, serious hypothesia, armpytopenia, peripheral reropathy and pancreatic.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute Koronarsyndroms" (ACS), for example with unstable Angina (a form of pain in chest basket) without "ST- Hebrews" (an anomal measuring value at the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox is used to decrease bleeding in patients who undergo one PCI will be given a higher dose, and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This may contribute to patients with angina or heart failure to detecting the blood flow to the heart and the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the study on the treatment of ACS, with the effect of angiox in all-some gift or in connection with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, a different medicinal) with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anti-agulans) and an GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often found a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a lock), and additionally received other medicinal detention of blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attack or Revascularization) after 30 days or a year, as well as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent one PCI, Angiox was the same effective as the heparin, except for severe blood disorders, with which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used by patients who may possibly be insensitive (allergic) against bivalirudin, other shepudine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must not be applied in patients who had a blood dispersist, as well as people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or disinfection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Humanarzneige (CHMP) resulted in the conclusion that Angiox is at the treatment of ACS and a PCI an annotable substitute for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. a approval for the transport of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndroms (IA / NSTEMI) patients with an emergency stop or if an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous Bolusal of 0.1 mg / kg followed by a infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patients had been carried out in another consecutive episode, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, and the infusion for the duration of impact on 1.75 mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2893">Following the PCI requirements for clinical creation, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Directly before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg shall be given, followed by a infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous detachment of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose followed by intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the input.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a very few Bolus treatment by Angiox was not studied and is not recommended, even if a short PCI input is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">This value (ACT after 5 minutes) shortened to less than 225 seconds, should take place a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the delivery of a lower ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted drug should be carefully administered, and the Bolusdose rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is not necessary, provided the 1.75 mg / kg Infusionsdosis is used correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with medium-severe non-functional restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is treated with a PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS grade or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>

<seg id="2983">To the substances that enhancing bleeding activity and increase the incline of hypoglycemia, antiopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetin, monoamine-oxidation, salicylic acid, salicylic antibiotics, salicylic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, among the effect of sympatholytics such as Betablures, Clonidin, Guanethidine and Reserpin, the symptoms of adrenergen have been shot down or are missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies in the reproductive dicial studies show no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin in relation to the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether Insulinglulisin occur in human breast milk, but generally, insulin is neither into breast milk, nor is absorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are known from clinical trials related to system organic, grouped according to system organs (very common: ≥ 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000;</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy will be missed continuously, injection point within the injection ranges, can occur in the episode a liodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglyccoli with consciousness can be given by a intramusculars or subjutanen injection of Glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is treated by one in accordance with intravenous gift from glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose projection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to avoid the ur- matter for the heavy hypoglycemia and similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Sulin lowers blood sugar level by the stimulation of the peripheral glucose (especially by skeleton musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of Glucosystem production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at the subkutans Ga- be performed faster by insulin's insulin, and the active time is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- a insulin-relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, a dose proportional glucosmic effects, and with 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportional increase in the glucosystem impact, exactly like humanise ulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-ulisin has a double so fast active effect as normal human medicine and achieves the complete glucosystem effects about 2 hours earlier than humanist.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Data from the data was confident that at an application of insulin-ulisin 2 minutes before meals a comparable postprandiale glycemic control is achieved by human normal insulin, which will be given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulinglulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprangeal control was reached by human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If Insulinglulisin 15 minutes after the meal is applied, a comparable glycemic control like of human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- grooves before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, the 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 Min.) before the meal was given (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, the 2 minutes (NORMAL - previously) was given before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - later) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
