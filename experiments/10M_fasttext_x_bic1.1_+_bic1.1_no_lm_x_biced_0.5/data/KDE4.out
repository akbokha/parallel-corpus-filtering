what is a digital data management - beyond the fashion work , after the picture was taken after the picture was taken up to the final issue and the permanent store . each of the user takes up , sc@@ ans or digital photos saves a form of digital data management . most of us do not do this in a system@@ atic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your images . we focus on the procedure for digital phot@@ og@@ ra@@ ffle the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; we consider the download , ren@@ aming , re@@ pos@@ itory , ability to guarantee , re@@ act , waiting and export image files .

met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined according to your definition data , information on or a documentation of other data , which will be administ@@ rated by an application or surrounding area .
I feel at claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will definitely not know how many photos you will need to store both in a database than even in the image files , and a safe archiv@@ ing on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats free .
the first what you do and know before you have to adap@@ t some information structure in contrast to your system . your image files will have to save whether you want to store them on a reserv@@ ist &amp; etc ; consider that you must change sometimes on a larger image .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found in a year several times on the same place . if you get enough photos , you &apos;ll also use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then you can print a file for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing pictures , archives , working processes , constant supply of pictures are on different them@@ es and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % labour files and you will not want to organ@@ ise your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking @-@ processing simple . separate new from old files .
the separation of the original and working files , simp@@ lif@@ y a backup strategy and migration . they will always know if you are looking for a original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the options to activ@@ ate the met@@ ad@@ ata in the settings side of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . if you forget that ex@@ if@@ ications and IP@@ TC data can be stored in the file , then you can select the met@@ ad@@ ata out of the database into the files , select the appropriate point to the respective item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change that ? it is a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attri@@ butes . these are of course the most important ones .
now start the real work , since you should select any photo words , descriptions and an evaluation . of course you can select all images that need the same attri@@ bute and select the value . this makes sense where you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let us take a key@@ word , keywords , like you want to proceed with other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ on@@ ym@@ s for the same thing .
if you are catalog@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded words , then becomes &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; automatically add the images to the right place . the changes of the hier@@ archy is not a problem and can be easily accessible by using a under@@ way to another . the changed words are from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
the graph shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata shows . this is a very rough replica , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are all images .
enough of the words - the next section refers to descriptions or comments , the third important tools to catalog@@ us your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos to see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are certain to interest as your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach dress . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the landing area of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after the landing is again , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the lab@@ elling has been completely changed .
for other the photos of view is the title probably more important than the picture yourself to create a story . remember that the key is the meaning of viewer to help him to help Him about the motive that you don &apos;t understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if there are the strength only with a lab@@ elling for itself alone .
with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you can save a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alph@@ abet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , you can also export your testim@@ on@@ ies to your wishes to the lab@@ elling and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you must tell the story so for the opening times a second time .
do you remember the time before GPS ? when you had to find another town without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the beginning of the sp@@ ati@@ al presentation is now available with light speed .
the possibilities for ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ ation are already in@@ numer@@ able and become a pro@@ sper@@ ity . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travel with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures at the recording location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; using Google Maps Maps .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ rights is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of copyright to remove limit@@ ations above the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also applies in all changed versions , so also for works of others .
the following description says that information on the out@@ skirts of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; as information is depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ on@@ ymous with plate and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photograph . if it was not desired to be changed , the name of the photographer or organization is not to be changed . this field is neither comm@@ as nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as part@@ itions .
aut@@ onomy ( syn@@ on@@ ymous with author ) : linked with the author . this field contains the working designation of the photographer . examples of the photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent photographer or independent photographer . as this is a ver@@ mer@@ k to the author , this field must be filled .
Editor ( Syn@@ onym for Contri@@ but@@ or ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld to identify the photo . if the photographer is listed here . if the picture is a ware@@ house , then the group / agency will offer the picture here .
it is very important the author and copyright sections , although this does not have any protection against ab@@ use . each of those who have a bit more than basic met@@ ad@@ ata , it can only be used in the image embedded met@@ ad@@ ata . for individuals , this is only for the majority of your photos only of low interest . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . in the near future , it will provide such a tool for st@@ acking processing .
topics : record errors , plate failure , ECC , transmission error , age@@ ing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ erv@@ or@@ ating , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ st@@ itions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs out on the road or a fire . this kind of losses might happen to you also at traditional paper photos or negative . in this section you can find problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data mining company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss .
in order to t@@ ack@@ le the problem with CDs / DVDs , you can &apos;t want to get more than a few years old . of course you can get more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the pieces of a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you think it is in your di@@ meas@@ ur@@ able room .
CD / DVD dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can easily reduce this risk in which you are good dis@@ ks and good recording equipment . the top DVD recording files are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it is so to choose the right .
CDs and DVDs are very inc@@ enti@@ ated for errors , even if you &apos;re just written only . 75 % of data are only effective data , the rema@@ inder are needed for the form@@ ulation and the check@@ s@@ men . despite this massive protection , they are using chemical aging , Ultra@@ violet light , cr@@ at@@ zer , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works with CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disk drives , hard drives , flash@@ media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray disc seem to store the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus has almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all of which CDs and DVDs was also valid for Blu @-@ ray Disk .
burn slowly with a good recording studio on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . Read all the media with a description , date &amp; author license and later on a clean , dark dry and before animals shel@@ tered the information on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece hardware or software that can read this media .
dis@@ si@@ ves keep your statistics for themselves . her manufacturer include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study about the error mechan@@ isms of hard drives : dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ers
shortly : dis@@ ks are running on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature , the frequencies are not established immediately . some of SM@@ ART is the most common fail@@ ures . these are especially readers and an old counter . the expected lifetime of life ranges between 4 and 5 years .
this is just around the complete loss of losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you may have backed data loss due to a power if you have backed up the files but these losses can normally be used without any major problems .
while most electrical devices electricity are not far off . these can take serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware mot@@ her@@ boards , dis@@ rup@@ ts mot@@ her@@ boards and other def@@ ects . protect themselves before the un@@ avoid@@ able that led to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against electricity tips is an over@@ load protection . this is a device that is absor@@ bed in the form of energy flas@@ hes and the rest is available usually in the form of a plug @-@ in strip . remember that not each coil strip also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you are searching for a over@@ load protection , then you should pay the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that he protects the protection against ligh@@ tening strikes .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be connected to your computer , you should also make sure all the periph@@ er@@ als and cable mod@@ ems can also include a telephone connection for your modem . other offers connectivity options for the co@@ axial cables of the cable mod@@ ems and the television card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ load protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ e@@ books and thus also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for the road .
while a over@@ voltage protection your system is based on smaller variations in the electricity lines . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of un@@ profit@@ able data . it can therefore be mean@@ ing@@ fully to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ voltage , these tools will be able to save your data . some models allow you to save your data . some models allow you to get the same quality requirements like a over@@ load protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your RE@@ CH@@ N@@ ER@@ SYSTEM can be exposed and compare its security in curr@@ ents with the cost to avoid this . a qualit@@ atively high quality over@@ load protection can be used for less than € ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you think . at the end you should always remember any cable before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as backup under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a secure target for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store data on data .
they are compared to the hard dis@@ ks , however , too expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data about compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general safety solution . therefore it is slowly .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yah@@ oo ) and the photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online storage services . your professional version provides you more available , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dram@@ atically . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed in reality .
from view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission error are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocols , and with the big companies included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ able .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transfer chain in the computer . all transfers are due to transfer errors . the file system needs to be used at least the data integr@@ ity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one has occurred when it happened in your hardware . all this dis@@ rup@@ tions remain incor@@ rec@@ t until you should have any protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought that it seems to be remember@@ ed . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more safe data way than that is in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source for transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ventions within the data flow . at normal file systems remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently un@@ affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , thousands of errors will be seen per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who are available with plate missing on lower level . it is open source , with many pat@@ ents and is available under one of the G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available for this article in English .
Or@@ acle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still using the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechan@@ isms that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the core .
this is not appreci@@ ated that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses in notebook and 46 % at work@@ station systems . with not@@ e@@ books already the proportion of the@@ ft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most chis@@ els . it is limited to a lower damage , e.g. the@@ ft or new installations . Apple users have known only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; there was no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less vul@@ ner@@ able for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to set the widespread fil@@ es@@ ystems . find a very good original article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and loss : false , only the speed of trial process during one operation is higher and a defined status is avo@@ ided . if however , a file is not fully stored before the problem happened , she is lost .
viruses are the largest threat to digital data : false , the@@ ft and human error are the main cause for data loss .
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 blocks of fundamental physical limits . community is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today cameras go in direction of 10 Meg@@ apixels . even if this resolution is already very high for compact cameras . even DSLR Cam@@ eras have a limit of 10 @-@ 12 megapixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full size sensor ( 24x@@ 36mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you are not responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are frequent in each year of a database and test this fuse before you &apos;re using any haz@@ ard@@ ous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of plates or the size of hard dis@@ ks .
supp@@ ose a day your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , light@@ ning strikes have you happ@@ ier if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster suggest@@ s loc@@ ally and destro@@ ys one amount . for@@ got an air@@ plane : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ie@@ ves are dangerous enough . they usually affect an entire room or the whole house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ erv@@ or@@ ality always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses to the steps into the neighbour@@ ing house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above as already said is a more common reason for a data loss in spite of secur@@ ing the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete secur@@ ing : a complete secur@@ ing all files are secured . it is a mom@@ ents of no history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete system . generates a complete mom@@ ents of two time points : the complete security and the last differenti@@ ation .
inc@@ ur@@ able backup : a backup of files have been changed since the last backup . several mom@@ ents have to restore any time . this fuse comes back to such a backup system with the exception that it is only ab@@ bed and not ongoing .
R@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily setup easily on your machines . in contrast to Sk@@ ri@@ pt @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scrip@@ ts , only the difference of files are really changed . this happens now and if you want to increase safety over ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another op@@ aque medium .
this approach will be enough time to discover losses and restore again . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly mom@@ ents for each month and a mom@@ ents for each month . any further development should be done manually , after you have a complete review .
topics : data stored IP@@ TC information , associated with X@@ MP files , original keeping , memory , scal@@ ability , media , can find pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment ... , use of the Internet .
with this valuable photos the next 40 year , it is about that time in you are really interested in you , because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ predic@@ table with cau@@ tion , you must consider everything that today is predicted with cau@@ tion . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain qu@@ alities . if less variations you have used in the past , so it &apos;s easier to evalu@@ ate the questions of the future .
this question is supposed to be addressed via the ex@@ plan@@ ations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for each . if you have an old system that it is important for reading your images , then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for a later usage .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : anyway , if you change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ uses technology , or your file format , you should review your library and needs to convert to a newer standard . keep in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialized pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means it always means .
let &apos;s go out of which you plan to have up the scal@@ ability with plant and partition . they don &apos;t want to copy on a dedicated plate or partition . * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transferred to a new sheet :
check out with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but they don &apos;t hang them .
s &amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / s@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; resi@@ dual FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ z@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary
open source standards have the major advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software anymore , you can read this yourself . this task will be easier for a year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format the slowly from the market . they should no longer use it .
PNG has been replaced as an open source standard as an open source standard . it can be lost , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transpar@@ ency . PNG can also use relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression . this format would like to recommend you to save your images .
TIFF was widely used as a picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression sal@@ ary algorith@@ m ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . this problem is that this format is adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw file format , it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is ob@@ li@@ ged to use the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera update is already available and we hope to use the compet@@ itors Canon and Nikon es sometimes any time .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe is introduced to replace the X@@ MP technology to replace the &apos; s &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . the file information will be supported with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers go before a original of your photo , mostly in the raw format , as it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file and the image file and how it is reasonable for the link between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ file and the image file . therefore , you should transl@@ ate whether you use DNG than containers and put everything there .
the Dublin Core met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that support a large area of influ@@ ences and business models . to the activities of DC@@ MI and the DC@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and ex@@ plan@@ atory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and intern@@ s .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the cam@@ eram@@ an are , you can use this as a temporary fuse .
convert raw files to DNG and save this in your shell pos@@ itory . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine , you can use external programs . if you want to add the images again with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut off to other programs .
Prot@@ ect the worked images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , enc@@ ode in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; in the section , you can find pictures you can already add to your hard disk , but you can already add many advanced settings for import@@ ing pictures to your Al@@ ben@@ dat@@ enb@@ ank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; connect this with the machine , switch the camera to the display mode and switch them . another description of you will find in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , this will start with your camera . if the connection is made , a heel indicator will be displayed on the lower end and the examples of all photos on the camera . some cameras do not appear , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for any file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera form@@ ations to each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of a entry or his met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information to be stored intern@@ ally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded from your computer . NOTE that in some digital cameras do not see all information available .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer not@@ ation , GPS etc . of the image . these information is the same as the met@@ ad@@ ata @-@ side panel from the main window of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; or the image processing . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata were not available with some digital cameras .
the eas@@ iest way to download photos on your computer , the click on the button to download and then the selection of all camera in a single album in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; . when downlo@@ ading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to download the pictures sure you can delete pictures from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the default selection by default . once you select the photos , use the button Download and then select button . the button chosen is available as long as you select some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is not available . these pictures have not yet been updated to you . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the case . if you choose this option , you will only download the new pictures .
if you are using the buttons on or Selected combination , a dialog appears where you can read the target album where you can read the target album as normal file , you can read in the section My albums . then select the target album out of the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and dig@@ ic@@ am ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can choose to remove them from the camera . if you want only delete a few , then you must select that first and then delete extinc@@ tion .
NOTE that there is no possibility to re@@ cover you from the camera you will be deleted from the camera . you should be carefully check if you want to remove them from the camera . if you want to er@@ ase it from the camera , you should make it much faster on the camera , as it is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ ename for the photos are often not appreci@@ ated . the fil@@ ename will be deleted . this may also be mean@@ ing@@ fully to integ@@ rate pictures , the date and time where the image has been done to integ@@ rate the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options to shooting and sp@@ elling holder . if you use this latter option , automatically stops a file per day .
the options on the transfer opens three more options that are carried out before the photos on the plate will be stored on the record standard . if you select that , the corresponding entries will be cop@@ ied from Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct a date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you wish to use another date format as the default format , you can add e.g. in the processing field of pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for further adjust@@ ments , you should read the help of command str@@ ing@@ time .
if you are using the camera file names , you have the opportunity to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters . or in large letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; for a photo is displayed below the name , which will be stored in the preview of the camera . their settings are stored for ren@@ aming and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time record . not all cameras put this information . in the section of page met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that set your camera into the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally enabled , and when your camera doesn &apos;t want this information , lets you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the button extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
when your camera is made available on the date , you can read &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; this sub@@ albums are based on the picture sequence . all images will be downloaded on the same date . not all cameras provide this information on the same date . in the section side panel Met@@ a data you can read , which would have embedded information your camera into the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in that case you want to change this option directly in the finish album . if you want to change this option , you need to select this option on the lower end of the window at the bottom end of the window .
the eas@@ iest way photos from its calcul@@ ator to your camera is the button Download . then select upload . select the file choice dialog &amp; k@@ de ; if you can select the files that you can be up@@ loaded , you can also choose to select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is read , asks you , where the pictures should be loaded up . a file selection dialog appears . choose the desired folder , press OK to start the upload . the pictures are not er@@ ased out of your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , it is a position that can be displayed in length and latitude . the determination of data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LON@@ AS , to the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photography , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geograph@@ ical place . not everyone uses a plane to cardi@@ ov@@ ate GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural bure@@ ros and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can send a postcard to another &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; user you want to loc@@ ate the location of the photos , or just write this aspect document , it &apos;s good the position data of a photos .
the question is , how are the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that the data comes into this fields ? there are at least three ways to reach these fields . directly with the correct hardware , via a successor of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geograph@@ ical correspondence ( manual ) , and last about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is no camera which has a GPS unit integrated . but there are some that work with GPS receiver . either as map module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR R@@ ico@@ h Pro G3
the download of GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save these data in g@@ px format , since this is the only format to be supported by the module to Ge@@ ographic Pro@@ cedure .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data from pictures and from GPS extrac@@ ting and cor@@ related . on the following page you can see the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude , you can use this script that can be used with the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it is used for example of map@@ s.@@ google .

the settings of the lumin@@ ance from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; can be set on this page on the default values . anyway , some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; in the whole picture pack . if you have one , then you can obtain better impact results .
by default , the image processing has a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different colour , you can select that here . you can use the tool@@ bar switch off when you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposure areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker and bright color in the picture . these colors are fixed here . in the image processing , this sigh@@ t@@ ation can be used with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chrom@@ a sub@@ sampling is meant that the pictures are coded in higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the Far@@ bin@@ form@@ ations . please read this article by Wikipedia to this article .
with the setup of PNG files , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this surgery is not reduced the image quality , as PNG have a los@@ s@@ less algorith@@ m . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
using the TIFF files , you can convert the De@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compression algorith@@ m for TIFF images . this is reduced the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ates -@@ Alg@@ orith@@ m has worked out free .
with the setting los@@ s@@ free JPEG 2000 files you can choose any loss . even if you have written down the loss between quality loss and file size far better than to normal JPEG . when this unit was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the image processing is just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to create a tool for man@@ ip@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal in sensitive on ul@@ tra@@ violet light when the pixels are using this problem with minimal loss of details . this option dra@@ ws this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option dra@@ ws the picture a bit soft , but elim@@ inated the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ 3G or the AHD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is it a fixed colour balance sheet , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card which was photograph@@ ed on a white map .
this setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option will be ig@@ no@@ red .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your camera will be burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera to consider as through the in@@ ability of your camera . the setting is produced some unusual results , because they are trying to re@@ construc@@ t some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible , since blue pixels are not so fast as fast as green and red . &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; and dc@@ raw are the missing green and red @-@ shares of the still not saturated blue pixel . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option to re@@ construc@@ t your option , you get the possibility to set a level . this is a value of three com@@ promise and can therefore be adjusted for each image .
put the Lumin@@ esc@@ ence to your taste . you must probably be somewhat higher than the default 1 . this may also be done later in the image options of the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing . in order to get the time for the demo server , you should be careful !
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ ison -@@ Alg@@ orith@@ m is a digital image process to get a complete image from the section image sensor that presents many cameras , and which indicates a matrix color pixel . this algorith@@ m is known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour design .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; and thanks to some of these altern@@ atives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and AHD interface . after some tests there was created . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorith@@ m created by D@@ c@@ raw . however , it is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result .
if you know the de@@ viation of your l@@ ent@@ ils , you can set the red and blue coral value here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you have been carried out during the Roh@@ Converter .
an profile transl@@ ates the Far@@ bin@@ form@@ ations and gives instructions such as this again . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; information like the Far@@ bin@@ form@@ ations of a color space in the other are so exactly as possible .

self @-@ profile file S@@ itting here the folder , e.g. / usr / share / color / ICC / / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all your profiles . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; if it exam@@ ines the folder then during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles , you have the opportunity &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can change in open the raw file later .
the colour @-@ administ@@ ered view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or arg@@ yl@@ l . here , only your pictures are not man@@ ages the entire screen .
the input profiles should be custom@@ ized . not all profiles are made on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which contain any colour ton@@ m@@ apping or Gam@@ ma@@ correct correction . this means that you have to conduct the color m@@ apping itself .
there are further options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate it . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated , rather than to rely on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite ob@@ vious that colour profile for them is intended . unfortunately , it is not compatible with the models of Canon . therefore , here you can fit a table of cameras and profiles . this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion can recogn@@ ise the style : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Port and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in interface . it is a interface that supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; imag@@ ination and image processing is supported . many modules support which have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of the available modules . choose which you want to use &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; however , these modules will be released as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu .
brief inter@@ section for tasks , which are carried out by modules , can be set up in the menu below settings .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper shelf is adjusted between the images , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes on the met@@ ad@@ ata , or off , which ends at the lower end of the pictures during the display .
the camera properties show a list of all at the left . on the right side there is a button Automatic recognition , which is connected to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . you are to use the camera settings . currently , the port settings are currently serial , USB@@ - and USB / FireWire @-@ mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re- ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage camera . this field is only active when you have a USB@@ - or FireWire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera , or / m@@ nt /
to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you have to connect the camera to your computer , put it into the display mode and switch off .
try out of whether &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set the camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any of any designation for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option of actu@@ ation dialog for the shi@@ fting of &gt; pictures in the gar@@ bage burning , you can set the talk of a photos in an album . in the sn@@ ap of a photos and del@@ eting of a album you will find another details .
the edit@@ orial changes caused by the right side bar can be shut down welding using &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; if you want to use the option changes in the right side bar without any feedback . otherwise you need to use the changes with the button changes .
you can also contact the introduction of the welcome screens from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; while the start of the start . this acceler@@ ates the start from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
the setting up to new photos are looking for looking for new photos &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; the base time after new or deleted albums . this extends the start @-@ time from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . if something from the base plan was deleted , you will ask whether it should delete it out of the database .
various colour sch@@ em@@ as can be used in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings you can choose from the tool@@ bar design . a preview of available designs will be shown below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested , a new design for &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these view to see your photos and create a click with the left mouse button to the preview of a picture or by the Con@@ text menu of the preview and selection of view details / edit started .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; for example , they are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file number , enlar@@ gement factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the upper edge and ben@@ e@@ ath the tool bar to fast access to the most common functions .
the processing functions of image processing changes your photos . however , the features will change the original photo , before you can use the Save or the button Save out of the tool bar . NOTE that you can &apos;t restore the original photo , once you have the image saved .
so you should be ev@@ tl . copy a copy of your picture before you change it . it can carry out a file with the store .
as long as you have not stored the photo , you can use the original image , using the menu file , re@@ produce image processing in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change that you have conducted at the photo since the last store .
almost any promotion of image processing cannot be done or restored . the last action can be reset , re@@ loc@@ ally re@@ gre@@ ts or re@@ produced by using editing .
if you use this often , you should make the keyboard short@@ est , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ z to reset and Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re@@ produce .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB , on the re@@ plac@@ ard or restore button in the tool bar a moment longer , you will receive a Con@@ text menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are made between also back and restored .
once you move the image processing , you can move between the photos of the same album or the same key@@ word , you can use the navigation use in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture below or entries in the menu file . if you have any changes on the current photo , you are asked whether you want to back up this page .
you can see in the photo , and zo@@ oming in the Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the use menu .
in order to adjust the window size , you can use this knob in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor
view Full Screen Saver displays the picture in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the tool@@ bar code . if you don &apos;t want to see this in the settings dialog by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; change it from the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; main window will see the section to set the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the menu file , you can print the default and k@@ le ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or entire movements . all picture pages can select from your selection . you must select only the images with the default methods and select printing assistant . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice only .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; main window has a page bar at right edge , the important information and actions for the selected pictures are available , without the navigation file , also available in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five ri@@ ders is cli@@ cked :
multiple cli@@ cking on the same rider can be appe@@ aring back into the edge or dis@@ appear in the edge .
in the lab@@ elling view you can enter sign@@ ings with unlimited size . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the lab@@ elling will be cop@@ ied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data files are only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are removed after 2000 characters and are formed by other characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC let@@ tering field in other applications , you should note these restri@@ ctions .
after having comm@@ ented it , you can use either the button or switch to the next image , the lab@@ elling will then stored .
besides the application button there is a button . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata out of the selected file or the database . but this is always done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata adjustment which is always written into the pictures .
the evaluation review shows an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the page mode is always applied to the same image . to rate multiple pictures at the same time , select these from and use the Con@@ text menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field urg@@ ency . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word depic@@ ts a search box for the fil@@ tering of the words , the sample tree and a selection box with previously appeared in this &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; -@@ session end@@ owed j@@ acks .
the key@@ tree lo@@ om will be adjusted in accordance with the given search phr@@ ase . you can quickly use the number of possibilities in search for a key@@ word quickly , this ability is especially useful if you have many words .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief during the input of j@@ lit@@ ters in a picture series . if you have different words , these are stored for quick access .
key@@ words may also be set through mark@@ ings of the appropriate check boxes in tree . all keywords are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple pictures are selected in the main view and you can select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the entire selection , if you want to read a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the side panel j@@ ig@@ t@@ filter is used to change the selection of the main window frames with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and Se@@ arch@@ ies . if additionally , one or multiple sample filters out of the right side will only be displayed . all produced words are available .
you may also accept connections and place . supp@@ ose you have chosen several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can simply ask it out of the right side panel and put on a dialog if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a c@@ alender date . the key@@ word filter is chosen to no sample words . they were taken with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards it was taken a key@@ word from the right hand tree to the selection , and that this key@@ word should be given .
these search for changes takes place at any start of the program . you can also be switched on different versions .
if you have a rule with and created and establish it , it can be one or his own , you can easily change this easily with a double @-@ click on the text and control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which is wanted in the database . this is an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the Oper@@ ator , which is a name or a string , which is already written in the database .
for example , you can find a extended search about all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to match cho@@ ices , you need only check the check box at the end of the rule and then follow the button . the options then look like this :

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mostly adapted to &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why to create a color@@ ful work@@ flow , you can reach the colors from your camera or scanners , you can achieve that colours on your monitor or scanners , you can print the colors on your monitor or to print the colors on your monitor or on the web of your digital night@@ chamber .
if the topic is based on color administration , then you want to press what buttons needs to provide for the results of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide sufficient background information about colour management . in addition , links with a de@@ eper information allow you to make your own information decisions to make your desired outcome .
if your image work@@ flow performed all six below , then you need to take care of colour management .
they work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( more information see below )
your only other aspect ratio is by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if s@@ RGB is doing so well , and life for all so easy , why you should use another colour space so that thoughts about paint administ@@ ered ng ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB compared to the colors which we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional rep@@ orter of all colors which we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ical region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ently and click on information and then on information About RGB Working spaces .
do I have to fix my monitor , if I decided to work on my RGB color space only ?
Yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to monitor your monitor . if you &apos;re using your monitor , so you need to use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , you must use either your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve the picture in most cases . use it before you try to try a further manual processing .
the functions can norm@@ alize the same , automatic and contrast from the menu correc@@ ting automatic correction automatically out of your colors . they will need to experim@@ ent with these effects , to see what the best at your photo .
normal@@ izes : this method scal@@ able the light output values above the whole image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is so bright as possible without any colour sh@@ aded . this function is often an gast@@ ronom@@ ic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
the same method : this method is adjusted the ligh@@ ten@@ tion factor in the colors of selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channels are even so flat as possible . this means a very good results in the improvement of the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either mir@@ acle with a picture or it destroyed it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . the dark and bright border sh@@ ades and adjusted the red , green and blue channels in the entire hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improved the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of RGB values of a picture by the post@@ p@@ est and highest levels of all values . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to complete the white balance of a photos .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted to an colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can occur too far from the original image , if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which can operate in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorith@@ m of ur@@ rec@@ tly leg@@ ally protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start on the menu entry colors white balance of the image processing .
the window can be adapted to the size . on the left side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target box . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the lower window .
the preview of the target company has a red mark@@ ers . the lumin@@ ance of the pi@@ anist with this mark@@ ers is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above is a hist@@ ogram , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small Lumin@@ esc@@ ence . with one button you decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be called .
the contrast of your result was hang@@ ed by shadow , satur@@ ation and Gamma . the shadow of justice will improve your favorite details or down also down .
att@@ ach to the above controls , you should use the colour temperature pipette . push on this button and then somewhere on the image preview for calcul@@ ating the colour temperature to the white balance . this type will also be automatically set to the temperature and green values .
additionally , you can set the white balance with the list of the default settings . the following settings are available :
the co@@ at@@ lo@@ co@@ ator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the Pi@@ o- trans@@ formers .. you will get the combined result in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure Indi@@ c@@ ator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and store do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you can store it into a text file and later again .
the knob pres@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and corresponding neutral white balance . NOTE that even neutral settings will see another picture as your original . if you save this store your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding control per colour channel of the processed image format . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited to high quality images . however , this coding requires even more disk space , comp@@ uting time and stands for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of tubes . it uses the change and assignment of color profile . colour ton@@ m@@ apping can be performed by the window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for use of paint profiles , you can move the chapter colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu below colors pick@@ up . this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same correction . in the manual for audio @-@ correction you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for grad@@ ation that you will find in the menu on the menu .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; Tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ections provides you four colour effects , a solar energy effect , an Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and a Can@@ oe filter .
in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the image has been developed , and then the development of the image has been inver@@ ted . the result was a partially negative inside of image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
intensity controls the solar control . at about 50 % intensity shows the image which is electro@@ less possible . an additional increase creates a negative image that is not usable on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the standardi@@ zation ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Effect . he diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation effect , it is brilliant , brilliant . try it easy to make a lot of photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name to be created by the Japanese company Fuj@@ if@@ ilm . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ire ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly have a choice for natural photo@@ graph@@ s . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly which are also some Photo@@ graph@@ ers , especially to whom the sc@@ arc@@ ely scen@@ eries are too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast of the contrast . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the neo @-@ light . at large pictures , the filter can add the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual that you want to experim@@ ent the colour tap@@ ing and the lamp in the menu below colours . all your justice will be satisfied with the result . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you have a photo in bad light conditions , you can get a good choice for brightness / satur@@ ation of satur@@ ation . all changes you can perform in the preview . if it &apos;s the result you can confirm the changes with o@@ k .
between the complex tool Grad@@ ation and the simple Leu@@ k@@ strength / Contr@@ ast / Gamma is the tool sound correction for impro@@ ving the exposure . even if the dialog appears to this tool very comp@@ lic@@ ated , you will need for the range of shooting purposes only the range of sli@@ der . concrete the three shooting below the hist@@ ogram .
the window includes an application of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , of active can@@ als or the selected area . under the graphic , three shooting in the picture are exposed to change the intensity values . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the eas@@ iest way to learn the operation is to move to the control , and change it to the image as the image changes .
on the right side , the original and the preview of the picture will be viewed . the preview is dynamic , updated from the picture of the picture . on the left hand , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this evaluation box can be displayed if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mix Y @-@ axis is often used . for pictures of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic initi@@ ation is useful .
three regulator : the top of the dark sounds , the middle of the bright sounds , the middle of the sh@@ ades , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three colors pet@@ ed can be used in the preview of the original image , to adjust the input values of the sh@@ adows , medium and bright sounds . moreover , there is a knob for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values can be used to change the selection values for each area . there are also two controllers can be used to change the output values such as the input values can be used as a background for something else in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically exp@@ andable depending on the intensity values .
save as and store : with this buttons , set the set values in the file system and re@@ loaded later again . in addition to this , the Gim@@ p levels is used .
if you are using these mode and the three color pip@@ et , the input values automatically adjusted for all shade , medium and sol@@ arium will be re @-@ adjusted , and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram , green , blue and the lumin@@ esc@@ ens .
the option transfer inde@@ xed indicators will display all colour channels to display over@@ loaded pixels , and this combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect on the preview only and there is no effect at the final result .
below , you can see an example of the align@@ ment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha canal , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the origin@@ als and the target image is indicated . the preview can be viewed in dependence by your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fied channel : these evaluation box allows the channel to specify the channel from the module :
in addition to this box , two ic@@ ons are to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mix view . most of the linear mode of a constant color , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a cur@@ ator after right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds can be correspon@@ dent and correspon@@ d to the associated image pixel dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marked on the curve . if you want to change this mark on the curve , you will create a right line on this line and move the value on this line and move the value to your taste , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and store : with this buttons , you can do exactly this . every turn you can replace with this file system and later , the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you set this method and the three color pip@@ et buttons , the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sol@@ arium . activ@@ ate the color , you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option transfer Indi@@ c@@ ator will display all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than a channel over@@ loaded pixels , you will receive the combined result . this is a preview only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white picture which has been correc@@ ted in the lumin@@ ary . Sh@@ adows and sol@@ arium was set with the col@@ li@@ ons and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing is a tool to enh@@ ance the color channels or to change the sh@@ aded photos of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can process it from the menu @-@ channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can see the relative distribution and calculation . the left area of the window shows you a preview of the window . the original can be viewed to compare over the own rider .
the preview of the target range has a red mark@@ ers . if you set this in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to display the respective user value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allows you to activ@@ ate this channels when you enable the corresponding paint component . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the option of great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white port@@ raits .
sometimes , especially when you choose Monochrome , reducing the reduction of a color to a visible space that comes from the same place in color channel and whose space is different from any channel . if the case is , you can improve your Monochrome converting to improve the far@@ ming .
the store as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any popular mixer setting can store you for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option transfer inde@@ xed indicators will display all colour channels to display over@@ loaded pixels , and this combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect on the preview only and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted . this option is activated . the original image is activated ( 1 ) and this image has been shown below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your Abst@@ rac@@ tion . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , as color pictures can easily be converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film transfer with a green left filter . this looks good for port@@ raits against the sky . thus , like the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ver@@ ter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film photography with an orange lens filters . this impro@@ ves landscapes , marit@@ ime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ filmed .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film transfer with a red lens filters . this creates dram@@ atic vision @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate Mond@@ li@@ cea to daylight . thus similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film transfer with a yellow lens filters . this is the most natural color correction and impro@@ ves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : this creates hot bright and medium tones while he adds a bit cold in the sad@@ dles of a pressure and recovery in a sep@@ tic acid . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ ia .
using &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool tex@@ ture , you can contact decorative tex@@ tures on an image .
through the adding a tex@@ ture to your picture , ir@@ respective whether it is a colour image or not , you can look like a oil painting on a wall@@ paper , a pop style portrait of enlar@@ ging points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry picture tex@@ ture can be used for the image processing .
relief : floating this parameter to the right increases the level of depth and three dimensional tex@@ ture of tex@@ ture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ tured is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed to ( 2 ) . the parameters of relief is set to 200 .
adding a decorative frame can be added with the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool bar can be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is no easy task . to keep his attention to keep the image of a decorative frame . this is a psych@@ ological barrier to the stre@@ aming eye . adding the module from the image processing .
type : with this parameter set the desired type of box for your picture . through an dil@@ ute line and wide range ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , the ideal frame is ideal for a button extension and decor@@ atively added a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specif@@ ies the width of the frame in percent . the value range is limited by 1 % to 50 % .
that with the frame @-@ decorated target image is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially when you have used the tool to add the aspect ratio before .
with this practical tool , you can easily add a @-@ format text into a picture of any spot . this is also on several locations if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply use the text and place it with the mouse . use text , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set of the picture size . for the end , you can simply choose a frame around the text and / or a half transparent background . the picture is finished .
any setting , which you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you have entered the button &quot; OK . after the image once was saved , the text is part of the image . he cannot be changed anymore .
with the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool st@@ encil , you can place a st@@ encil about an image .
the menu image st@@ encil to be used in the image processing , to place an image on a picture .
for the st@@ encil , there is no restri@@ ctions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to add the PNG file format and should you want to add a e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; mail@@ ing@@ list dig@@ ik@@ am @-@ Us@@ ers @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you are using this tool for the first time you need to put your st@@ encil file with the button base files in the dialog . select the file into the st@@ encil files . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root ord@@ ner set out for the tem@@ plates which refle@@ cts the Ord@@ n@@ erst@@ ation of the st@@ encil manager . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
under the preview you are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ged the following picture . it is cent@@ red around the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
cr@@ ises : this knob resi@@ zed down below . it will be cent@@ ered to the position of the mouse . if you want to use the mouse on the whole image , you have to ver@@ ify the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this button to move below the template below . take the picture and put it to the desired position .
use OK if you want to address the st@@ encil to your image . the picture is then adapted to the template size .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; presents three different tools to sharp@@ ens . each of you have pre@@ ferences in other areas .
sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it &apos;s very fast and simple , but generates especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
un@@ sharpen@@ ed mask works on the contrast of the edges . actually , it is not a bit really psych@@ ov@@ is@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric Dun@@ es and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gim@@ p and is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three , because he really improve the sharp@@ ness . it is a little comp@@ lic@@ ated in its use and has various parameters to adap@@ t .
photos without focus and most digit@@ alised pictures need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is the same phenom@@ enon to be applied to a common color . this is the same phenom@@ enon to be printed when colour points are printed on paper . SLR cameras need more than normal levels as normal cameras for privacy .
at JPEG images a camera is widely applied in internal sharp@@ ening . pictures in the raw format , we must always have to be used throughout processing .
some scanner apply a sharp@@ ness filter already during the picture of the picture . when you activ@@ ate this de@@ activ@@ ate , check control over your image .
in some situations you can obtain necessary results by using a photo using sharp@@ ening material removal . you can call with the menu entry .
they should be careful when the results are not very natural look : sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but increasingly also the noise . in general , you will reach it over the menu entry . you will reach more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ens .
sometimes you have the opposite results : a picture is a bit soft . the solution to draw a bit soft . use the tool to the sof@@ ten@@ er and experim@@ ent with the menu entry and experim@@ enting something with the settings . the advance on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter de@@ compos@@ ite is a very good tool to remove grinding of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help the image . the fil@@ ament shows the issue of the screen with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results and should increase the effect . if you make the skin mask too strongly , smoking and the impression of gre@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius represents a lot of pixel screen on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ os . you should therefore sharp@@ ens pictures at the best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the respect image which is added to the original . this will set the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the threshold value is a fr@@ action of the maximum RGB values and to apply difference . it can therefore be defined for a lower difference between the pots of sharp@@ ness , except therefore Schön@@ ness error in fac@@ ial , Himm@@ ler and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this image has been used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ am ; tool re@@ foc@@ uses on impro@@ ves a picture through impro@@ ving the sharp@@ ness . it used to ass@@ ess@@ ly protected the copyright fil@@ let filters -@@ Alg@@ orith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to navig@@ ate a picture to &amp; quot ; in which it &apos;s a better approach to sharp@@ ens . this is using a tool named FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the use of a sharp mask . re@@ focus will usually reach better results as un@@ sharp . you can start colors from the menu by using colors re@@ focus on the image processing .
in practice , the circular saw is much better than the pal@@ let &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche folding has a very long tail , depending on the source code , which is far away from the original cross and so far , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; is influ@@ enced in most cases , even very strongly influ@@ enced by the dist@@ ant pixels . the un@@ wanted results are caused un@@ wanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameters for the use of this module . it is the most important parameters for the use of this module . you can set a higher value if your picture is very un@@ sharp , but then you should pay attention to sanctuary .
cor@@ relation : enh@@ ancing cor@@ relation can help reduce ar@@ isation . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values are close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation is reduced to the visual effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of noise filter can help you reduce ar@@ effici@@ ents . however , values above 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter can be too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.03 . a high value is even more contam@@ ination .
Gau@@ ß &apos; sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos; s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ ci@@ ous filter is caused . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 , so you might need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determin@@ es the size of trans@@ form@@ at@@ rix . if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; . however , the module is very slowly when you choose large values for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value of 3 @-@ 10 .
the store as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any popular reproduction parameters will be stored for later and can be loaded later .
try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before use the module .
otherwise you should use the module , before you change the image on the other hand . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately , but later they leave un@@ pleasant art@@ e@@ facts .
if you can read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
General Produc@@ es un@@ sch@@ emes m@@ asked better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be caused by reason a greater neighborhood use as sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ ti@@ cally it must always produce ar@@ cer@@ pts . even under optimal conditions it can never make the effect of the un@@ parall@@ eled filter . practi@@ cally it is the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least the same as the un@@ parall@@ eled mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better for processing of small details .
at the bottom , you can watch a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be correc@@ ted . this image has been made with an analog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for further information on the methods of the respon@@ ses in digital bil@@ ites you can read technical data in English under this address .
the regulator Gl@@ ory is set out the sharp edge of the surface , to generate a natural p@@ up@@ lighter .
the colour ink allows a adapted color to the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts .
the algorith@@ m was developed by the IMAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool provides several counts as Star@@ points to simp@@ lif@@ y the restoration . the available settings are shown below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
details p@@ onder@@ ing &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preserv@@ ation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass . a value of 0.9 should be details so that no sharp@@ ness is required . please note that the details should always be subject to the guid@@ ing dependent .
basic effic@@ acy of alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smo@@ oth@@ ed in all directions , while a value is very similar to 1 in one direction . if you have a film paper or CCD noise , a very high value of similar pattern generate . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ e@@ te will be elim@@ inated at a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this set the maximum smo@@ othing factor via all@@ es@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regular control signal : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher of this value is necessary , the more will be smo@@ oth@@ ed when it &apos;s hard to estimate the geomet@@ ry of image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ance effect , he must be higher than 3 .
rep@@ et@@ itions : specif@@ ies how often the algorith@@ m run through . usually this is 1 or 2 .
angle grad@@ as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is selected , it should also be chosen . NOTE that small angles should generate a long run@@ time . you should make this value as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integration width increments &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ able stri@@ de width in pixels . you should avoid small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never be larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the quality will use the quality which you will receive by sel@@ ecting this option is only small . but it doubled the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him to allow it .
the buttons are mir@@ rors and load this . every setting of image errors can be stored here in a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
image errors can be compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob break@@ through .
below you can see as picture error with small art@@ e@@ facts . the module is applied to a photo that is created in Guatemala City with an an@@ alo@@ t camera in the fore@@ ground that caused by a poor film during the journey to see and the original image is under ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ am ; rough@@ beam is a very powerful tool to reduce Bil@@ dr@@ au@@ schen . it uses an ur@@ isp@@ ens@@ able algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selected educational filter to remove spots and other art@@ e@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair in the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ ac@@ ute ; -@@ effects from imported images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this tut@@ orial in this tut@@ orial in this tut@@ orial .
the screen photo shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you will need only the window details and the window @-@ window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , of 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can be used through the radius of the range through the image and the color in it is smo@@ oth@@ ed and with the smaller errors .
focus : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value requires the pixel pitch of the filters according to the front . if the value is too high , if you need to change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can &apos;t get more and noise and sm@@ ell again .
Kan@@ ten : controls the edge accuracy of the filter . if it is too strongly , the frequency response can be removed or smo@@ other points . set him on a value near the Maxim@@ us if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ e@@ facts .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ escent sample of the picture . we recommend you either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve your image . these settings are not subject to the smo@@ othing process by the details settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of picture . we recommend you either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve your image . these settings are not subject to the smo@@ othing process by the details settings .
gamma : controls the gamma value of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas which are typically stronger . it does not poll@@ uted the atten@@ ds .
d@@ amping : controls the align@@ ment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing . this value defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius at variations of the lumin@@ ance if it is too high , can occur if it can occur at his minimum , smoking and ph@@ az@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur at edges . it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for this .
save and store : these buttons are using exactly this . all parameters used for noise , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later on .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with the default settings .
sometimes a picture of a cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . to draw a bit more simple than a picture . use tool to sof@@ tly and experim@@ ent with the menu entry and experim@@ enting with the glass . the advance on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools developed by photo@@ graphic file .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted art@@ e@@ facts from your pictures . it is very good adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos; sch@@ es , film paper , cr@@ at@@ zer , compression art@@ is@@ ies , and later digit@@ alised digit@@ alised images . the smo@@ othing takes place along the image con@@ tours and gets the content as it makes the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and text for@@ cement , the text message is carried out with another tool , the aspect ratio was developed by the IMAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should be correct .
the buttons are mir@@ rors and load this . every setting of photo @-@ restoration may be stored here in a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can reduce as a photo with equ@@ ili@@ ent noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ ori@@ ous film pieces on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time , Tex@@ tures can be read on an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the Scan Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te from the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ia paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ am ; tool Hot@@ pixel are allowed to remove hot pixels from photos using a CCD camera , eight were using Alg@@ orith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression comes on a built @-@ in subst@@ itute for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark sub@@ trac@@ tion method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
Download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will recogn@@ ise automatic hot and bright pixels . these are high@@ ligh@@ ted in the image show .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to record the dark image directly to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the correct picture . please note that the assistant to be the last dark image , and this will automatically return to the next meeting .
the image area and the preview can help you in the image the result . the case shows the issue of the film with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all sizes .
choose an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the Fil@@ ters . then choose the best filter to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
thir@@ ds : it will be an average of the neighbor@@ ho@@ ist pixel . it is assigned to all def@@ ects in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels at a distance of 1 from the pixel block , are pul@@ led to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Linear Cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel inside block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block will be reduced to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pul@@ led to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel inside block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and longer exposure , applied . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; Vign@@ es@@ tier@@ ing Cor@@ rection is a tool to be correc@@ ted , i.e. , te@@ alight corners , one image .
wide angle lens , especially the middle and large photo format , can be often exposed to the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of image by remov@@ ing the light to the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ Obj@@ ectives have also shown this behavior .
but it also does draw@@ back@@ s . many Center filter need a factor of 1.5 or 2 while sh@@ utter filters , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be able to use with Center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ profit@@ able effects will arise .
with the large coating areas of today &apos;s Fil@@ men@@ tions and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by an aci@@ dic transformation of a raw material that is made without these filters . the scope of use with a Center@@ filter is being protected against an image . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vign@@ et@@ ting Cor@@ rection Filter and with three further the exposure of the target body .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light effect at the point of the largest density of filters . the standard density is 2,0 , resulting in a optical filter with an aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly an optical strength of 2 , kid@@ neys , reduce the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vign@@ es@@ entation , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degrees .
leu@@ k@@ ness , Contr@@ ast and Gamma settings : the processing of a picture with the Vign@@ et@@ isation layer reduces the LEDs of pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target data with these options , because you have to increase the settings only .
if you want to use a host@@ ile of exposure to the target of target , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma on zero and use the grad@@ ation from the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing from the menu .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the desired picture in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ ted picture . a lamp diff@@ use and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ ics ; lin@@ king @-@ dist@@ or@@ tion is a tool to correc@@ ted the effect of spher@@ ical l@@ ent@@ ils on photos . it uses an ur@@ isp@@ ens@@ able algorith@@ m by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric or@@ tion . colour dist@@ or@@ tion can &apos;t be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the second degree is treated with the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion of lens and can conc@@ ave the conc@@ ave or conv@@ ex shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third gr@@ ades has a similar way @-@ effects , but fl@@ atten@@ ed into the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth gr@@ ades correc@@ ts the dist@@ ant corners opposite the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric or@@ tion can be elim@@ inated almost elim@@ inated .
General : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion second Gr@@ ades . with negative values , t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical orn@@ ings can be correc@@ ted and positive values of k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic dist@@ or@@ tion .
corner : this value controlled the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion fourth gr@@ ades . this value increases stronger than the edges than in the center of picture . for most l@@ ent@@ ils the &apos; corners parameters of the parameter of the parameter is generally used .
Zoom : this value scale the picture shows the image size and leads to an Cor@@ rection first size . negative values are en@@ large while positive the picture .
up@@ heav@@ al : this value adjusted the brightness into the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values it increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated by the dialogue with a preview of the dist@@ or@@ tion Cor@@ rection . the values you are using for your image , stored in the next start as default values .
t@@ onn@@ es@@ - or k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic correction should be carried out prior to all add@@ itives or size changes . best you have to cut this correction as all first . if you have a picture to cut and after that a t@@ onn@@ al correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ se .
to help you find the best correction to show you this tool for vertical and a horizontal relief line . move the mouse po@@ inter to fix the lines on this site , and press the left mouse button around the lines at this point . in the connection you can correct t@@ onn@@ es@@ - / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic dist@@ or@@ tion with the help of lines .
if you correc@@ ted a k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic dist@@ or@@ tion , the resulting image has black corners . you can remove these dialog boxes using the image processing or via Zoom Reg@@ ulator this dialog .
for most pictures , the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction from the front , frame and paintings are the perspective such as frame , frame and paintings . notice that if you keep the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ or@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website , which produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this UR@@ L . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters , film paper and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to adjust film paper and film sensitivity . the ISO regulator is changed the amount of film pieces and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ oph@@ yl@@ l in nature ) in the conversion . green me@@ adows are white as snow !
since the filters can be mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make any sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the Far@@ bin@@ form@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ let on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and this worked image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type A@@ ura in the top lights .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter film gritt is an easy to use film screen@@ shots like e.g. B / W Ko@@ dak Tri @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films to increase the manufacturer large silver gra@@ ins of the photo@@ emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ iny impact gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . if you want to see this special , gallery arti@@ gen , rhin@@ estones , gra@@ iny view especially to your mon@@ och@@ rom@@ ms photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control of the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the bas@@ k@@ age . the default value is , although often higher values are required to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film gra@@ iny impact on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil paintings . it uses an ur@@ isp@@ ens@@ able algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ am ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil paintings . nature photos and styles are good for these effect .
there are two shelves to influence these effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five out . thick@@ er brush is better for large pictures . smooth , the glucose or , from the other side is considered to be hin@@ der .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and this is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Gl@@ ory 17 .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon dioxide . this is not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen you to catch him .
there are two shelves with a value range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regulator sel@@ ects the sticks size and the lower is adjusted to the contrast ( smo@@ kes ) .
this is an example of the coal direc@@ tories . the original image ( 1 ) and the amended picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved due to adap@@ ting the intensity .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter engraving the picture in 3 @-@ D , when it was marked in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works especially the most important content in pictures . the filter uses differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ling landscape .
depth allows to set the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , the default setting is set .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the image used image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an art@@ work with dist@@ or@@ tion effects . it uses ur@@ rec@@ tly protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
oil blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image in the cells and makes it look like if it appears through glass blocks .
Wave blocks 2 : analogue to the wav@@ y blocks 1 is dist@@ orted the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can canc@@ el these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an art@@ work with accid@@ ent@@ ity effects . it uses ur@@ rec@@ tly protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom Fol@@ lowing : compar@@ ing the picture along a glob@@ ular lines that go out of a center . this sim@@ ulates the imp@@ lications a zo@@ om@@ ed camera , thus produces a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ ale notes : linked the image by turning the pixel to a center . this sim@@ ulates the imp@@ lications of a turning camera .
distance prob@@ ation : do the image to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera system . the object seems back to the background .
movement of movement : linked the picture by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the imp@@ lies of a bit moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
wheat gra@@ ins : wi@@ ped the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this is ideal for creating the romantic port@@ raits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and sub@@ tle hot .
Schütt@@ el@@ sharpen@@ ed : linked the picture through random translation of pixel and sim@@ ulates the imp@@ lications of an ar@@ bit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
Intelligent Spec@@ if@@ ers : finds the Far@@ ms in the image and know this without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and created it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice small tool to make Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps on your image . this makes it possible to make your pictures a n@@ great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ ber@@ ally protected algorith@@ m .
tropical size allowed it to change the size of the dri@@ p size . since the dri@@ p size does not need to decrease the size for small pictures . number of drops and density of drops . fish changes to the optical effect of drop in the picture .
you can keep using &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . use the selection tool to select the range , e.g. a face that will be freely re@@ commen@@ ce . if you re@@ boot the filter , the range is free from ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps .
this is an example of the knob Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the picture is the wrong orientation , you can bring it by sp@@ elling or turning into the right orientation . tools are located in the trans@@ forming or trans@@ forming sp@@ elling .
photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to en@@ large one photo in a minimum loss of image quality .
a painting is simple . the big question is , how you can find a painting and how you can find a picture ? how can you find a lack of information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorith@@ m is used here , makes it a good job . try him and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose the dimensions change in menu and enter the target values . dialog is visible below .
the tool to change the size is used a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to en@@ rolling the pixels . if you want a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split Inter@@ pol@@ ation to en@@ large picture . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; using a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorith@@ m was developed by the IMAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image is ret@@ ained .
regular control signal : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher of this value is necessary , the more will be smo@@ oth@@ ed , because it &apos;s difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ance effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and store are being used exactly . every single conversion for photo can be stored as text file and later re@@ loaded later .
photo inflatable is very fast at what it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load . you can break the calculation any@@ time with the button .
you can see below a example for photo blow by using a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlar@@ ged picture ( 3 ) is the result of the linear enlar@@ gement for comparison .
the cutting of a photos is not only one frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently estimated tools do not need to create a picture with the mouse , just push the mouse button and tigh@@ tening the rectangle with the mouse . you will see this sp@@ ell then see the mouse while keeping the mouse .
when you leave the mouse , the field of photos will be cut off . thus , you will receive a good overview like your photo after the cutting edges . you can create the size of the right @-@ to @-@ cutting edges . a new rectangle you can go easily with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the cut @-@ cut button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is tri@@ mm@@ ed ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Entries to store or file Save file to store the newly designed picture .
in the fore@@ front area you can change the size of the rectangle with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you defined in the dialog , remains in the dialog .
in the tool to an aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or horizontal format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the horizontal format is assigned .
the tool to add a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you use cm , inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to be automatic horizontal or vertical .
below the dialog can be set down in the dialog with the maximum ratio to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool To add the aspect ratio saves the next time , depending on the image orientation ( Horizontal or Vertical ) . if you are stored as default values in terms of orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will be played and not the original image .
the settings of the comp@@ ilation support enables help to set up your images , so that you have to set your images better :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ ar@@ ity . like the Dr@@ itt@@ el@@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ious triangles is a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
gold middle : the golden center is a division that foc@@ uses on different natural growth , such as the Spir@@ al of Nautilus Mus@@ cle or the Bl@@ ades of a Sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things which we find as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 988 ... and it was used to make your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you used your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is po@@ inting out of the Fibonacci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number after 1 is the golden center . the standing research is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered the visual harmon@@ ious .
the golden center represents a liquid aid lines if you set a picture in the middle of the surface . these sigh@@ tings are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring your goal good results for your photos to achieve the golden spiral line through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the multi @-@ axis along the line of spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river .
another rule is the right corner of gold spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye is turned into the center of the composition . this thing can be one line or different objects . this thing can just be done without the eye , it will ful@@ fill his task .
the Golden triangles is also taken from the top of gold spiral . their failure are the middle of the sides of the golden se@@ pul@@ sion . NOTE that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not equally tiny triangles . diagonal to these lines can be an static object .
if you use golden triangles using your frames , you create a effect of the professional photograph@@ ers dynamic sym@@ metry . try your picture focus on one of the sec@@ uting and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach any other information .
the options horizontal split and vertical nails can be used to refle@@ ct the harmon@@ ious particles .
with the button color you can set the color of auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colours and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this type , you can adjust the colour of the lines of your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle .
if you make a picture , then it happens to keep the camera not exactly verti@@ cally or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where the things are turned towards an angle . you can select that with the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . choose the free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degree . with the button default you can set the shooting again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of image will be shown above .
at your help , the module is free a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image show around the two lines you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjusted the angle as described in the previous section .
once you have turned an image in the corners , you will find un@@ wanted holes in the corners . one way to repair it is the function of transformation from the image processing .
a nice way to cut the picture is the function of automatic add@@ itives . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ ases smo@@ oth@@ ed the picture a bit after turning . notice the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ities are performed to a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the center of picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you can help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new picture , including the empty areas which have been created through the transformation .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas which were created by the transformation .
at the top : shows the current angle in degree at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
at the top : shows the current angle in degree at the top right corner of the transformed area .
at the bottom right : shows the current angle in degree at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
at the bottom right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after the adjustment of perspective the picture will be a bit dir@@ ty . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjust@@ ments generate a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have changed the perspective , you will get un@@ pleas@@ ing tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one possibility of this is the picture with trans@@ form decoration from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . with other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module with trans@@ forming sc@@ iss@@ ors .
sc@@ iss@@ ing your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you can press the default , the angles can be reset to zero . a preview of the Eff@@ ective will display you and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed right from the board field .
to help you get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to a key point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines you can now adjust the switch tool to adjust your picture .
after which you have carried out the picture , the picture is a bit conf@@ id@@ ent . for a single damage , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble , but two s@@ ings generated twice as much , so you should avoid this .
after the failure , the picture has a nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to elim@@ inate this is the picture with trans@@ form decoration designs from the image processing .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; requires a number of libr@@ aries and other packages to read image formats , therefore have been compiled by your system and , in some cases , by the type such as this libr@@ aries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions are using &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am .
due to other libr@@ aries , it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; shows only files in formats from images . if the extension in the list is listed , &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the file extensions is listed in the image processing . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; click on the section configuration .
virtually all digital cameras store photographs in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to use the format . a detailed description of these file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports both formats .
picture compression is the application of data compression method to digital pictures . in addition , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw aspect ratio , you can read by Wikipedia , The Lumin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour and helpful . you can find raw format images in JPEG or TIFF . you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; supports the load of raw images only with the program dc@@ raw , which can be found in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; they can see below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw files that are supported by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
many digital cameras supporting short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . if you see any built @-@ in possibilities for the movies . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . if you click on a film file &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you can use movies to play movies to play program .

if you get the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can carry the first four ju@@ di@@ ments with the white balance .
many tools you need the photo@@ graphic design are contained in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , plast@@ ering , smo@@ oth@@ s , ir@@ cul@@ um , ir@@ reversible , and etc ; . use a single dialog box before the filter is applied to the current image . below see &amp; quot ; text@@ ur an@@ dest@@ en@@ quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . links from him allow five buttons to the compar@@ ative mode of the previous mode . these modes are :
verti@@ cally parts without Dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected Pre@@ ferences area .
horizontal share without Dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected action area .
verti@@ cally parts . the left area depic@@ ts the original and right to the effect of the film .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and lower at the effect of the fil@@ ter .
&apos;@@ mouse via &apos; style : shows the preview if mouse is not in the action area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons on the use to show over@@ - and under@@ taking exposure . the colours can be adapted to the general unic@@ ode side .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse in the picture and on the part of the picture which you want to see you . the preview in the left part of the dialog appears immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset the buttons on your default values . all adjustment from the last use of the module are marked .
the page strip features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self ex@@ plan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters at the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive user tool based on the Marble mini@@ ature program . you can move up with the mouse wheel . press Ctr@@ l ; lin@@ ker &apos;s mouse button to move up . all pictures within this coordinates must be filtered and displayed . this is of course ahead of your paintings Geo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ colo@@ rec@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . application can be used for use of colour pal@@ let and to select colors and use of colors .
the pall@@ ets files , installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined colour and used color used color .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pal@@ let , select the file to files .
c@@ ursor is shown in the pal@@ let view as line . it can be moved , by cli@@ cking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside the colour . the colour is described under the pal@@ let view . here the color name can be changed .
it can also be used too . to move a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor way . then move the mouse at pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is added to the button color , the color is added to the c@@ ursor down . the color will be inserted either , or writes another ; depending on whether the mode can be selected . these mode you can adjust the check box below the C@@ ursor in both mode .
a selection , which was created in the last section , can be used together with the actions cop@@ ying , cutting and insert .
&amp; k@@ colo@@ rec@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the barbell rack : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue , and a optional colour name , followed by a further color . if you are three numer@@ able values in the meantime , you can be inserted as a paint in &amp; k@@ colo@@ rec@@ dit .
the colours in the pal@@ let and the color choice can be drawn with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find in the ink on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graphic programs are used . so far , there was no modern &amp; GU@@ I ; programs to visu@@ alize graphics ; programs , and graph@@ ical ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ project has set itself the goal to replace these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graph@@ ical surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ le ; programme .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ers ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; slow ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GU@@ I ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; calcul@@ ates the graphics and to@@ graph viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graphics in &amp; Kate ; to open graphic and graphic viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component is open
loading by large graphics ( currently there are problems over 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ le ; program that requires the &amp; graph@@ ical ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for display of the graphics cards . need to be used in detail :
the main window shows the open graphic , each in a own lower window . at the beginning , if you start &amp; cold viewer , the main window is empty as the symbol file , and the ( empty ) list Last modified files . click on the first symbol to display the dialog file .
after you have chosen one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , a look at the corner is displayed if the graph is bigger than the character size . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select that position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and without special fast@@ ing , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ om@@ es is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below , you can see the maximum adjustment of a graphic .
if the straight vie@@ wers in &amp; graphic viewer ; charged file has been changed from another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ign@@ ore the change , so that the decision to be ig@@ no@@ red . if you want to change your decision later , you can also use the menu item as a graph @-@ viewer , see also .
if you can open a Graph@@ ite outside of a running &amp; graphic viewer ; Inst@@ ance , &amp; eg ; in file browser or at the command line , you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; Inst@@ ance you want or to inv@@ iting graphics in a window of the ongoing instance .
as with the last option you can store your choice , but do this also change with the align@@ ment dialog .
in the program boot , you can open all the graphic presentation of your final session . again , you can record your choice both and change later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split into multiple sides . the horizontal and vertical pages can be selected .
if you are using several sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s are to be set on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the page may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several sides distributed graphics without head line and with another font
the site again provides the possibility to define the behaviour if a file is changed , and eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re @-@ upload or the program can be ig@@ no@@ red ) or the program every time .
the page open the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; cold viewer . if a graph is open outside of the current session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( the graph in a new window , or in a window of the current session ) or determine that each time is being asked .
the site meetings are the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; cold viewer . you can specify a standard behavior ( the files in the last session or not ) or determine if you want to be asked .
the Con@@ text menu , which usually appears in a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; further features :
here you can choose among various vi@@ vi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorith@@ ms select . the entries , as they are described on the web site of &amp; graph@@ ical ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Alg@@ orith@@ m , the standard for the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ent graph@@ s . the Alg@@ orith@@ m puts the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom , or left to the right ) and then trying to produce a short edges and as possible .

the printing assistant allows several pictures on a sheet paper together . the combined pictures can be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : sen@@ sible to improve you or with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your digital format stored in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command lines of the command of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Ih@@ m@@ ist : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera eller . sometimes you get the dc@@ raw results ! .
first , select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can look at the effect of your current settings .
you can now turn the values to optimi@@ ze the values , whether the camera settings can be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplif@@ iers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to process the picture later .
a four @-@ colour RG@@ BG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the RG@@ BG Switch has no effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview you can select one of the three output formats and the file name remains similar , and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG has been used one loss of algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all information of your picture and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ ZW Com@@ pression .
if you have frequently asked their images often or later on the other hand , you should not use the JPEG format , as it is only a limited number of operations allows you to keep the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
in case you can choose JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted to your settings , you can start button to start button . if you want to break this process , you can break off this process .
the st@@ acker processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to one time . use this mode only if you are safe , e.g. through testing on a single image that are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , this is helpful if this was produced in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the advanced bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the convert from the Im@@ age@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ ame of all images of a album . you can set pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amps can be used .
this module can be used to change the size of several pictures of a picture collection . it uses the Convert program from the Im@@ age@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can use the image to be smaller or en@@ large . in addition , four types of images are provided :
propor@@ tional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of picture is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : dimensions change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adap@@ t your image to the screen format .
not propor@@ tional : not propor@@ tional magn@@ itude in two dimensions . the aspect ratio will be changed in this option .
preparation : prepare the picture for photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and size of phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , includes background size , Rand@@ om size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images in advance . other pictures can draw on the list of sending paintings and put there .
after you started the module , the images will be displayed with you selected pictures . via the button , you can add another pictures to you using a file selection dialog . for the last picture , a preview of the right image will be displayed on the right side .
you can also draw pictures to the picture list and add it to the list of send@@ est images .
using the button pictures , the selected pictures are removed from the list of send@@ mail images .
after you selected all pictures you can open the new message with the button . open your e @-@ mail clients . you need to add here the addresses and the subject . you need to add pictures from you selected pictures already as an@@ nex .
look not to send a lot of pictures on once . most E @-@ mail accounts have limit@@ ations for the size of sending e @-@ ma@@ ils . it might be a good idea to send multiple em@@ ails when you want to send many images .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for the images of the images . their configuration will be stored and will change it again until you change them .
choose your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the election of comments in a modified file the comments are inserted into a text file and included the mail .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality will not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original em@@ if@@ ers will be added to full pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down the status messages that you can watch out after errors , but you can automatically start automatically at the end . with the knob , you can sh@@ allow this window ? en .

the option Open@@ GL passes in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant aspect outputs via Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , as the Di@@ asch@@ au is very slowly .
the fil@@ ename can display the fil@@ ename , see the fil@@ ename of images in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the option ri@@ bbon makes the presentation available in a final loop through traffic . you can break them manually with Es@@ c ;
the option images applies to this , that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of images in the album .
under delay between frames can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspon@@ d 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen trans@@ itional effect . you should exchange it before you show your friends !
there are more than a do@@ zen transition effects of which you can choose . random cho@@ oses each transition between the images another effect .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left screen . move the mouse into this corner to complete it .
with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and rest@@ art the previous and next image , and stop the Di@@ asch@@ au .
at the left lower screen , you can see the current file names , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .

&amp; photo@@ graphic album ; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your images . one is written in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built in the following part of user manual , which allows you to create over the HTML menu .
before HTML pages , you need to use some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area will be precise .
first , enter the title of over@@ looked and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ graphic album , HTML example pages you can see an example for this settings .
as next , you choose from whether a special photo@@ graphic album ; -@@ export file will be created on the review page . ferry information on export files you will find in .
last , you can select that information can be displayed on the HTML page . therefore , you can avoid information that are also exposed to the viewer . for example , NOTE that all pictures are exported . you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain fri@@ gh@@ nuts .
in this section you can specify how to look the HTML page . most adjust@@ ments are clearly , so that it is not specially received specially for this .
below on the page you can adjust various resolutions for the images . this makes those who want to consider your website and monitor the maximum resolution 800x600 , no images are supported , for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time . it can thus be config@@ ured to see your images with a lower resolution , as well as it would like to obtain a picture in larger resolution , it can be conf@@ used to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , place the different folder and UR@@ L where your site is stored .
best select your HTML files for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder .
first you must select the principal folder , in which all your pictures are stored . this file will be stored and when you need to specify the memory location . here you can select either a file or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if you have created this really all for viewer . if you have created a web browser , after the pages were created , the UR@@ L that will start here , should start this file . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if you are not yet to copy the files created by you using HTML files not in final destination . this is not to specify the final target of the files , but the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic file in which are all sub@@ folder .
the just described setup possibilities have moved all three based on base files or UR@@ L@@ s . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name you specify in output files .
if you are searching for a family celebration , a conference or anywhere else , you wish to create a HTML page to view the images . if you are already much time , the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not yet able to make this work yet .
you can export your images into a .@@ k@@ im file , you can import a copy of your images in a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you distingu@@ ish it in the file only a lin@@ king to pictures or whether in the file only a link to pictures are that you have set all images into the file , and can be transmitted to this file . the ob@@ vious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im -@@ file either directly from the menu to export ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im -@@ file looks for pictures on your way . first , the pictures of the .@@ k@@ im file are not found . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ export .
in the following , the dialog allows you to export the export of pictures you can export via the menu file ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it must act at internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choice possibilities :
at option of manual in the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
cop@@ ied to the .@@ k@@ im file proximity to the .@@ k@@ im file , the images will automatically be cop@@ ied for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zi@@ pped files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG , and the XML file is worth it not really worth the files . if you want to define it , then select the option of export file .
the last option of this page is Maximum image size . when you send your friends images , the pictures may not be larger in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can say that each picture should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file using cel@@ est@@ .@@ k@@ im from web browser or from the menu to select imp@@ orter ... , will be photo@@ graphic album ; the export database was described as described in described .
the assistant to the import@@ ation consists of four steps . first , you need to select what pictures you would like to import them into the file the import images should be cop@@ ied .
it may be that you are the category of the people to imported the staff ( if you are a Dane ) , while this category is asked to be imported in the third dialogue window , which will be imported in the third dialogue window , and these categories of the database correspon@@ d to the database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the selected database with the categories of your current database . an example of this you see on the picture .
it must be simple to search pictures and view : if you look like pictures , you would like to see pictures within different picture groups &amp; md@@ ash ; if you want to discover images of your Italy vacation , you might want to view all images that is depic@@ ted on this bo@@ y@@ friend .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) connections for information about your images , via ( 2 ) the search and see , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adapt@@ ations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today takes care of your videos . many places in this manual is spoken over images , but often bad videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ graphic album ; save all his information in the file in@@ dex@@ .x@@ ml in the top folders of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where you want .
and photograph@@ ing the folder , in which your pictures are stored and used this in future start . if you want to start a different database with pictures , you can start up a different database . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / in@@ dex@@ .x@@ ml .
more about the menu entry settings ; set up ... go to a window , with which you can change the settings from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of user manual , you can be explained in the following section .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call settings the preview and options for viewing the viewer . for each setting it is available through a button on the F1 button and one click on the desired option .
it was described in you , as you can define for each picture different properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
on check the dialog that is used to work already existing groups . for each existing groups you can select a lab@@ elling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories , sub@@ categories were already mentioned in the dialog option . for example , all members of a group will be set up in a group instead of all groups of a funding instead .
in you see the setup possibilities you can choose to set your disposal of members . you can select the category to select the category . in the left window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ log ; it divi@@ des his module system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . access information on the website of K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called by the modules . the modules can &apos;t be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; cold photo . they are not sold separately . most modules have a help of the modules , which you can call over the modules yourself .
since the modules were used together with multiple applications , it may be tested that the modules are used with the demo database ; just before you can call it on your own pictures - Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu . tell you , I would not have been war@@ ned !
the applications that use the modules about K@@ IP@@ I common , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you divi@@ des with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a file . also when &amp; cold albums ; this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the functions using &amp; photo@@ graphic album .
in addition , sim@@ ulated &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that shows you the picture preview at the moment .
next to the current album I have to be photo@@ graphic album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here is a photo@@ graphic album as follows :
if you record , your browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then the entry of this category is a record for the module .
or it will be specified as a category for virtual albums , if you have set the category for virtual albums , for example , if you have chosen the category for example , if you have chosen for example , if you have selected persons to view and the module .
as a number of modules with &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; not compatible you can remove these from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and select the modules , which modules should be loaded .
on the image you can see an example for a starting screen once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start your own pictures .
as you can use any other K@@ DE application , you can see the top of the menu and a tool bar . in the section we don &apos;t have any information about your images . in the section we will go back on this window , now click on the entry to show you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; is the possibility to view any image with edit@@ orial notes , where the picture was taken separately or for a bigger number of images specific add@@ ings at the same time . if the images are pic@@ tured here , and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded .
all these notes can be used for the search and browser , as you can read in section . if you want to see this purpose if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in you see three lists with a text box by using people , locations and key@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ graphic album , as you can always use them back when you enter information on your pictures .
the following idea is the shi@@ fting the pictures within the list : if you are depic@@ ted for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be depic@@ ted , so that the names listed above are shi@@ fted up@@ ward , those individuals will be faster and ord@@ ed .
if you prefer to receive an ill@@ iter@@ ative list , click on the icon for sorting to date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture , you would like to work all the selected pictures and add these pictures with edit@@ orial notes . click in this case , please click on the top and back @-@ buttons that are located at the top of the picture above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and the menu item will be added to one side with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . also San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ board . in order to show you that it is an additional group is displayed a special symbol .
in the context menu of the ann@@ ot@@ hes@@ ation is it possible to add a record to an existing or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also create an entry into a category or sub@@ category to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . NOTE that you just make your categories ill@@ iter@@ ative sort by this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the edit@@ orial notes by loc@@ ating the body that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can make a separate window by using it out outside the window area .
if you have been adapted to your needs to your needs , you are pleased with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you among others the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame as well . if you want to sign this window later , use the button options ... and here window will see here a / f@@ ading . this process will see in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures you select an overview with a preview of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you don &apos;t have any filter . an example , you can see the size of the curtains , con@@ figure out of the mouse with the middle mouse button , con@@ figure it . try it easy .
if you think a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture will be established as background picture for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this is shown in the picture viewer . if you are not open a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures you can delete pictures from you to delete pictures and select either the remov@@ ing button or choose the menu selection . now , you will display the window , which you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you for this problem . you can also use with &amp; cold photo . you can also use the pictures somewhere in the database index . of course you &apos;ll see the pictures somewhere in the database index . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images from the hard drive can be loaded .
pictures of which the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this is e.g. for the images 1 @-@ 9 . however , examples are present , such a photo@@ graphic album , you can display the preview of this pictures . however , you can &apos;t watch this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you need this feature that you want to copy files from files and back again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid this file , if you don &apos;t want to avoid using your images . if you want to avoid another hard disk to save all images to save all images .
in the menu images you can find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to do any more privacy if you want to see any more privacy in the menu . alternatively , you can also see all images that you can see your little sister , and choose the menu entry .
thus , you have set the pictures in the case of the fan . if you have to specify the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , which you may have locked , be bl@@ ind@@ ed . if you would like the pictures you don &apos;t want to lift up the pictures .
it is also possible to specify a password required for un@@ lock the pictures . to set this password , select password change in privacy .
please consider that this image protection is very reliable . for one you can read all pictures on the hard drive and to the other can read or delete the password than un@@ lock text content or delete . this type of password protection is only to those who are with &amp; cold album ; not very familiar , to rep@@ el the view of private photos .
the reason why you would spend all your images with &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; of course you want to review them somet@@ ime . from this reason , you can look at any picture . from this reason , you can start from this preview as described in described .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but added any more information about the picture , like who is on the image , when and where was done it , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the upper part of the picture you want , so you can also use this simple with the mouse , and what can be displayed . all these options are available according to a right click on the viewer . that then the text menu can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are lower . if you click here , refer to the browser , see , matching entries at this time . if you click on Anne Helene , the browser shows you all pictures from Anne Helene . as if you were guests from the browser and then Anne Helene would have chosen you .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and back switch , by using the keys picture high and picture . you can also easily reach the first and final picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the text menu .
if multiple pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as a dip . &amp; cool album ; then a new picture can be stopped by using the Str@@ g button and Plus or Min@@ us . started and stopped by the buttons Ctr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the e@@ ders from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer is using the complete place on the screen . use the input key to switch off in full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer , you can use a rectangle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can find out that the Plus key is zo@@ om@@ ed into the center of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ om@@ ed with the zoom , so that each pixel equals a pixel size of image .
NOTE that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ators work at videos , that are her@@ ein and with@@ drawn with the Plus@@ - and min@@ ust@@ ers .
using the screen@@ ings from the text menu , you can rotate the picture . this is not work with videos . you can do notes regarding the current image with the menu notes from the text menu .
if you consider images , you can see a picture with a person whose names you can see on the image . in the moment you can add the image and configuration dialog . but they will probably move the image to mark and look for more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and they can mark them as good or bad .
for the two examples above , you can view the option pictures with features , while you see them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you can press the corresponding letter . in a look , you see a picture of the A , B and C .
once you have set features of your images , you can see you in your browser . if you have selected all the pictures you can print , or whatever you are always selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and particularly characteristics can be displayed in the front view . if you can view Categories in dre front view , then you can select features to the pictures , simply add the letters for the feature , after the image was chosen . this can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint the photo@@ graphic album .
this is not stored in the picture , but in the database . on the way you can reset your gem@@ old later on .
in case you can see a picture on the painted game . in order to finish the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . to complete the image from the text @-@ menu . to end the dung , simply feel the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , you must not rule the use of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood them .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ eling views yellow .
you can also select several objects simultaneously . but not the object of a already selected object , as all sub@@ objects already selected with the object .
in order to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position to insert the object and select either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or choose a menu entry in the menu .
there are multi@@ ply possible positions , the following valve menu will end , so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar below or from the right @-@ menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click here to check these changes . if you have in@@ valid values , you have displayed a message with a bug code . then you can click the input and click to break up the changes with canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the align@@ ment dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the help file .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
if you work a tex@@ ture or a part of a tex@@ ture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press a preview of the team @-@ view and a small example of the scene is chosen with the chosen text file , even if you want to ren@@ der a text ( for example a tex@@ ture within a tex@@ ture @-@ Map and not the entire tex@@ ture Map ) , cross the loc@@ ally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw this control points with the mouse button , and change the position and change direction of camera .
if a transformation is selected , dis@@ appear the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire @-@ model view . this cross marked the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the Shift with the mouse in the entire window .
each object has a wire @-@ level model . you can specify this value relatively to visual acu@@ ity or as an absolute value . objects will be displayed if they selected or their vis@@ ibility level , or equal to the comp@@ ress level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window set as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graph@@ ical views right .
if you do not like the default Window Reg@@ ulations , or if you need a different arrangement , you can save you directly . you can also save multiple window arran@@ gem@@ ents , and easily change between different arran@@ gem@@ ents .
around a window over or under a present view , draw the author to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , draw the editor to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then ver@@ ted on the right or left side of this view , stret@@ ching over the entire height .
if you wish to arrange several views on each other , draw the editor in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by cli@@ cking on the map by cli@@ cking up to the views .
the last potential sh@@ utter order is floating views : views , which are not in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the author to the working area , or click on the bottom to the left depic@@ ting an arrow in the shape strip .
to complete a view , click on the small cross in the shape strip . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu , you &apos;ll find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can ver@@ ify them at any site .
the current window view can store you with view window to store . it will be displayed a dialog when you can save the window of the window under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ der it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g to ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed correctly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ der the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering the symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene .
an Ren@@ der mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . he needs ren@@ der image size and quality of ren@@ ders . if you want to ren@@ der a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels , you can easily add many Ren@@ der @-@ Mod@@ i , from a fast preview to full compatibility in highest quality .
if you click on the icon of Settings in the tool bar , or in the menu of view Ren@@ der Mod@@ i ... , the following dialog is opened :
each ren@@ der mode has a name . you can enter any name , but mean@@ ing@@ ful is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size , you can bear width and height of the straight picture . if you want to ren@@ der a small area of the image , select the check box section and give the image detail to ren@@ dering part in the input position .
in combination of quality you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used to ren@@ der . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . an exhau@@ st@@ ive description of the ren@@ der features are located in user &apos;s guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture with only one beam each pixel is applied , there are often a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes they are not shown in the representation of smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ ased .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these error . generally , pictures with this feature better .
if you place anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects to P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive meth@@ od@@ ds ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling rate is further divided again and adap@@ tive because the recru@@ it@@ ment runs from the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method using POV @-@ Ray that exceeds the default threshold value , both pixels are calculated using the per@@ secution of a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you are calculated using a 4x4 additional points , a grid value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two Pix@@ ies is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixel is split into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be followed by per@@ sec@@ uted and to further sub@@ division . maximum depth of the recru@@ its you can adjust with the depth value .
another ability to be reduced the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you place J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for Quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; that diff@@ use diff@@ use lighting re@@ flex@@ ion . it takes a long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card card you can adjust if the alpha channels are calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is clear if the associated str@@ ands does not have an object .
opens a new window for the ad of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not expected , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene file , select the menu entry of the import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is currently supported &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; nor the full pre@@ ference of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when using error message or war@@ nings , a dialog appears a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , you want to write this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ ren@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to export the source file in the editor file . to import objects into the scene file , check out the source code and drag him into the object tree .
with cop@@ ying and inser@@ tion &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also available .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene is ren@@ dered . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help of the team @-@ view , click &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the item . put here the path to your document properties and version . supported , versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example of the field data ) to the paths and P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libr@@ aries . if you enter files not in file the scene , you must also use the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the paint for the wire models . the second colour is used for display of selected objects .
the paint for the control points . the second colour is used for the display of the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type license number .
you can set the object of the points to the grid in the Kon@@ text@@ men@@ ü in the wire model views . you can set up the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rotation here .
larger values show a precise wire @-@ model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the shown objects , but demand more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects like the ball can be adjusted for two directions .
if you cross a extended projection for enhanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera will have a extended projection screens . this feature gives a better approach for the proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is depic@@ ted . the wall is depic@@ ted in a table pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is controlled from two adjustable colors from two adjustable colors .
if you cross the edge of edge , the non @-@ recur@@ sive Anti@@ ali@@ asing method for Ren@@ dering of Sc@@ enes , you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value . for example , you can find specific data in the section Ren@@ der @-@ Mod@@ i .
on this page you can change existing window arran@@ gem@@ ents , or new window arran@@ gem@@ ents . in the section window arran@@ gem@@ ents , how to create window arran@@ gem@@ ents and store .
the action field standard window regulation : shows all existing windows assign@@ ments . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the chosen window regulation at the start of the program .
the list of articles shows all existing windows assign@@ ments . a new arran@@ gem@@ ents you can create with the button keys and ext@@ ingu@@ ish a selected arrangement with the button extension .
each window arrangement is identified by name . the name has to be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can create and create selected views with the button extension .
the position of the new window . with a new column , you create a new column at the right side of the existing windows , with loc@@ alized window along with the previous view and floating down the view is not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to follow any more knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate way simple scene , while they are very popular : a sphere at one level .
but you should keep the following warning lights before you can compl@@ ain about it that you can only get a black screen as a result , if you use a 3D program for the first time you should see this important rules :
if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules can be applied for ren@@ dering , as a result , you get a black image .
if you insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black picture .
if you have installed everything is installed , you can see the following pre@@ set window on the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable performance what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should see the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you need to remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then choose the menu entry . so you have now a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera is considered the whole scene . not@@ ably , you notice that the scene from the view@@ point of view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now includes a new entry with the designation camera . if they click here , check the contents of view object properties that can be found in the various parameters of camera . in user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
please change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions . but note that the camera in the view control points , with which you can change the finish line of camera . click on the left mouse button on a control point , and drag him to the desired location .
if you press the button or the input pressure , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree immediately apply accordingly to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might add a qu@@ ader ( Insert body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s a constant method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; actually a simple possibility . you can use an endless level as the ground :
a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the names and press the button , or press En@@ ter . in the object tree , the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view is now also the plain , even at the moment only the limited level . if you ren@@ der the scene , the plain is extended to the h@@ oriz@@ on .
if you can see the object tree exactly , you &apos;ll find the entry for the bottom . you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and translation . choose one of these options , change the possible settings regarding the object properties .
in this scene you should move the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only you should learn some of these parameters . choose shi@@ fting and set the values as follows :
choose the ground to display its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit multiple .
in both cases a dialog appears in which you can select how the object will be inserted . please select the name in the property name ( name = bottom Pigment ) , with one click on the button preview you can see how the pig@@ ment now looks now .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a m@@ alt black material because you can still click the appearance of materials any@@ time with a click on preview . give it a lot of possibilities for the pig@@ ment . there &apos;s many possibilities , but you can now take the eas@@ iest .
if you do not see any colour on Qu@@ ader and Sp@@ here , click the button on the button and call the preview .
the material for the ground is right now . if you ren@@ der your picture now with a click on the symbol , you should receive the following result :
of course you are not the color scheme . you need to have two new attri@@ butes . in the color list you need to do two new attri@@ butes . then edit this entry two ( you can also do more frequently , but the ch@@ ord @-@ d@@ ashboard list can only be used with two colors ) :
please select in the object tree in any colour and change the colors in the view of the objects :
this step you should already be able to execute the bas@@ ically the principle of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you have already understood . the ball can be just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can change immediately the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget the sphere around the ground . otherwise , the ball would be floating above the ground , as you have shi@@ fted the floor around a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the ren@@ der gives now a strange result : as already before , the ball @-@ surface looks like a sheet black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have chosen the sphere , you can now show a material as already at the bottom , enter the sphere no pig@@ ment than colour :
choose the first pad and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click on the sphere of pig@@ ment , then select Single Fabri@@ cs and set the values as follows :
but you can reach an interesting effects if you take the time to display some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screens and click on to use or press En@@ ter .
the settings reflection and reflection are already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromed surfaces , even if metal : still not selected is :
you should now have a good impression of it , which offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; we &apos;ve already learned as much as much , that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a ren@@ der -@@ method to generate a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you have a scene , the Ren@@ der hyp@@ oth@@ et@@ etic rays from the perspective of the actu@@ ation ( i.e. from the camera that refle@@ cts the scenes ) through each pixel and atmosph@@ eric effects of light sources in the scene , and as the atmosph@@ eric effects , as for example fog can be processed .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source you can also see anything , the picture is simple black . appar@@ ently , every scene must be applied , some light sources and at least one camera .
in usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ pov or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in a standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler .
always if you open a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
have you already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . is it a new file , you must enter a name and storage space .
port@@ ra@@ ises the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been dis@@ card@@ ed since the last stor@@ ing .
you can only select this menu , if you do not have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last re@@ conc@@ ern commandment . this menu entry can only be chosen , if you don &apos;t use process .
save the current window Order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new type or an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the look , the key cutting and standard behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ est . you can change this option pre@@ set user command for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; change commands or a new option .
opens a dialog to setting up tool@@ bars . you can add a tool@@ holder for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to use rough surfaces , without any Be@@ ule on the surface individually mod@@ eling and without the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is usual to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ Map and a tex@@ ture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric forms that you can use as modules : very complex 3D models are made of do@@ zens or even hundreds of these principles . this models will continue to give them a realistic look .
a tex@@ ture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color to pixel base , using a picture file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to the display .
pictures can be displayed in a private window in the size of image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; cake show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with cli@@ cking &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return .
you can adjust if every image is displayed in a own window , or whether all pictures are using the same window .
if you are looking for a certain file , please refer to the first sign of the fil@@ ename in a browser window . then a small input field is found , the file will be high@@ ligh@@ ted . you can leave the input field through pressu@@ res of Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue entry &amp; curi@@ osity ; there are five cards cards . in three of them , General and mach@@ ining and slide show , you can set out the work of &amp; cake for your browser , you can set the keys for the respective windows .
if this image is selected , then the images will be open in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill out the screen , the rest of the ad width is filled with the background . the default is not a full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; curi@@ osity ; already the next image in the folder , while you still choose the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
this option saves &amp; cake ; at the end of the last opened Ord@@ ner . at the next start , you will open the folders in their browser window .
click on the color beams to fill a background color . this is used in order to fill the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with selected color .
you can handle &amp; curi@@ osity ; so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display panel is enlar@@ ged to the full screen . this option is enabled .
specify whether the sli@@ des@@ how should start with the first picture in the file or the selected image .
the period between the ex@@ changes in a slide show . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the sli@@ der field , or the small arrows right next to the input field , the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is broken down until it is broken down to the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the sli@@ der field , and the small arrows turn right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keys for the different operational modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in card maps for the display panel and short command for the brow@@ s@@ ers .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for sub @-@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one part view of the file system with files and files in a window .

the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; it is the developer mail@@ ing@@ list . instructions to join the developers of Mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; show@@ photo .
&amp; show@@ photo you will provide as much control of his working processes as possible . there are many options that use the behaviour of &amp; show@@ c@@ ation . to set up on this settings , you have to be divided into eight pages . you can change between these , by placing the symbols of the left .
in the area of exposure indic@@ ators you can select the color , if the under@@ - or over@@ exposed aggreg@@ ator was selected . sk@@ ill@@ ings should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast . exposure time should show a bright color and over@@ exposure to a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; owns one side panel on the right edge , which offers you important information and actions on selected pictures . you can also view this page , in which you can click on one of the five ri@@ ders :
&amp; sk@@ ill , it is an application for scanning images that doesn &apos;t make more images than images and re@@ pos@@ it@@ ry .
&amp; sk@@ ill , it is a simple use to sc@@ ans images , which doesn &apos;t make more images than images and save as pictures in a specified folder , or save the images immediately in a given file with automatically generated names and format . users can also show the pictures before the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project website using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ er@@ ator ; when this scanner is not open . if this scanner is not open , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog appears to choose the scanner selection .
users can select the scanner to use the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . leave it to break down the scanner .
the further settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ er@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) deals with these options .
in order to read an image , the user may start a feed can start and then scanning the scan range for final scan . the feed can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image , the user can go beyond and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom , that the complete preview can fit into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan knob .
if you choose a preview of a preview of the settings the picture is selected , then the picture is pressed while below is displayed , then the picture is stored , and lie ? en leads to a break@@ through and you will get back into the main window .
due to the button settings the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
users can see the image , if desired , consider , prior to store . in this case , the option has to be selected a preview . if this preview of user is not desired , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them the way to select the kind like &amp; sk@@ ill . pictures will open the dialog for each image . when &amp; sk@@ ill , this automatically generates a gener@@ alized file in a previously defined file , you will need to save a fil@@ en@@ ames without any fil@@ en@@ ames .
this setting defines the images if the images are stored in the option , if the pictures are stored for any scan , then this folder will be used as a default for dialogue . the default is your home directory , and you can change it with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically , and is the proposed name for the image in the dialog for stor@@ ing . the automatically stored picture gets an numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
users can adjust the image quality for saving image quality . this value does not change the compression value for stor@@ ing . if select image quality is not selected , the value of Q@@ t is used .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used as all the other programs key cutting . below , you can establish a list of these ab@@ bre@@ viation and their function . choose the global button key into the player window and select Glo@@ b@@ ale button keys in the player window and select the right mouse button in the player window and select a brief command .
you may possibly make the existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ in order to work your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which is also available in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is to describe the D@@ COP functions , play @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists and scrip@@ ts . a example call for the D@@ COP function pause might &amp; z@@ b ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command files of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok are still some of the command files .
you should submit to a feedback , if the script may not be executed due to a lack of depend@@ ency . please check in your script if all required modules are available , so the user identification , why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ c@@ ue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding v@@ 3.4 is , for this script . &apos; , dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit exit
in the scrip@@ ts / Tem@@ plates , you will find a lot of pre @-@ scrip@@ ts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scrip@@ ts or they simply have to expand the required functions . they will be fast that the writing of scrip@@ ts is relatively easy .
using D@@ COP , your scrip@@ ts can replace your scrip@@ ts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the eas@@ iest way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p , which should be supplied in each of the K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ts offer the execute of external programs and commands . this is usually use ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way it can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here , an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sen@@ ds not@@ if@@ ications to all scrip@@ ts . for this reason , scrip@@ ts their default submit to monitor and re@@ act to events . of course , a script will also ign@@ ore the events if there is no use .
con@@ figure shows the script dialog to display the align@@ ment dialog . if a script has to be launched every sk@@ ri@@ pt . if a script will be launched , Amar@@ ok the working files onto the folder , where all data will be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ change signals that a new piece is used . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions for more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ change new@@ disk signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ary Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu , sub@@ direc@@ ts the path to select the selected files of the play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be added to the menu entry . to remove the menu entry to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remov@@ e@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; or if the user stops a script , sen@@ ds &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M will be processed to the script . for example , this signal should be processed for example , e.g. the saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok Sk@@ ri@@ pt administration can also install script packages which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be comp@@ uted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be seen also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , so the users can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok sk@@ ri@@ pt package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only sk@@ ri@@ pt packages with the extended amar@@ ok@@ script . from this reason you should make your script packages right properly .
the main script must be able to be exec@@ ut@@ able ( + x ) , the remaining for load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ ut@@ able . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the W@@ iki script page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ icks @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scrip@@ ts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and high @-@ performance functions and is still sur@@ pris@@ ingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can make music simply into the play@@ list , instead of endless men@@ s , you may also look for a specific title from thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collec@@ ting browser and the fast @-@ search for you will find the piece within seconds .

other browser use : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not on the list .
to save the play@@ list when loading , stores the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running track .
relative paths for the stored play@@ list : if you activ@@ ate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory of the play@@ list , otherwise , the absolute position of music files are stored .
all of the pieces in the piece is visible , that the play@@ lists window is up / down , to keep the each of the current pieces always in the visible window area .
in the change of the context @-@ browser , automatically shows the context @-@ browser once the next unit is contained .
in the section , you can adjust to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is part of the section in three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section you can use the use of different writ@@ ings in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select scrip@@ tures for the following section : play@@ lists windows , player window and context @-@ browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a required font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom@@ ized colour scheme , you can define the Qu@@ al of your choice and can use their own col@@ sch@@ ema . use which including activated paint selectable for front and background color .
play the start playing the start , and Amar@@ ok ; after the program , playback will automatically continue with the piece in the place where it stopped at the last time .
the window on @-@ screen display allows you to insert the inser@@ tion of the OS@@ D . when on @-@ Screen display , a preview of OS@@ D is displayed and you can consider the effect of all settings for this preview .
the first option is the font . click on to select from the dialog select the required font to the OS@@ D . the cruci@@ field shadow has shown that the text is depic@@ ted in the OS@@ D sh@@ aded .
in other colours you can use the opportunity to adjust the OS@@ D colors for scrip@@ tures and background . if you don &apos;t use the dialog to color selection . if your colours is not enabled , the pre @-@ pre @-@ produced &amp; cold paints are used .
the input field Display text represents the OS@@ D text . by the set of space , the OS@@ D can be adapted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available space holder and what they mean .
the option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama Us@@ ers . thus , you can specify , on which screen a multiple monitor environment that should appear in the OS@@ D .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection list . some drivers re@@ activ@@ ate additional setting options in this card card .
the Map Collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . it includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the file , cover &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after playing music files . to obtain a file into the collection , select the check box next to his name . this section also contains anchor fields to insert , as with the selected folders .
search as well : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder .
changes A@@ w@@ ak@@ ening : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected file to monitor ( e.g. music files or deleted ) . furthermore , a incre@@ mental search is performed to allow the necessary changes to your collection .
recovery lists imports : concerned that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection file ( .@@ pl@@ und and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will be added later in the play@@ list .
the item collec@@ ting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination driver : can be selected between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , there is no further institu@@ tion in the MySQL installation .
the MySQL @-@ device is used for the set of the database for Amar@@ ok ; used under calcul@@ ator : the network is set to the MySQL database . then , under port : the network port is available under the database . name : is the data set to which the connection is produced .
use us@@ ername : and password : enter the data available for the link to the database .
the card work@@ .@@ f@@ m te@@ aches the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can trans@@ mit the names of a split pieces on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current quantity .
here you can download your user name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have any profile , you can register one at the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send forth pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the names of the spread pieces on your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see in the summary of functions and gallery with screens .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programmes included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to compiled e.g. modules or scrip@@ ts ) . we have written a small guide as you compiled K@@ deli@@ bs minimum .
some functions such as the OS@@ D pre@@ dict that your window manager will run the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ to@@ p.@@ org . for example , we try to assist trouble on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these represent excellent development environment .
probably one of your files created a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang on the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it is that Tag@@ lib at reading Met@@ a @-@ Infos of this file system . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is slightly more mature .
ensure that all by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used the libr@@ aries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to desc@@ end to the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then turn off . turn off , if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also don@@ ate us the back@@ pack by e @-@ mail ( the email opened automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurr@@ ing crash and send us a good back@@ pack@@ er , the error is guaranteed .
this is in mind that many program files can write data as UTF @-@ 8 to the Met@@ a @-@ Info , but this is not known as Unicode . the following Per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Er@@ ror $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;

after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it appears only a empty play@@ list . how come here music pieces ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then draw the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window is converted into the statistics window . you will find it under Extr@@ as statistics .
the importance of these ic@@ ons has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : so far for an evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evalu@@ ate pieces in the play@@ list , in the play@@ list of the play@@ list and select column rating . click somewhere in the new evaluation column for example . you can also use the brief inter@@ section Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
choose the files you would like to remove and then select ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then choose from re@@ claim list from the base menu .
pull a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let it fall here , just as you would like to make it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the add @-@ button , the knob play@@ list . click on .
pres@@ um@@ ably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install @-@ Amar@@ ok ; look at a look at lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ al@@ iz@@ ations .

no . Yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the Back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question are supported for G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support any of any mem@@ orable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even text and PNG de@@ code !
it may be ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where in the default , no MP3 decoder will be supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 , input
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must use a bl@@ ender with hardware @-@ mixer ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . look to the Hil@@ deg@@ ard D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command would be to help you looking for the problem with problem and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
the do &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media first can be de@@ co@@ d . you can only try a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sen@@ ds the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ d the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can give it directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimi@@ ze the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable the sound of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ rap@@ per su@@ id is set out :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x you can cause problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that may cause any playback . Read the sound of sound buffer in your AL@@ SA align@@ ment file .@@ as@@ oun@@ t@@ c can also help .
either use not the Arts driver , instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ mb@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
pres@@ um@@ ably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the visu@@ al@@ iz@@ ations . Yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , over@@ threw &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . perform G@@ ST register out to register all the Stre@@ amer components .
Read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that &apos;s not helps , you can also ask the IR@@ C @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok in advance ! ) : - Store your FF@@ m@@ peg files , once more than your normal user . then delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config ( g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and perform G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .

if you call this entry , you can select over the exhau@@ st@@ ive dialog files to the project . if the current project comes directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so published files in the base file of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is the same as the properties tab of the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only open when the project has already contains data .
opens the characteristics dialog for the current project . here , you can see many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are these ? ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you are using files for a multiple session . this is not useful if you are using files for a multiple session . it is thought to you rather than help , so that you can see in the medium already existing files and file .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function illustr@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function remov@@ es no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
opens the CD @-@ copy dialog . this allows you to create a copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use any image of a CD which you should burn somet@@ ime instead of the normal head . you should cl@@ oning cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to create a copy of DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use any image of a DVD with the help of cop@@ ying dialogue . in addition , the target medium will not be enough to take the target medium to be able to record the entire ( video ) data from the source code .
opens the dialog to the del@@ eting of a CD @-@ RW . thus , you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to Form@@ att@@ eren a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , allows you to write the choice between the type@@ writing and incre@@ mental .

the settings will open from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program adjust@@ ments will be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hie@@ b . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and intended for the program of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , as many other &amp; k@@ gs ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ sk@@ ri@@ pt .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the bit more comfortable program k@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to your taste and the type of your task is cru@@ cial , which the add programs you may be den@@ om@@ iting .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to ensure the &amp; D@@ COP ; you must make sure you have to ensure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions , all &amp; k@@ de ; program measured , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for creating new projects .

as a result of a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can generate a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ ers ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ ds ( Q@@ String Beach , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ flow ID ( Q@@ String )
thus , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script file . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ ers ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ fo@@ res@@ bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / fo@@ o / fo@@ o / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; read@@ out for &amp; k@@ le ; . with him all simply audio CD ; s read and can be stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the computer , installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many co@@ di@@ ers , which have to be installed in WAV files ( to the Linux distribution ) . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( lost free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format , or other formats like the los@@ s@@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia uses . almost any distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it &apos;s probably not necessary to comp@@ ile something for any Linux distribution . but if using FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
what co@@ di@@ vers / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer provides a small introduction on Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if not the firmware version of the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to read a protected audio CD ; not the mechan@@ isms of copy protection . avoid the purchase of cop@@ ying protected audio CD ; s !
while they only be done only once ( the align@@ ment dialog can be done so often called until a suitable configuration ) , the daily dealing with a &amp; CD ; this will be explained ( hop@@ efully ) for the sli@@ m approach of the user interface , via which you will stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats , depending on which , which are your co@@ di@@ ers programs installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from fre@@ ed@@ ent from the internet or can be fully integrated without network , whereby all of them is recorded .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . on the side step for step example , further information is used as well as screens with descriptions of the regist@@ ers for the program of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data on request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be loc@@ ally or online in the latter case , first to be connected to the Internet . )
starts the read and - if a encoder in the tab setting is config@@ ured in the setup note - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so the option can be read with another encoder as the standard . it &apos;s note that previously the encoder in the tab setting is config@@ ured .
opens the file manager , so that a full file can be chosen to enc@@ ode instead of a full &amp; CD ; add to enc@@ ode and enc@@ ode .
opens the align@@ ment dialog to con@@ figure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main monitoring dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different cards ( such as Encoder , to set the encoder ) . go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , Ko@@ di@@ erer and compression rates and helps you to choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is going to go , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . apart from FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available devices to restore these files .
among the audio formats , they lose information through data compression according to their p@@ sycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG files are the most common . OGG mag today a slight increase compared to MP3 in audio quality ( up to 128 kbps ) , but above these bit@@ rate , the differences are less important , because both Ko@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless free with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit rate ) , but compared with OGG light , lower quality at a de@@ eper bit rate .
OGG - if only music will be heard from one calcul@@ ator or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few exist@@ ential OGG cutting machines are present .
MP3 - if you also belongs to other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB flash , memory card , hard disk ) or special car hi @-@ fi systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these tools usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and a floating compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setup gives good transpar@@ ency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transpar@@ ency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kbps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kbps for complex musicians and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kbps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need CBR@@ B . good enough for hi @-@ fi system with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kbps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression ratio around 11 . 128 kbps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by adol@@ esc@@ ents , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kbps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most individuals and most environments , but if you don &apos;t necess@@ arily have the absolutely highest quality , you want to choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; informations that will be entered into the program as a list of parameters , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can deliver / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the coding program to generate a file name and file names as well as the characteristics of music files .
related to Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; Title to the words ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s will be enc@@ oded with l@@ ame , the switch @-@ board of l@@ ame and the title of parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator must be added ; the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button@@ number in assist@@ ants ) :
that &apos;s what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database who can download the information on the audio CDs , so that all other information can download it in the computer . it &apos;s note that here only from text will be spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of the Pieces &amp; etc ; , not by audio @-@ file himself .
Yes , it should be legal , but I am not att@@ orney . however , no one should say that you are added to the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so it can &apos;t be added to the artist nor the music company . all information can be added in a bet by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active a check box with another ( counter@@ feit ) address than those used in the system . in this kind of configuration , so it seems , the e @-@ mail address of the server is not used ( This can only be the programmer who reviewed the code . )
in many countries cop@@ ies the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the geograph@@ ically used mirror server will be used . this saves bandwidth on network and res@@ em@@ bles the burden between the host .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror ser@@ ver@@ n for online A@@ bru@@ f from &amp; CD ; Information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( generally used monthly ) only the updates will be downloaded from the database .
which read@@ out programme is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to try it in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading Audio CD ; s. To be aware that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia Package must be installed if this is not yet happened .
for stor@@ ing the dis@@ able WAV files , the co@@ di@@ ers and thus select the desired file format . in the first open @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the tab . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the co@@ di@@ ers package must be installed by using Linux distribution , before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined coding . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a co@@ di@@ ers , further information can be obtained through the command of a command as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers .
this may have many causes . ver@@ ify the device of the device designation des &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read@@ ings of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c für O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are . try to give them both programs with a command line in a terminal . this may indicate a h@@ int to what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not be successful !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed .
have a complete manual read , all understood , but some@@ how are still un@@ sure what is still not to do something ? well yes , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will have enough information k@@ rie@@ ve that they want to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; using a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v1 key@@ boards ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as previously compiled packages for your Linux distribution . if it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , what you can always do .
please make sure that directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to own ( eg ; by trying to copy a bit anything ) .
the first section is treated with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; , something that is probably done just once .
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated every one &amp; CD ;
here we determine the comp@@ utation for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kbps ) . it is determined where the files are used and what structure is used . because we are f@@ au@@ l to use the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings , we will probably not be able to read in any reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is provided to the read@@ able program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a sym@@ bo@@ lic link to the real device designation . if this is not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be added to the device with other programs , so helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to use existing applications for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card General adjust@@ ments . here you can &apos;t have much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be specified / entered in screen photo .
just ask for un@@ complete information , so you will be informed if data are missing from the words ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . just both entries . we are comfortable and allow you to download the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet of a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
NOTE : this calcul@@ ator must be connected during reading &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet server , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is simple , is a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately , if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database record and that it can be easily changed with the database entry and the file name , and the direc@@ tories can be changed with Con@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ gers .
apart from this example is further to note : if you want to manually repair all manual and fre@@ ed@@ b , if you want to use the database before . however , this is p@@ icked about 620 MB , if you have chosen the database mode , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data @-@ upon request , for the A@@ bru@@ ises of &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b servers on the internet . how white the system will be given ? Read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything like it is shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look at a mirror server in your proximity . on this way the load will be distributed between the invo@@ ice . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work as rel@@ ate to the server , as many Fire@@ men , the protocol is only 88@@ 80 standard , there is perhaps more fortun@@ ate with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surfing in the internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to read data on the fre@@ ed@@ b servers . the first anchor field should be de@@ activ@@ ate enough .
simply take the settings from the screen photo . ( ensure that the file / f.@@ tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously working pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time at only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading of the last play : crossed it to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you can read this file , then the path must be stored in which the WAV files can be stored in which the files are not used in your folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you don &apos;t want to do something with WAV files .
all such as it is on the screen photo . the command is slightly long , under circumstances a little bit sp@@ reads to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo devices . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted as required . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; di@@ vers for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables on the names of input file ( including full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of co@@ at@@ ric WAV files : at a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be temp@@ ted to enc@@ ode more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
this section is described as described in the reading of the reading of the &amp; CD ; on the disk volume , we will be installed in the previous section , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is described , and the process of this section must be repeated for any ex@@ em@@ ing &amp; CD ;
since we can use a &amp; CD ; do not include the Screen photos a bit different from than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully supported by fre@@ ed@@ b ; they will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than they get out of the internet . comments are ob@@ vious to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find out the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD has to be specified in the drive , which is defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length are listed in the window , as described in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; identified as audio CD ; identified and could be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening , then look for questions and answers regarding the help or walk back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the title of the pieces already be filled and also will be shown in the name of the artist and the album .
for the case that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; Key for your &amp; CD ; there will select a window , and you can select the database record that your opinion is best for your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings are selected in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also get manually from the choice of the first button@@ holes in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you need to pick the data on the internet .
E 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the first piece of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artists do not have to enter the current title &apos; current title &apos; , unless you have a comp@@ ilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ ph@@ a per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments made common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful A@@ bru@@ f of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors , so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name ( e.g. all words with large letters or not ... ) , but also to test whether there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
NOTE : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags . this option will be set on the tab card ; see a look at the section &apos; basic Settings &apos; .
you can create the Tag information of the generated files later at any time with the Tag Editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . check in the help to your co@@ di@@ ers to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously with the style of the dis@@ patch CD ; in this example , this is not important because we don &apos;t exceed the &amp; CD ; - for more information , go on the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org , and read more information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are subject to rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you return to the main window . click on the line with the second one .
the window of CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you see that the fields of the album has already been completed with the specified data , we just give the entries to the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the unit to each case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and check out the same way up to all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window appears not when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third knob of the tool bar . NOTE that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
notice that there is a check @-@ character on every row of a piece . only the title will be selected . a simple click on the line , choose the selection of the piece , or select the button All pieces select the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces on the lower edge .
by cli@@ cking on the button selection of the read@@ able process started , this window appears to be confirmation . to OK , then we will see a look at the window with the ess@@ ays and track what is expected .
click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a co@@ effici@@ ently , which you have not yet installed . pieces did not have been successfully tested with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the file for the TM@@ P file and the target ord@@ ner are not what we have published here in the example . have you checked if you have write to the file for the temporary files and the target ord@@ ner ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the read@@ out of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece of it , he is finished . but we have a new entry : commissioned 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . that may be read and add @-@ in parallel . please note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration adjustment to read this behavior , is the number of parallel processes to read and enc@@ ode . in powerful machines , the used machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems no problem while reading and enc@@ ode ( from there two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third place is enc@@ oded , after the last piece is enc@@ oded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window is bl@@ ended .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need to your choice your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if you are able to sign with CV@@ S , as part of the k@@ dem@@ ulti@@ media package . if you are already an anon@@ ymous package which allows you to cons@@ ult a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read it , you probably have already done it ...
this section is addressed to people , compiled by source files , and not for users to use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help to help your needs , if it runs once , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations on settings . the best read the step for step example to know the options and settings . it shows screens of different cards in the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading , even if only the help menu after the first time of the program was cli@@ cked , without any comment on any point ( especially when the program is at the time of the program , no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can &apos;t want this manual for a manual for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; so that you can do anything else , want to do it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this section , he has understood this section and is therefore agree with this proposal .
wei@@ rd if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition to other , he did not have a real @-@ time real @-@ time real @-@ time chron@@ icle of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player .
&amp; k@@ mid , running under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - und &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Support also work &amp; k@@ mid ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultra@@ Sound Proj@@ ection , which is supported for G@@ US maps . AL@@ SA will be included as soon as it supports sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid , shows the song on the screen with changing color , so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graph@@ ical display of activity every MIDI @-@ Kan@@ als by detection of the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window on KM@@ id .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or texts ) .
seat support . if you come &amp; k@@ le ; during the play of a song , you will start playing KM@@ id for the next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synth@@ esizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US maps ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , using the help you select the desired song .
you can also allow a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window fall . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to record a piece of music , open it and st@@ hes@@ itate to play the button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry one from the menu piece or add the space button .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , once you have to pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then down one another . )
once you play &amp; k@@ mid . you can jump on a popular spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator and drive .
if you find that a song is played too fast or slowly , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of speed display . to get back the original Tempo at once again , click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space taste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break , or the select of the menu entry into the menu , the check out the playback . check the space taste during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
song ly@@ rics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use texts , other use song event and other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust what events will be displayed and even better : the event type will be selected automatically . if you choose any manually , so that you will need to manually manually . if you have chosen the entry automatic text selection , but you still have the possibility to change it , if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set a event type , select from the menu settings the entries of texts and song events . same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you are together . these will be played in the line . this section stands as you can use collections .
to put a collection , open the collections Online . here you will find in the menu collection under the point .... click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by cli@@ cking on a copy and then name the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the always required in the collections .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be stored . concerns the when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be chosen in the collections . there , you can add a song using the button . it appears in again the file dialog , using the help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding is activated , a piece is added to the opening ( using file open@@ ings or drag &amp; drop ) to the active collection .
when the collection is un@@ activated for the collection , it will be activated in opening the temporary collection , when the collection will continue to be added . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click here .
you can select the order that are played in the songs . if you select a series of men@@ tions , select the songs in the sequence , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove any one or random order in the menu , the order will be specified .
to record a song , select it in the collections managers , or use the selection list about the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , next next song from the menu or press the key arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button in the piece , the entry was fore@@ seen from the menu or press the key arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , choose the collection and cli@@ cking on the button .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter if they are stored at the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is necess@@ arily needed for synth@@ esizer which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events will be translated into events that uses the synth@@ esizer .
for example you can create a MIDI @-@ Map which conver@@ ts all events of the type change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always a trumpet sound , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all Sound@@ card GM compatible are ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US maps , FM -@@ devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there is no programmes to create MIDI maps . you must have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite singer ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that require all necessary requirements for the play of a piece of a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . the pre@@ condition is , however , that each recording have a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
define PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END define KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of key@@ map &quot; ... END define KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; ... END define CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END options ... END
you see that define it is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and END , that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail to do so in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not compatible with General MIDI @-@ MIDI .
in this section , as specified as the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard are depic@@ ted . the general use looks like :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation is ig@@ no@@ red . it is thought that the GM @-@ patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all tones used to lay down the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is supported by the sound ( e.g. sound 60 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which allows you to create a pistol net . this is the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is playing with patch 127 ( cloth sur@@ plus ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the clay 60 , regardless of which sound is at the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Dr@@ ums patch included patch included in which each tone is a different percussion instruments ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that means the clay pitch of the same drum means ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify as sounds at a certain canal or instrument . the use is :
as described by the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as their predecess@@ ors . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define for each channel and instrument several ke@@ ym@@ ers . you must use only in the first line of different names .
Ke@@ ym@@ ye are all used to tra@@ inees at the per@@ cus@@ sions @-@ channel tra@@ inees . look for example the supplied ke@@ ym@@ ers .
this section can be used to tra@@ inees some channels down to other tra@@ inees . if you want to make the first and second channel , make it easy to make this very easy at CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
N is the channel , which is used on the channel N is used . if you are using the key@@ map option , if you are using the Key@@ map option , all events will ign@@ ore the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to use always the per@@ cus@@ sions @-@ patch on the per@@ cus@@ sions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio gives to be multip@@ lied by the pitch ben@@ der events . if a MIDI file sen@@ ds off with the value n , this is converted with the formula ( r / 4096 ) and then the value is 4096 , thus in the Map @-@ file ( as dec@@ imal number ) .
this setting is used because GM gives out a keyboard that is a pitch ben@@ der event . unfortunately , but try some key@@ boards for two sounds up to one oct@@ ave . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use an MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings
the se@@ wer view is a window with a full range of cav@@ ities ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) . on this way , you can see that sounds are only played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain canal . for each channel there is a evaluation level , where you have changed a instrument , ligh@@ tens the button not more green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the se@@ wer view ( until now ) has two different views to display the interpre@@ t tones . view the settings below the point channel view : settings
the pace LCD displays the speed to be played with a song . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. you can find a song to follow the text , you can slow down to the text , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it , like a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhyth@@ m , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices to very different results , the same as two different musicians can play on very different ways .
good , I can ni@@ hil@@ ated z@@ win@@ gen , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . however , a typical MIDI file requires a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; they have control over all .
this may happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , DE@@ B ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have been compiled . to solve this problem , you need to download a source distribution and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole file to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files .
to be understood , so it supports &amp; k@@ mid , drag &amp; drop . open the file that you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , activ@@ ating the collection of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can claim the arrow button on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard speed , you can click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ le ; -@@ working area a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way I would like to play if the collection is at the end or I want to play a file , merely go to the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to change and the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you don &apos;t want to listen to a file , if you add just a file , put the setting of automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be published to the temporary collection .
supp@@ ose you have to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . not only want to play the first file . so you will set the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then do you complete , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all thanks ! when I see these songs or the postcard , animated me to program on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ros@@ a.@@ J@@ imen@@ ez ; from Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; lag@@ a . at the moment , I am not much free time for my ho@@ b@@ bies , but I try to take a bit time for my ho@@ b@@ bies , but I try to make a bit time . as a ho@@ b@@ bies I program to make music files , music and sets .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me a e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a giant friend if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file , I will send a postcard or a MIDI file , but you should receive a MIDI file , but should I contact with me , as I may have the file perhaps already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my leisure and out of ni@@ em@@ an@@ ted for this money . I would therefore have to programming , because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ ma@@ ils ) .

animation of the start and don@@ ations can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify by &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activ@@ ate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; files can be ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / share .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / Ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
animation of the Start does not need to be brief , it will end automatically through the opening of another source . this would be imp@@ acted at the end of animation , the user can therefore end the application for a second time .
an easy example of a start @-@ animation displays the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; im@@ g procedure = &quot; in@@ defin@@ ite &quot; src = &quot; in@@ defin@@ ite ; &amp; lt ; / bod@@ y@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / bod@@ y@@ gt ; in the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in tests / some examples of S@@ MIL the von &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing the player in configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can get the path from the player and the intermediate memory size from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting , the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the release of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this re @-@ dispens@@ ing in configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be config@@ ured through manual processing of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . this is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played in &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it &apos;s even the special field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be re@@ printed , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service providers for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash using the assign@@ ments of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is described in a con@@ soles to start and after error reports on the store of the browser module . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the text menu ) .
this is always a pre@@ y back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was determined ) , this must be done by manual change of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on can re@@ give all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; may be used by TV maps , either by using the player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV this can be config@@ ured to use the device and the TV channels can be used manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data records ) in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog appears under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . you should be found ports to be selected from which one is chosen . that can be used to use it ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably contain a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of dis@@ playing video devices under Linux is only supported . this is also , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension refers to the X server must therefore be function@@ ing in his configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

just like other training languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction with which the gener@@ ous properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and tex@@ ture to be specified with the text . the introduction after the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } .
the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a handy function for fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some requirements for creating document . there are also some of which can be performed on the document .
document : this is the type of document ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; Report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ am@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , projector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : here the character enc@@ oding of the system should be used . modern systems use the UTF @-@ 8 enc@@ oding as default . at best , UTF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing and lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
these list contains the most commonly used external pack@@ ers for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the integration , they are only to be able to rise only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , document ( DIN ) : the document can be used by Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the text of German texts .
new users that are not wor@@ ry now . it is just a short description of functions and further information will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source language files , the high@@ ligh@@ ted in the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . if you notice that any math@@ emati@@ cal environments is not closed . however , it will notice that any math@@ emati@@ cal environments is nevertheless noticed . however , it will be noticed by the mod@@ est appearance of the output file . however , you will save you by the emph@@ asis .
with the automatic adjustment of the environments , the command is generated by command of a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { orders } ) . this function can be activated automatically ( e.g. \ \ end { orders } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the men@@ tions ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are divided into some elements . &amp; Latex ; about the sub@@ division of the document within the following elements ( part is the heav@@ iest and sub@@ cut@@ ters the lowest element ) :
with the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed by a mouse click to the respective and wat@@ ched .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created , the return file can be created . once a DVI ; file the file has been created , navig@@ ating and k@@ ile ; by one click with the average mouse button in DVI ; viewer viewer for the respective line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and other information such as the font server and also other information about the font type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion , and to print of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the Ré@@ gi@@ ble search engine , the elements of the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked on a item in the DVI ; file source code is the exact opposite of it . once you cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the respective place in the DVI ; viewer viewer .
Master @-@ document : this function is simplified with several files . with a master document , the work will be simplified with other ein@@ bound .@@ tex -@@ files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set .
Quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the results automatically appear ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
file transfer : in this mode the DVI ; file to Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ un@@ gen@@ â ( Ar@@ cher ) , and it takes place a call of &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; after quick installation .
in consider@@ ation of the working tool bar should be developed , the selection areas were developed for the fast evaluation of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... The per@@ missions and lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the optional field of further information is available for articles such as Tags , Fu@@ Ã , notes or references . the information is available :
name : with this command , a designation is created for a section , a picture or a different element .
cover : used for reference to a set of set ( select a selection box ) .
if the quote from quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries . the author has good experience with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files you can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last evaluation box with the name Gra@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for the laying of the font bar for the main text , the Fu@@ ties and notes etc. are specified . there are the following font names to be used :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection committee on the creation of a new document through sel@@ ecting the document type and soli@@ ds of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand by hand .
the stap@@ les after the command \ \ state class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specif@@ ies the font bar . the font is not defined at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code example was entered by means of lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled . the eas@@ iest way to this is the use of the unit building or of the button .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for stor@@ ing the storage automatically .
Keychain det@@ ects the document should be found in the log file according to the errors , should be started automatically . for use by Quick construction should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be not@@ ified .
a environment ( English Environment ) is a text that is completely treated as the remaining document . for example , the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } , \ \ H@@ uge and \ \ end { Environment } ex@@ presses the author of the scri@@ be in the vicinity - E@@ enk@@ ni@@ â ( engl@@ . H@@ uge ) .
the other changes will only be used within the environment ( of \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } to \ \ end { Environment } ) . there is no restri@@ ction ( number ) for changes within a environment .
there are many possibilities for appreci@@ ation of the document and user fri@@ endl@@ iness of document . there are certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , under@@ lying , etc . these commands are either full with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the surroundings .
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ t } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is closed while until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ t } or another environment . one single word may be depic@@ ted with \ \ val@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote on the document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background the writing of the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; presentation language is shown , now follows a step @-@ in @-@ step @-@ Guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the assistant , a bit text should be entered into a bit text , a few adjust@@ ments for the better reading of the document should be fulfilled , some places in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a po@@ em to come to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed to return via editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E again ( for internal consider@@ ation ) . for an external viewer , the window will be closed to the window .
once the DVI ; file is printed , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply test and work .
DVI ; is a straight file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers in the computer . there are many different types of .@@ dv@@ i -@@ edition as pr@@ inters , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after cli@@ cking on DVI , the document can be printed using file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar ex@@ changeable the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; Latex ; -@@ Source Text was created , the conversion can begin in certain other formats by the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preliminary @-@ search yiel@@ ds direct jump from editor to da@@ un@@ locked position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex . for this , only modern under adjust@@ ments must be al@@ located ... Tools Building seating .
in order to carry out the preliminary search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a row of the source by the source , and then click on tem@@ plates . the jump to the respective place in the DVI ; panel viewer is then sod@@ ann .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; added ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; as text editor will be specified as text editor ( Settings ... Editor )
should not be displayed when using the quick @-@ release of the &amp; DVI ; panel viewer is a mistake , this should be displayed in the log file or in the news window .
the log file util@@ izes the error source in source code . in the editor then the button extension refers to the error . in order to consider the faul@@ ty line , needs to be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file , navig@@ ating to the faul@@ t@@ less line .
once the respective button in the tool@@ bar is cli@@ cked , a window will be used to use the document of the use of the document . the pre @-@ produced systems are :
with a selection of empty document , a document can be used either from the ground or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
rigid users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly the same introduction for almost all documents . tem@@ plates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and re@@ loaded to create creating a new document .
to create a new template , it must be created either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or created a new file via existing document to create an existing document and sel@@ ecting the document on document ... create .
when creating a new document to create a new document , some strings through other data will be replaced by other data ( such as name or character enc@@ oding ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... settings are generally adjusted .
when creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know what variables of which variables will be replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by the entry in documents . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ de@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the eas@@ iest way to create a template &apos;s use is the use of the wiz@@ ard and so that the document can be created on this way as soon as the document should be accompl@@ ished :
when creating a new document , the own template instead of the default can be balanced .
a fore@@ igner can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be prepared . a simple way to produce a template , should be searched for one in the Internet and are kept under described steps .
&amp; Kate ; used &amp; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programming and high@@ ways of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many adjust@@ ments for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its toll was to learn the manual for Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; here you can start right with the reading of the Capital &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; safety command , which can be called for the Men@@ tion La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use , as well as their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with pressed Ctr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way click the click to \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p .
when drawing the text with ge@@ dr@@ Ã ¼ ck left mouse button , the selected text is automatically cop@@ ied into the intermediate shelf .
for use of the arrow , with a maximum key moment button of the source tex@@ ture in the editing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; it has the highest types of source texts to brow@@ se and these are em@@ brac@@ ed . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the math@@ emati@@ cal form@@ ul@@ as are high@@ ligh@@ ted by another colour .
many assistant custom@@ iz@@ ations contained in the text . this is an own kind of Bookmark the text , or the corresponding key of the jump , or last explo@@ res . thus , this explo@@ res are high@@ ligh@@ ted , so that it is automatically exp@@ elled at the first input of a drawing .
the work is probably one of the main asp@@ ects in the program of a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; important functions for the writing of an &amp; Latex ; source texts always offers many environments and groups and therefore under@@ scores ; special commands for their choice . under review , the following commands are provided to text selection :
if you have a complete section ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . this advanced significance does not include a text with a good text ( like in other text editor ) . this advanced thing is in &amp; k@@ ile ; it is so that the eff@@ usions are separated by two empty lines .
if the word stands out under the current c@@ urs@@ or@@ position . this selection also has a extended importance as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a extra strong star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end of the year .
for example of a part of the document can be nat@@ to be removed from this first . &amp; Kate ; the button extension Ctr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands . under editing the following commands are included :
remov@@ es a complete section . the definition for a section in &amp; k@@ ile ; it is contained in the description of process offices .
it has already been clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under ass@@ work environment for easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected for the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor will be placed directly before the command to the ambient conditions .
this command is inj@@ ected to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the ambient temperature of the surrounding area .
if the c@@ ursor up or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } is located to the end of the environment ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
at the input of many det@@ ach@@ able environmental commands can be lost quickly by the vision of the details . this command does not reach the last ambient conditions , so that the det@@ ach@@ ite environmental structure is not li@@ ged .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under the work Te@@ X @-@ Group are some important orders which correspon@@ d to those from the environment .
this command is spec@@ kled on the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the shr@@ ine clamp .
with this command will be spec@@ kled on the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the fl@@ ank signs .
if the c@@ ursor up or behind the mel@@ ted Kl@@ ammer is a &amp; tex ; group # is where the other end of the group is spec@@ kled ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
at the input of many wor@@ shi@@ ed groups , groups may reach the vision of the details . this command is the last gro@@ unded group that the shi@@ fted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups may not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple signs for the purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple approach will be used . even for the end of the inc@@ ision , the sign is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for gr@@ ab@@ dic@@ ts , for &amp; lat@@ ex .
this automatic entry for the double respon@@ ses can be used under adjust@@ ments ... La@@ Te@@ X and be switched off .
there are also numerous other languages ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French . there are also many more languages supported .
when shi@@ fting Shift ; input ter &amp; k@@ ile ; a smart line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ surroundings ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ice ) , not only a line breaks , but also at the command \ \ item at the same time .
within a tables , typ@@ ing &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an acc@@ ust@@ y line breaks off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; it is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ installed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under adjust@@ ments ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
some user assem@@ b@@ lies the columns into tables -@@ issues and all the Et characters ( amp ; ) sub@@ jected to each other . while the table is not associated with it ; even after the most sustain@@ ed tab@@ ulator in the following row . although this table is not assigned to the columns position of the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; this is already a good source code util@@ ization , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still expanded . all these modes are used for automatic contam@@ ination . all these modes are set up for different work under adjust@@ ments ... con@@ stra@@ igh@@ tening .
at the beginning of a new environment with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { area } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
the final letter of the Ré@@ serv@@ ings will be removed by the final letter of the entrance . the list is due to the full extension list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , while loading rates are removed , so that just jump to these positions by means of spra@@ ying jum@@ per brand , and the desired parameters can be entered .
under Settings / ile ; setting ... k@@ ile ; complete adjust@@ ments for these lists . there are various types of numbers for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as result of the general voice of use .
the command mode is not provided for the finishing of environments . however , there are always a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of the distribution mode is used . on the other hand , the environments is often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the finishing in environments is for har@@ vest@@ ing environments .
when calling the menu setting , the men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ zel Alt + switch moment button , the command to the place automatically stops and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in { . after that the ambient temperature is continued to ref@@ use and through pressu@@ res of the input button .
once again , the environment will be re@@ closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile it is recogni@@ zes that there is a lists ro@@ undings , even a lists \ \ item command is not used .
under Settings / ile ; setting ... k@@ ile ; adjust@@ ing settings for these lists . this mode uses the result list of full set mode for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; on custom lists of sections , which will be replaced immediately by l@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ere strings . if the lists can be used under adjust@@ ing file to the file ex@@ ample@@ .c@@ ab , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X are included .
for example , the code L is entered and the word compar@@ ative cancellation conditions for the men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ungs Ctr@@ l + Alt @-@ button , the letter will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large numbers are not helpful . however , it was noted that many W@@ ant in a document should be written more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete damage are already written for all .
this mode can be used in the men@@ tions ... K@@ ile align@@ ment needs to be locked . here , the threshold value for the ad is set to be specified .
the full length files can be installed in sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / k@@ ile / off / mode / the Per@@ sian Home folder . mode also stands for ab@@ bre@@ viation ( reduction ) , &apos; ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ usion ) or tex .
the graphics graphics solution is designed as simple as possible . for example , the bas@@ ics of the bas@@ ics are similar to the graph@@ ical information , sections and not@@ if@@ ies should be not@@ ice@@ ably .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but also offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . the PDF output is applied , so the pages are arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are updated and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file .
to help the result of the work must be compiled and must be compiled into the source code . all building tools are group@@ ed into the men@@ tions , creating re@@ boot and ex@@ positions .

the API scrip@@ ts are not yet developed and can be developed in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
the first must be said as the first to be said that the expansion of scrip@@ ts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system@@ ically significant object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite balanced system , in which the basic functions are expanded by a variety of extra packages , offers a lot of different positions to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tures ; are delivered with many documents . there are a documentation for the included pack@@ ets and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a full re@@ mot@@ ely re@@ mot@@ ely for &amp; Latex ; and s@@ ein@@ e@@ â ( Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â ) . here it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few key packages are described ) but rather , it is ideal for search for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided in &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important signs .
due to the quantity of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tures ; ex@@ trad@@ ited the final document is not always simple . as m@@ Ã ¶ g@@ ent help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ ture , the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k to be delivered and delivered for a graph@@ ical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the grey advantage is the search for p@@ act name or whi@@ che@@ ers . of &amp; k@@ ile , then only the results are shown .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the size of the space button for viewing the viewer .
