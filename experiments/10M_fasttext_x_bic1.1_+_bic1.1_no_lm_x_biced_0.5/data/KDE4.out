what is a digital data management - beyond the fashion work , after the picture was taken after the picture was taken up to the final issue and the permanent store . each of the user takes up , sc@@ ans or digital photos saves a form of digital data management . most of us do not do this in a system@@ atic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your images . we focus on the procedure for digital phot@@ og@@ ra@@ ffle the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; we consider the download , ren@@ aming , re@@ pos@@ itory , ability to guarantee , re@@ act , waiting and export image files .

met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined according to your definition data , information on or a documentation of other data , which will be administ@@ rated by an application or surrounding area .
I feel at claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will definitely not know how many photos you will need to store both in a database than even in the image files , and a safe archiv@@ ing on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats free .
the first what you do and know before you have to adap@@ t some information structure in contrast to your system . your image files will have to save whether you want to store them on a reserv@@ ist &amp; etc ; consider that you must change sometimes on a larger image .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found in a year several times on the same place . if you get enough photos , you &apos;ll also use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then you can print a file for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing pictures , archives , working processes , constant supply of pictures are on different them@@ es and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % labour files and you will not want to organ@@ ise your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking @-@ processing simple . separate new from old files .
the separation of the original and working files , simp@@ lif@@ y a backup strategy and migration . they will always know if you are looking for a original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the options to activ@@ ate the met@@ ad@@ ata in the settings side of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . if you forget that ex@@ if@@ ications and IP@@ TC data can be stored in the file , then you can select the met@@ ad@@ ata out of the database into the files , select the appropriate point to the respective item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change that ? it is a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attri@@ butes . these are of course the most important ones .
now start the real work , since you should select any photo words , descriptions and an evaluation . of course you can select all images that need the same attri@@ bute and select the value . this makes sense where you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let us take a key@@ word , keywords , like you want to proceed with other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ on@@ ym@@ s for the same thing .
if you are catalog@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded words , then becomes &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; automatically add the images to the right place . the changes of the hier@@ archy is not a problem and can be easily accessible by using a under@@ way to another . the changed words are from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
the graph shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata shows . this is a very rough replica , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are all images .
enough of the words - the next section refers to descriptions or comments , the third important tools to catalog@@ us your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos to see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are certain to interest as your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach dress . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the landing area of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after the landing is again , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the lab@@ elling has been completely changed .
for other the photos of view is the title probably more important than the picture yourself to create a story . remember that the key is the meaning of viewer to help him to help Him about the motive that you don &apos;t understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if there are the strength only with a lab@@ elling for itself alone .
with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you can save a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alph@@ abet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , you can also export your testim@@ on@@ ies to your wishes to the lab@@ elling and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you must tell the story so for the opening times a second time .
do you remember the time before GPS ? when you had to find another town without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the beginning of the sp@@ ati@@ al presentation is now available with light speed .
the possibilities for ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ ation are already in@@ numer@@ able and become a pro@@ sper@@ ity . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travel with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures at the recording location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; using Google Maps Maps .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ rights is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of copyright to remove limit@@ ations above the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also applies in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description says that information on the out@@ skirts of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; as information is depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ on@@ ymous with plate and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photograph . if it was not desired to be changed , the name of the photographer or organization is not to be changed . this field is neither comm@@ as nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as part@@ itions .
aut@@ onomy ( syn@@ on@@ ymous with author ) : linked with the author . this field contains the working designation of the photographer . examples of the photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent photographer or independent photographer . as this is a ver@@ mer@@ k to the author , this field must be filled .
Editor ( Syn@@ onym for Contri@@ but@@ or ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld to identify the photo . if the photographer is listed here . if the picture is a ware@@ house , then the group / agency will offer the picture here .
it is very important the author and copyright sections , although this does not have any protection against ab@@ use . each of those who have a bit more than basic met@@ ad@@ ata , it can only be used in the image embedded met@@ ad@@ ata . for individuals , this is only for the majority of your photos only of low interest . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . in the near future , it will provide such a tool for st@@ acking processing .
topics : record errors , plate failure , ECC , transmission error , age@@ ing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ erv@@ or@@ ating , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ st@@ itions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs out on the road or a fire . this kind of losses might happen to you also at traditional paper photos or negative . in this section you can find problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data mining company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss .
in order to t@@ ack@@ le the problem with CDs / DVDs , you can &apos;t want to get more than a few years old . of course you can get more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the pieces of a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you think it is in your di@@ meas@@ ur@@ able room .
CD / DVD dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can easily reduce this risk in which you are good dis@@ ks and good recording equipment . the top DVD recording files are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it is so to choose the right .
CDs and DVDs are very inc@@ enti@@ ated for errors , even if you &apos;re just written only . 75 % of data are only effective data , the rema@@ inder are needed for the form@@ ulation and the check@@ s@@ men . despite this massive protection , they are using chemical aging , Ultra@@ violet light , cr@@ at@@ zer , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works with CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disk drives , hard drives , flash@@ media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray disc seem to store the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus has almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all of which CDs and DVDs was also valid for Blu @-@ ray Disk .
burn slowly with a good recording studio on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . Read all the media with a description , date &amp; author license and later on a clean , dark dry and before animals shel@@ tered the information on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece hardware or software that can read this media .
dis@@ si@@ ves keep your statistics for themselves . her manufacturer include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study about the error mechan@@ isms of hard drives : dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ers
shortly : dis@@ ks are running on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature , the frequencies are not established immediately . some of SM@@ ART is the most common fail@@ ures . these are especially readers and an old counter . the expected lifetime of life ranges between 4 and 5 years .
this is just around the complete loss of losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you may have backed data loss due to a power if you have backed up the files but these losses can normally be used without any major problems .
while most electrical devices electricity are not far off . these can take serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware mot@@ her@@ boards , dis@@ rup@@ ts mot@@ her@@ boards and other def@@ ects . protect themselves before the un@@ avoid@@ able that led to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against electricity tips is an over@@ load protection . this is a device that is absor@@ bed in the form of energy flas@@ hes and the rest is available usually in the form of a plug @-@ in strip . remember that not each coil strip also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you are searching for a over@@ load protection , then you should pay the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that he protects the protection against ligh@@ tening strikes .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be connected to your computer , you should also make sure all the periph@@ er@@ als and cable mod@@ ems can also include a telephone connection for your modem . other offers connectivity options for the co@@ axial cables of the cable mod@@ ems and the television card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ load protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ e@@ books and thus also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for the road .
while a over@@ voltage protection your system is based on smaller variations in the electricity lines . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of un@@ profit@@ able data . it can therefore be mean@@ ing@@ fully to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ voltage , these tools will be able to save your data . some models allow you to save your data . some models allow you to get the same quality requirements like a over@@ load protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your RE@@ CH@@ N@@ ER@@ SYSTEM can be exposed and compare its security in curr@@ ents with the cost to avoid this . a qualit@@ atively high quality over@@ load protection can be used for less than € ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you think . at the end you should always remember any cable before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as backup under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a secure target for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store data on data .
they are compared to the hard dis@@ ks , however , too expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data about compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general safety solution . therefore it is slowly .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yah@@ oo ) and the photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online storage services . your professional version provides you more available , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dram@@ atically . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed in reality .
from view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission error are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocols , and with the big companies included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ able .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transfer chain in the computer . all transfers are due to transfer errors . the file system needs to be used at least the data integr@@ ity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one has occurred when it happened in your hardware . all this dis@@ rup@@ tions remain incor@@ rec@@ t until you should have any protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought that it seems to be remember@@ ed . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more safe data way than that is in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source for transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ventions within the data flow . at normal file systems remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently un@@ affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , thousands of errors will be seen per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who are available with plate missing on lower level . it is open source , with many pat@@ ents and is available under one of the G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available for this article in English .
Or@@ acle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still using the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechan@@ isms that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the core .
this is not appreci@@ ated that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses in notebook and 46 % at work@@ station systems . with not@@ e@@ books already the proportion of the@@ ft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most chis@@ els . it is limited to a lower damage , e.g. the@@ ft or new installations . Apple users have known only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; there was no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less vul@@ ner@@ able for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to set the widespread fil@@ es@@ ystems . find a very good original article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and loss : false , only the speed of trial process during one operation is higher and a defined status is avo@@ ided . if however , a file is not fully stored before the problem happened , she is lost .
viruses are the largest threat to digital data : false , the@@ ft and human error are the main cause for data loss .
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 blocks of fundamental physical limits . community is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today cameras go in direction of 10 Meg@@ apixels . even if this resolution is already very high for compact cameras . even DSLR Cam@@ eras have a limit of 10 @-@ 12 megapixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full size sensor ( 24x@@ 36mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you are not responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are frequent in each year of a database and test this fuse before you &apos;re using any haz@@ ard@@ ous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of plates or the size of hard dis@@ ks .
supp@@ ose a day your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , light@@ ning strikes have you happ@@ ier if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster suggest@@ s loc@@ ally and destro@@ ys one amount . for@@ got an air@@ plane : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ie@@ ves are dangerous enough . they usually affect an entire room or the whole house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ erv@@ or@@ ality always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses to the steps into the neighbour@@ ing house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above as already said is a more common reason for a data loss in spite of secur@@ ing the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete secur@@ ing : a complete secur@@ ing all files are secured . it is a mom@@ ents of no history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete system . generates a complete mom@@ ents of two time points : the complete security and the last differenti@@ ation .
inc@@ ur@@ able backup : a backup of files have been changed since the last backup . several mom@@ ents have to restore any time . this fuse comes back to such a backup system with the exception that it is only ab@@ bed and not ongoing .
R@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily setup easily on your machines . in contrast to Sk@@ ri@@ pt @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scrip@@ ts , only the difference of files are really changed . this happens now and if you want to increase safety over ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another op@@ aque medium .
this approach will be enough time to discover losses and restore again . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly mom@@ ents for each month and a mom@@ ents for each month . any further development should be done manually , after you have a complete review .
topics : data stored IP@@ TC information , associated with X@@ MP files , original keeping , memory , scal@@ ability , media , can find pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment ... , use of the Internet .
with this valuable photos the next 40 year , it is about that time in you are really interested in you , because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ predic@@ table with cau@@ tion , you must consider everything that today is predicted with cau@@ tion . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain qu@@ alities . if less variations you have used in the past , so it &apos;s easier to evalu@@ ate the questions of the future .
this question is supposed to be addressed via the ex@@ plan@@ ations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for each . if you have an old system that it is important for reading your images , then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for a later usage .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : anyway , if you change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ uses technology , or your file format , you should review your library and needs to convert to a newer standard . keep in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialized pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means it always means .
let &apos;s go out of which you plan to have up the scal@@ ability with plant and partition . they don &apos;t want to copy on a dedicated plate or partition . * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transferred to a new sheet :
check out with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but they don &apos;t hang them .
s &amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / s@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; resi@@ dual FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ z@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary
open source standards have the major advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software anymore , you can read this yourself . this task will be easier for a year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format the slowly from the market . they should no longer use it .
PNG has been replaced as an open source standard as an open source standard . it can be lost , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transpar@@ ency . PNG can also use relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression . this format would like to recommend you to save your images .
TIFF was widely used as a picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression sal@@ ary algorith@@ m ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . this problem is that this format is adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw file format , it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is ob@@ li@@ ged to use the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera update is already available and we hope to use the compet@@ itors Canon and Nikon es sometimes any time .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe is introduced to replace the X@@ MP technology to replace the &apos; s &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . the file information will be supported with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers go before a original of your photo , mostly in the raw format , as it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file and the image file and how it is reasonable for the link between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ file and the image file . therefore , you should transl@@ ate whether you use DNG than containers and put everything there .
the Dublin Core met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that support a large area of influ@@ ences and business models . to the activities of DC@@ MI and the DC@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and ex@@ plan@@ atory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and intern@@ s .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the cam@@ eram@@ an are , you can use this as a temporary fuse .
convert raw files to DNG and save this in your shell pos@@ itory . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine , you can use external programs . if you want to add the images again with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut off to other programs .
Prot@@ ect the worked images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , enc@@ ode in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; in the section , you can find pictures you can already add to your hard disk , but you can already add many advanced settings for import@@ ing pictures to your Al@@ ben@@ dat@@ enb@@ ank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; connect this with the machine , switch the camera to the display mode and switch them . another description of you will find in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , this will start with your camera . if the connection is made , a heel indicator will be displayed on the lower end and the examples of all photos on the camera . some cameras do not appear , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for any file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera form@@ ations to each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of a entry or his met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information to be stored intern@@ ally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded from your computer . NOTE that in some digital cameras do not see all information available .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer not@@ ation , GPS etc . of the image . these information is the same as the met@@ ad@@ ata @-@ side panel from the main window of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; or the image processing . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata were not available with some digital cameras .
the eas@@ iest way to download photos on your computer , the click on the button to download and then the selection of all camera in a single album in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; . when downlo@@ ading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to download the pictures sure you can delete pictures from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the default selection by default . once you select the photos , use the button Download and then select button . the button chosen is available as long as you select some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is not available . these pictures have not yet been updated to you . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the case . if you choose this option , you will only download the new pictures .
if you are using the buttons on or Selected combination , a dialog appears where you can read the target album where you can read the target album as normal file , you can read in the section My albums . then select the target album out of the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and dig@@ ic@@ am ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can choose to remove them from the camera . if you want only delete a few , then you must select that first and then delete extinc@@ tion .
NOTE that there is no possibility to re@@ cover you from the camera you will be deleted from the camera . you should be carefully check if you want to remove them from the camera . if you want to er@@ ase it from the camera , you should make it much faster on the camera , as it is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ ename for the photos are often not appreci@@ ated . the fil@@ ename will be deleted . this may also be mean@@ ing@@ fully to integ@@ rate pictures , the date and time where the image has been done to integ@@ rate the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options to shooting and sp@@ elling holder . if you use this latter option , automatically stops a file per day .
the options on the transfer opens three more options that are carried out before the photos on the plate will be stored on the record standard . if you select that , the corresponding entries will be cop@@ ied from Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct a date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you wish to use another date format as the default format , you can add e.g. in the processing field of pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for further adjust@@ ments , you should read the help of command str@@ ing@@ time .
if you are using the camera file names , you have the opportunity to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters . or in large letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; for a photo is displayed below the name , which will be stored in the preview of the camera . their settings are stored for ren@@ aming and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time record . not all cameras put this information . in the section of page met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that set your camera into the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally enabled , and when your camera doesn &apos;t want this information , lets you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the button extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
when your camera is made available on the date , you can read &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; this sub@@ albums are based on the picture sequence . all images will be downloaded on the same date . not all cameras provide this information on the same date . in the section side panel Met@@ a data you can read , which would have embedded information your camera into the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in that case you want to change this option directly in the finish album . if you want to change this option , you need to select this option on the lower end of the window at the bottom end of the window .
the eas@@ iest way photos from its calcul@@ ator to your camera is the button Download . then select upload . select the file choice dialog &amp; k@@ de ; if you can select the files that you can be up@@ loaded , you can also choose to select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is read , asks you , where the pictures should be loaded up . a file selection dialog appears . choose the desired folder , press OK to start the upload . the pictures are not er@@ ased out of your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , it is a position that can be displayed in length and latitude . the determination of data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LON@@ AS , to the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photography , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geograph@@ ical place . not everyone uses a plane to cardi@@ ov@@ ate GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural bure@@ ros and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can send a postcard to another &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; user you want to loc@@ ate the location of the photos , or just write this aspect document , it &apos;s good the position data of a photos .
the question is , how are the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that the data comes into this fields ? there are at least three ways to reach these fields . directly with the correct hardware , via a successor of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geograph@@ ical correspondence ( manual ) , and last about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is no camera which has a GPS unit integrated . but there are some that work with GPS receiver . either as map module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR R@@ ico@@ h Pro G3
the download of GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save these data in g@@ px format , since this is the only format to be supported by the module to Ge@@ ographic Pro@@ cedure .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data from pictures and from GPS extrac@@ ting and cor@@ related . on the following page you can see the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude , you can use this script that can be used with the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it is used for example of map@@ s.@@ google .

the settings of the lumin@@ ance from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; can be set on this page on the default values . anyway , some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; in the whole picture pack . if you have one , then you can obtain better impact results .
by default , the image processing has a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different colour , you can select that here . you can use the tool@@ bar switch off when you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposure areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker and bright color in the picture . these colors are fixed here . in the image processing , this sigh@@ t@@ ation can be used with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chrom@@ a sub@@ sampling is meant that the pictures are coded in higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the Far@@ bin@@ form@@ ations . please read this article by Wikipedia to this article .
with the setup of PNG files , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this surgery is not reduced the image quality , as PNG have a los@@ s@@ less algorith@@ m . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
using the TIFF files , you can convert the De@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compression algorith@@ m for TIFF images . this is reduced the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ates -@@ Alg@@ orith@@ m has worked out free .
with the setting los@@ s@@ free JPEG 2000 files you can choose any loss . even if you have written down the loss between quality loss and file size far better than to normal JPEG . when this unit was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the image processing is just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to create a tool for man@@ ip@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal in sensitive on ul@@ tra@@ violet light when the pixels are using this problem with minimal loss of details . this option dra@@ ws this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option dra@@ ws the picture a bit soft , but elim@@ inated the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ 3G or the AHD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is it a fixed colour balance sheet , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card which was photograph@@ ed on a white map .
this setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option will be ig@@ no@@ red .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your camera will be burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera to consider as through the in@@ ability of your camera . the setting is produced some unusual results , because they are trying to re@@ construc@@ t some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible , since blue pixels are not so fast as fast as green and red . &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; and dc@@ raw are the missing green and red @-@ shares of the still not saturated blue pixel . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option to re@@ construc@@ t your option , you get the possibility to set a level . this is a value of three com@@ promise and can therefore be adjusted for each image .
put the Lumin@@ esc@@ ence to your taste . you must probably be somewhat higher than the default 1 . this may also be done later in the image options of the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing . in order to get the time for the demo server , you should be careful !
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ ison -@@ Alg@@ orith@@ m is a digital image process to get a complete image from the section image sensor that presents many cameras , and which indicates a matrix color pixel . this algorith@@ m is known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour design .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; and thanks to some of these altern@@ atives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and AHD interface . after some tests there was created . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorith@@ m created by D@@ c@@ raw . however , it is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result .
if you know the de@@ viation of your l@@ ent@@ ils , you can set the red and blue coral value here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you have been carried out during the Roh@@ Converter .
an profile transl@@ ates the Far@@ bin@@ form@@ ations and gives instructions such as this again . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; information like the Far@@ bin@@ form@@ ations of a color space in the other are so exactly as possible .

self @-@ profile file S@@ itting here the folder , e.g. / usr / share / color / ICC / / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all your profiles . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; if it exam@@ ines the folder then during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles , you have the opportunity &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can change in open the raw file later .
the colour @-@ administ@@ ered view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or arg@@ yl@@ l . here , only your pictures are not man@@ ages the entire screen .
the input profiles should be custom@@ ized . not all profiles are made on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which contain any colour ton@@ m@@ apping or Gam@@ ma@@ correct correction . this means that you have to conduct the color m@@ apping itself .
there are further options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate it . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated , rather than to rely on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite ob@@ vious that colour profile for them is intended . unfortunately , it is not compatible with the models of Canon . therefore , here you can fit a table of cameras and profiles . this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion can recogn@@ ise the style : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Port and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in interface . it is a interface that supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; imag@@ ination and image processing is supported . many modules support which have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of the available modules . choose which you want to use &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; however , these modules will be released as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu .
brief inter@@ section for tasks , which are carried out by modules , can be set up in the menu below settings .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper shelf is adjusted between the images , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes on the met@@ ad@@ ata , or off , which ends at the lower end of the pictures during the display .
the camera properties show a list of all at the left . on the right side there is a button Automatic recognition , which is connected to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . you are to use the camera settings . currently , the port settings are currently serial , USB@@ - and USB / FireWire @-@ mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re- ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage camera . this field is only active when you have a USB@@ - or FireWire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera , or / m@@ nt /
to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you have to connect the camera to your computer , put it into the display mode and switch off .
try out of whether &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set the camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any of any designation for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option of actu@@ ation dialog for the shi@@ fting of &gt; pictures in the gar@@ bage burning , you can set the talk of a photos in an album . in the sn@@ ap of a photos and del@@ eting of a album you will find another details .
the edit@@ orial changes caused by the right side bar can be shut down welding using &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; if you want to use the option changes in the right side bar without any feedback . otherwise you need to use the changes with the button changes .
you can also contact the introduction of the welcome screens from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; while the start of the start . this acceler@@ ates the start from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
the setting up to new photos are looking for looking for new photos &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; the base time after new or deleted albums . this extends the start @-@ time from &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . if something from the base plan was deleted , you will ask whether it should delete it out of the database .
various colour sch@@ em@@ as can be used in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings you can choose from the tool@@ bar design . a preview of available designs will be shown below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested , a new design for &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these view to see your photos and create a click with the left mouse button to the preview of a picture or by the Con@@ text menu of the preview and selection of view details / edit started .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; for example , they are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file number , enlar@@ gement factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the upper edge and ben@@ e@@ ath the tool bar to fast access to the most common functions .
the processing functions of image processing changes your photos . however , the features will change the original photo , before you can use the Save or the button Save out of the tool bar . NOTE that you can &apos;t restore the original photo , once you have the image saved .
so you should be ev@@ tl . copy a copy of your picture before you change it . it can carry out a file with the store .
as long as you have not stored the photo , you can use the original image , using the menu file , re@@ produce image processing in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change that you have conducted at the photo since the last store .
almost any promotion of image processing cannot be done or restored . the last action can be reset , re@@ loc@@ ally re@@ gre@@ ts or re@@ produced by using editing .
if you use this often , you should make the keyboard short@@ est , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ z to reset and Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re@@ produce .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB , on the re@@ plac@@ ard or restore button in the tool bar a moment longer , you will receive a Con@@ text menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are made between also back and restored .
once you move the image processing , you can move between the photos of the same album or the same key@@ word , you can use the navigation use in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture below or entries in the menu file . if you have any changes on the current photo , you are asked whether you want to back up this page .
you can see in the photo , and zo@@ oming in the Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the use menu .
in order to adjust the window size , you can use this knob in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor
view Full Screen Saver displays the picture in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the tool@@ bar code . if you don &apos;t want to see this in the settings dialog by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; change it from the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; main window will see the section to set the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the menu file , you can print the default and k@@ le ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or entire movements . all picture pages can select from your selection . you must select only the images with the default methods and select printing assistant . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice only .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; main window has a page bar at right edge , the important information and actions for the selected pictures are available , without the navigation file , also available in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five ri@@ ders is cli@@ cked :
multiple cli@@ cking on the same rider can be appe@@ aring back into the edge or dis@@ appear in the edge .
in the lab@@ elling view you can enter sign@@ ings with unlimited size . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the lab@@ elling will be cop@@ ied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data files are only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are removed after 2000 characters and are formed by other characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC let@@ tering field in other applications , you should note these restri@@ ctions .
after having comm@@ ented it , you can use either the button or switch to the next image , the lab@@ elling will then stored .
besides the application button there is a button . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata out of the selected file or the database . but this is always done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata adjustment which is always written into the pictures .
the evaluation review shows an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the page mode is always applied to the same image . to rate multiple pictures at the same time , select these from and use the Con@@ text menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field urg@@ ency . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word depic@@ ts a search box for the fil@@ tering of the words , the sample tree and a selection box with previously appeared in this &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; -@@ session end@@ owed j@@ acks .
the key@@ tree lo@@ om will be adjusted in accordance with the given search phr@@ ase . you can quickly use the number of possibilities in search for a key@@ word quickly , this ability is especially useful if you have many words .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief during the input of j@@ lit@@ ters in a picture series . if you have different words , these are stored for quick access .
key@@ words may also be set through mark@@ ings of the appropriate check boxes in tree . all keywords are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple pictures are selected in the main view and you can select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the entire selection , if you want to read a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the side panel j@@ ig@@ t@@ filter is used to change the selection of the main window frames with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and Se@@ arch@@ ies . if additionally , one or multiple sample filters out of the right side will only be displayed . all produced words are available .
you may also accept connections and place . supp@@ ose you have chosen several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can simply ask it out of the right side panel and put on a dialog if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a c@@ alender date . the key@@ word filter is chosen to no sample words . they were taken with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards it was taken a key@@ word from the right hand tree to the selection , and that this key@@ word should be given .
these search for changes takes place at any start of the program . you can also be switched on different versions .
if you have a rule with and created and establish it , it can be one or his own , you can easily change this easily with a double @-@ click on the text and control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which is wanted in the database . this is an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the Oper@@ ator , which is a name or a string , which is already written in the database .
for example , you can find a extended search about all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to match cho@@ ices , you need only check the check box at the end of the rule and then follow the button . the options then look like this :

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mostly adapted to &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why to create a color@@ ful work@@ flow , you can reach the colors from your camera or scanners , you can achieve that colours on your monitor or scanners , you can print the colors on your monitor or to print the colors on your monitor or on the web of your digital night@@ chamber .
if the topic is based on color administration , then you want to press what buttons needs to provide for the results of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide sufficient background information about colour management . in addition , links with a de@@ eper information allow you to make your own information decisions to make your desired outcome .
if your image work@@ flow performed all six below , then you need to take care of colour management .
they work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( more information see below )
your only other aspect ratio is by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if s@@ RGB is doing so well , and life for all so easy , why you should use another colour space so that thoughts about paint administ@@ ered ng ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB compared to the colors which we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional rep@@ orter of all colors which we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ical region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ently and click on information and then on information About RGB Working spaces .
do I have to fix my monitor , if I decided to work on my RGB color space only ?
Yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to monitor your monitor . if you &apos;re using your monitor , so you need to use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , you must use either your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve the picture in most cases . use it before you try to try a further manual processing .
the functions can norm@@ alize the same , automatic and contrast from the menu correc@@ ting automatic correction automatically out of your colors . they will need to experim@@ ent with these effects , to see what the best at your photo .
normal@@ izes : this method scal@@ able the light output values above the whole image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is so bright as possible without any colour sh@@ aded . this function is often an gast@@ ronom@@ ic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
the same method : this method is adjusted the ligh@@ ten@@ tion factor in the colors of selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channels are even so flat as possible . this means a very good results in the improvement of the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either mir@@ acle with a picture or it destroyed it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . the dark and bright border sh@@ ades and adjusted the red , green and blue channels in the entire hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improved the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of RGB values of a picture by the post@@ p@@ est and highest levels of all values . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to complete the white balance of a photos .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted to an colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can occur too far from the original image , if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which can operate in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorith@@ m of ur@@ rec@@ tly leg@@ ally protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start on the menu entry colors white balance of the image processing .
the window can be adapted to the size . on the left side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target box . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the lower window .
the preview of the target company has a red mark@@ ers . the lumin@@ ance of the pi@@ anist with this mark@@ ers is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above is a hist@@ ogram , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small Lumin@@ esc@@ ence . with one button you decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be called .
the contrast of your result was hang@@ ed by shadow , satur@@ ation and Gamma . the shadow of justice will improve your favorite details or down also down .
att@@ ach to the above controls , you should use the colour temperature pipette . push on this button and then somewhere on the image preview for calcul@@ ating the colour temperature to the white balance . this type will also be automatically set to the temperature and green values .
additionally , you can set the white balance with the list of the default settings . the following settings are available :
the co@@ at@@ lo@@ co@@ ator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the Pi@@ o- trans@@ formers .. you will get the combined result in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure Indi@@ c@@ ator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and store do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you can store it into a text file and later again .
the knob pres@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and corresponding neutral white balance . NOTE that even neutral settings will see another picture as your original . if you save this store your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding control per colour channel of the processed image format . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited to high quality images . however , this coding requires even more disk space , comp@@ uting time and stands for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of tubes . it uses the change and assignment of color profile . colour ton@@ m@@ apping can be performed by the window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for use of paint profiles , you can move the chapter colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu below colors pick@@ up . this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same correction . in the manual for audio @-@ correction you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for grad@@ ation that you will find in the menu on the menu .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; Tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ections provides you four colour effects , a solar energy effect , an Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and a Can@@ oe filter .
in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the image has been developed , and then the development of the image has been inver@@ ted . the result was a partially negative inside of image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
intensity controls the solar control . at about 50 % intensity shows the image which is electro@@ less possible . an additional increase creates a negative image that is not usable on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the standardi@@ zation ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Effect . he diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation effect , it is brilliant , brilliant . try it easy to make a lot of photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name to be created by the Japanese company Fuj@@ if@@ ilm . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ire ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly have a choice for natural photo@@ graph@@ s . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly which are also some Photo@@ graph@@ ers , especially to whom the sc@@ arc@@ ely scen@@ eries are too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast of the contrast . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the neo @-@ light . at large pictures , the filter can add the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual that you want to experim@@ ent the colour tap@@ ing and the lamp in the menu below colours . all your justice will be satisfied with the result . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you have a photo in bad light conditions , you can get a good choice for brightness / satur@@ ation of satur@@ ation . all changes you can perform in the preview . if it &apos;s the result you can confirm the changes with o@@ k .
between the complex tool Grad@@ ation and the simple Leu@@ k@@ strength / Contr@@ ast / Gamma is the tool sound correction for impro@@ ving the exposure . even if the dialog appears to this tool very comp@@ lic@@ ated , you will need for the range of shooting purposes only the range of sli@@ der . concrete the three shooting below the hist@@ ogram .
the window includes an application of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , of active can@@ als or the selected area . under the graphic , three shooting in the picture are exposed to change the intensity values . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the eas@@ iest way to learn the operation is to move to the control , and change it to the image as the image changes .
on the right side , the original and the preview of the picture will be viewed . the preview is dynamic , updated from the picture of the picture . on the left hand , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this evaluation box can be displayed if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mix Y @-@ axis is often used . for pictures of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic initi@@ ation is useful .
three regulator : the top of the dark sounds , the middle of the bright sounds , the middle of the sh@@ ades , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three colors pet@@ ed can be used in the preview of the original image , to adjust the input values of the sh@@ adows , medium and bright sounds . moreover , there is a knob for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values can be used to change the selection values for each area . there are also two controllers can be used to change the output values such as the input values can be used as a background for something else in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically exp@@ andable depending on the intensity values .
save as and store : with this buttons , set the set values in the file system and re@@ loaded later again . in addition to this , the Gim@@ p levels is used .
if you are using these mode and the three color pip@@ et , the input values automatically adjusted for all shade , medium and sol@@ arium will be re @-@ adjusted , and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram , green , blue and the lumin@@ esc@@ ens .
the option transfer inde@@ xed indicators will display all colour channels to display over@@ loaded pixels , and this combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect on the preview only and there is no effect at the final result .
below , you can see an example of the align@@ ment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha canal , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the origin@@ als and the target image is indicated . the preview can be viewed in dependence by your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fied channel : these evaluation box allows the channel to specify the channel from the module :
in addition to this box , two ic@@ ons are to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mix view . most of the linear mode of a constant color , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a cur@@ ator after right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds can be correspon@@ dent and correspon@@ d to the associated image pixel dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marked on the curve . if you want to change this mark on the curve , you will create a right line on this line and move the value on this line and move the value to your taste , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and store : with this buttons , you can do exactly this . every turn you can replace with this file system and later , the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you set this method and the three color pip@@ et buttons , the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sol@@ arium . activ@@ ate the color , you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option transfer Indi@@ c@@ ator will display all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than a channel over@@ loaded pixels , you will receive the combined result . this is a preview only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white picture which has been correc@@ ted in the lumin@@ ary . Sh@@ adows and sol@@ arium was set with the col@@ li@@ ons and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing is a tool to enh@@ ance the color channels or to change the sh@@ aded photos of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can process it from the menu @-@ channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can see the relative distribution and calculation . the left area of the window shows you a preview of the window . the original can be viewed to compare over the own rider .
the preview of the target range has a red mark@@ ers . if you set this in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to display the respective user value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allows you to activ@@ ate this channels when you enable the corresponding paint component . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the option of great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white port@@ raits .
sometimes , especially when you choose Monochrome , reducing the reduction of a color to a visible space that comes from the same place in color channel and whose space is different from any channel . if the case is , you can improve your Monochrome converting to improve the far@@ ming .
the store as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any popular mixer setting can store you for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option transfer inde@@ xed indicators will display all colour channels to display over@@ loaded pixels , and this combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect on the preview only and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted . this option is activated . the original image is activated ( 1 ) and this image has been shown below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your Abst@@ rac@@ tion . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , as color pictures can easily be converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film transfer with a green left filter . this looks good for port@@ raits against the sky . thus , like the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ver@@ ter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film photography with an orange lens filters . this impro@@ ves landscapes , marit@@ ime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ filmed .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film transfer with a red lens filters . this creates dram@@ atic vision @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate Mond@@ li@@ cea to daylight . thus similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film transfer with a yellow lens filters . this is the most natural color correction and impro@@ ves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : this creates hot bright and medium tones while he adds a bit cold in the sad@@ dles of a pressure and recovery in a sep@@ tic acid . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ ia .
using &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool tex@@ ture , you can contact decorative tex@@ tures on an image .
through the adding a tex@@ ture to your picture , ir@@ respective whether it is a colour image or not , you can look like a oil painting on a wall@@ paper , a pop style portrait of enlar@@ ging points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry picture tex@@ ture can be used for the image processing .
relief : floating this parameter to the right increases the level of depth and three dimensional tex@@ ture of tex@@ ture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ tured is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed to ( 2 ) . the parameters of relief is set to 200 .
adding a decorative frame can be added with the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool bar can be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is no easy task . to keep his attention to keep the image of a decorative frame . this is a psych@@ ological barrier to the stre@@ aming eye . adding the module from the image processing .
type : with this parameter set the desired type of box for your picture . through an dil@@ ute line and wide range ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , the ideal frame is ideal for a button extension and decor@@ atively added a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specif@@ ies the width of the frame in percent . the value range is limited by 1 % to 50 % .
that with the frame @-@ decorated target image is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially when you have used the tool to add the aspect ratio before .
with this practical tool , you can easily add a @-@ format text into a picture of any spot . this is also on several locations if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply use the text and place it with the mouse . use text , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set of the picture size . for the end , you can simply choose a frame around the text and / or a half transparent background . the picture is finished .
any setting , which you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you have entered the button &quot; OK . after the image once was saved , the text is part of the image . he cannot be changed anymore .
with the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool st@@ encil , you can place a st@@ encil about an image .
the menu image st@@ encil to be used in the image processing , to place an image on a picture .
for the st@@ encil , there is no restri@@ ctions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to add the PNG file format and should you want to add a e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; mail@@ ing@@ list dig@@ ik@@ am @-@ Us@@ ers @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you are using this tool for the first time you need to put your st@@ encil file with the button base files in the dialog . select the file into the st@@ encil files . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root ord@@ ner set out for the tem@@ plates which refle@@ cts the Ord@@ n@@ erst@@ ation of the st@@ encil manager . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
under the preview you are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ged the following picture . it is cent@@ red around the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
cr@@ ises : this knob resi@@ zed down below . it will be cent@@ ered to the position of the mouse . if you want to use the mouse on the whole image , you have to ver@@ ify the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this button to move below the template below . take the picture and put it to the desired position .
use OK if you want to address the st@@ encil to your image . the picture is then adapted to the template size .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; presents three different tools to sharp@@ ens . each of you have pre@@ ferences in other areas .
sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it &apos;s very fast and simple , but generates especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
un@@ sharpen@@ ed mask works on the contrast of the edges . actually , it is not a bit really psych@@ ov@@ is@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric Dun@@ es and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gim@@ p and is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three , because he really improve the sharp@@ ness . it is a little comp@@ lic@@ ated in its use and has various parameters to adap@@ t .
photos without focus and most digit@@ alised pictures need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is the same phenom@@ enon to be applied to a common color . this is the same phenom@@ enon to be printed when colour points are printed on paper . SLR cameras need more than normal levels as normal cameras for privacy .
at JPEG images a camera is widely applied in internal sharp@@ ening . pictures in the raw format , we must always have to be used throughout processing .
some scanner apply a sharp@@ ness filter already during the picture of the picture . when you activ@@ ate this de@@ activ@@ ate , check control over your image .
in some situations you can obtain necessary results by using a photo using sharp@@ ening material removal . you can call with the menu entry .
they should be careful when the results are not very natural look : sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but increasingly also the noise . in general , you will reach it over the menu entry . you will reach more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ens .
sometimes you have the opposite results : a picture is a bit soft . the solution to draw a bit soft . use the tool to the sof@@ ten@@ er and experim@@ ent with the menu entry and experim@@ enting something with the settings . the advance on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter de@@ compos@@ ite is a very good tool to remove grinding of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help the image . the fil@@ ament shows the issue of the screen with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results and should increase the effect . if you make the skin mask too strongly , smoking and the impression of gre@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius represents a lot of pixel screen on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ os . you should therefore sharp@@ ens pictures at the best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the respect image which is added to the original . this will set the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the threshold value is a fr@@ action of the maximum RGB values and to apply difference . it can therefore be defined for a lower difference between the pots of sharp@@ ness , except therefore Schön@@ ness error in fac@@ ial , Himm@@ ler and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this image has been used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ am ; tool re@@ foc@@ uses on impro@@ ves a picture through impro@@ ving the sharp@@ ness . it used to ass@@ ess@@ ly protected the copyright fil@@ let filters -@@ Alg@@ orith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to navig@@ ate a picture to &amp; quot ; in which it &apos;s a better approach to sharp@@ ens . this is using a tool named FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the use of a sharp mask . re@@ focus will usually reach better results as un@@ sharp . you can start colors from the menu by using colors re@@ focus on the image processing .
in practice , the circular saw is much better than the pal@@ let &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche folding has a very long tail , depending on the source code , which is far away from the original cross and so far , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; is influ@@ enced in most cases , even very strongly influ@@ enced by the dist@@ ant pixels . the un@@ wanted results are caused un@@ wanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameters for the use of this module . it is the most important parameters for the use of this module . you can set a higher value if your picture is very un@@ sharp , but then you should pay attention to sanctuary .
cor@@ relation : enh@@ ancing cor@@ relation can help reduce ar@@ isation . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values are close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation is reduced to the visual effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of noise filter can help you reduce ar@@ effici@@ ents . however , values above 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter can be too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.03 . a high value is even more contam@@ ination .
Gau@@ ß &apos; sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos; s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ ci@@ ous filter is caused . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 , so you might need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determin@@ es the size of trans@@ form@@ at@@ rix . if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; . however , the module is very slowly when you choose large values for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value of 3 @-@ 10 .
the store as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any popular reproduction parameters will be stored for later and can be loaded later .
try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before use the module .
otherwise you should use the module , before you change the image on the other hand . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately , but later they leave un@@ pleasant art@@ e@@ facts .
if you can read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
General Produc@@ es un@@ sch@@ emes m@@ asked better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be caused by reason a greater neighborhood use as sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ ti@@ cally it must always produce ar@@ cer@@ pts . even under optimal conditions it can never make the effect of the un@@ parall@@ eled filter . practi@@ cally it is the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least the same as the un@@ parall@@ eled mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better for processing of small details .
at the bottom , you can watch a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be correc@@ ted . this image has been made with an analog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for further information on the methods of the respon@@ ses in digital bil@@ ites you can read technical data in English under this address .
the regulator Gl@@ ory is set out the sharp edge of the surface , to generate a natural p@@ up@@ lighter .
the colour ink allows a adapted color to the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts .
the algorith@@ m was developed by the IMAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool provides several counts as Star@@ points to simp@@ lif@@ y the restoration . the available settings are shown below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
details p@@ onder@@ ing &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preserv@@ ation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass . a value of 0.9 should be details so that no sharp@@ ness is required . please note that the details should always be subject to the guid@@ ing dependent .
basic effic@@ acy of alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smo@@ oth@@ ed in all directions , while a value is very similar to 1 in one direction . if you have a film paper or CCD noise , a very high value of similar pattern generate . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ e@@ te will be elim@@ inated at a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this set the maximum smo@@ othing factor via all@@ es@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regular control signal : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher of this value is necessary , the more will be smo@@ oth@@ ed when it &apos;s hard to estimate the geomet@@ ry of image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ance effect , he must be higher than 3 .
rep@@ et@@ itions : specif@@ ies how often the algorith@@ m run through . usually this is 1 or 2 .
angle grad@@ as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is selected , it should also be chosen . NOTE that small angles should generate a long run@@ time . you should make this value as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integration width increments &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ able stri@@ de width in pixels . you should avoid small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never be larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the quality will use the quality which you will receive by sel@@ ecting this option is only small . but it doubled the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him to allow it .
the buttons are mir@@ rors and load this . every setting of image errors can be stored here in a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
image errors can be compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob break@@ through .
below you can see as picture error with small art@@ e@@ facts . the module is applied to a photo that is created in Guatemala City with an an@@ alo@@ t camera in the fore@@ ground that caused by a poor film during the journey to see and the original image is under ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ am ; rough@@ beam is a very powerful tool to reduce Bil@@ dr@@ au@@ schen . it uses an ur@@ isp@@ ens@@ able algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selected educational filter to remove spots and other art@@ e@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair in the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ ac@@ ute ; -@@ effects from imported images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this tut@@ orial in this tut@@ orial in this tut@@ orial .
the screen photo shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you will need only the window details and the window @-@ window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , of 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can be used through the radius of the range through the image and the color in it is smo@@ oth@@ ed and with the smaller errors .
focus : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value requires the pixel pitch of the filters according to the front . if the value is too high , if you need to change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can &apos;t get more and noise and sm@@ ell again .
Kan@@ ten : controls the edge accuracy of the filter . if it is too strongly , the frequency response can be removed or smo@@ other points . set him on a value near the Maxim@@ us if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ e@@ facts .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ escent sample of the picture . we recommend you either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve your image . these settings are not subject to the smo@@ othing process by the details settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of picture . we recommend you either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve your image . these settings are not subject to the smo@@ othing process by the details settings .
gamma : controls the gamma value of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas which are typically stronger . it does not poll@@ uted the atten@@ ds .
d@@ amping : controls the align@@ ment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing . this value defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius at variations of the lumin@@ ance if it is too high , can occur if it can occur at his minimum , smoking and ph@@ az@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur at edges . it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for this .
save and store : these buttons are using exactly this . all parameters used for noise , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later on .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with the default settings .
sometimes a picture of a cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . to draw a bit more simple than a picture . use tool to sof@@ tly and experim@@ ent with the menu entry and experim@@ enting with the glass . the advance on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools developed by photo@@ graphic file .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted art@@ e@@ facts from your pictures . it is very good adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos; sch@@ es , film paper , cr@@ at@@ zer , compression art@@ is@@ ies , and later digit@@ alised digit@@ alised images . the smo@@ othing takes place along the image con@@ tours and gets the content as it makes the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and text for@@ cement , the text message is carried out with another tool , the aspect ratio was developed by the IMAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should be correct .
the buttons are mir@@ rors and load this . every setting of photo @-@ restoration may be stored here in a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can reduce as a photo with equ@@ ili@@ ent noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ ori@@ ous film pieces on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time , Tex@@ tures can be read on an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the Scan Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te from the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ia paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ am ; tool Hot@@ pixel are allowed to remove hot pixels from photos using a CCD camera , eight were using Alg@@ orith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression comes on a built @-@ in subst@@ itute for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark sub@@ trac@@ tion method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
Download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will recogn@@ ise automatic hot and bright pixels . these are high@@ ligh@@ ted in the image show .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to record the dark image directly to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the correct picture . please note that the assistant to be the last dark image , and this will automatically return to the next meeting .
the image area and the preview can help you in the image the result . the case shows the issue of the film with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all sizes .
choose an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the Fil@@ ters . then choose the best filter to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
thir@@ ds : it will be an average of the neighbor@@ ho@@ ist pixel . it is assigned to all def@@ ects in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels at a distance of 1 from the pixel block , are pul@@ led to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Linear Cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel inside block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block will be reduced to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pul@@ led to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel inside block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and longer exposure , applied . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; Vign@@ es@@ tier@@ ing Cor@@ rection is a tool to be correc@@ ted , i.e. , te@@ alight corners , one image .
wide angle lens , especially the middle and large photo format , can be often exposed to the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of image by remov@@ ing the light to the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ Obj@@ ectives have also shown this behavior .
but it also does draw@@ back@@ s . many Center filter need a factor of 1.5 or 2 while sh@@ utter filters , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be able to use with Center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ profit@@ able effects will arise .
with the large coating areas of today &apos;s Fil@@ men@@ tions and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by an aci@@ dic transformation of a raw material that is made without these filters . the scope of use with a Center@@ filter is being protected against an image . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vign@@ et@@ ting Cor@@ rection Filter and with three further the exposure of the target body .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light effect at the point of the largest density of filters . the standard density is 2,0 , resulting in a optical filter with an aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly an optical strength of 2 , kid@@ neys , reduce the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vign@@ es@@ entation , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degrees .
leu@@ k@@ ness , Contr@@ ast and Gamma settings : the processing of a picture with the Vign@@ et@@ isation layer reduces the LEDs of pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target data with these options , because you have to increase the settings only .
if you want to use a host@@ ile of exposure to the target of target , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma on zero and use the grad@@ ation from the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing from the menu .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the desired picture in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ ted picture . a lamp diff@@ use and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ ics ; lin@@ king @-@ dist@@ or@@ tion is a tool to correc@@ ted the effect of spher@@ ical l@@ ent@@ ils on photos . it uses an ur@@ isp@@ ens@@ able algorith@@ m by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric or@@ tion . colour dist@@ or@@ tion can &apos;t be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the second degree is treated with the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion of lens and can conc@@ ave the conc@@ ave or conv@@ ex shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third gr@@ ades has a similar way @-@ effects , but fl@@ atten@@ ed into the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth gr@@ ades correc@@ ts the dist@@ ant corners opposite the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric or@@ tion can be elim@@ inated almost elim@@ inated .
General : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion second Gr@@ ades . with negative values , t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical orn@@ ings can be correc@@ ted and positive values of k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic dist@@ or@@ tion .
corner : this value controlled the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion fourth gr@@ ades . this value increases stronger than the edges than in the center of picture . for most l@@ ent@@ ils the &apos; corners parameters of the parameter of the parameter is generally used .
Zoom : this value scale the picture shows the image size and leads to an Cor@@ rection first size . negative values are en@@ large while positive the picture .
up@@ heav@@ al : this value adjusted the brightness into the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values it increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated by the dialogue with a preview of the dist@@ or@@ tion Cor@@ rection . the values you are using for your image , stored in the next start as default values .
t@@ onn@@ es@@ - or k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic correction should be carried out prior to all add@@ itives or size changes . best you have to cut this correction as all first . if you have a picture to cut and after that a t@@ onn@@ al correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ se .
to help you find the best correction to show you this tool for vertical and a horizontal relief line . move the mouse po@@ inter to fix the lines on this site , and press the left mouse button around the lines at this point . in the connection you can correct t@@ onn@@ es@@ - / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic dist@@ or@@ tion with the help of lines .
if you correc@@ ted a k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic dist@@ or@@ tion , the resulting image has black corners . you can remove these dialog boxes using the image processing or via Zoom Reg@@ ulator this dialog .
for most pictures , the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction from the front , frame and paintings are the perspective such as frame , frame and paintings . notice that if you keep the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ or@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and this correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website , which produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this UR@@ L . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters , film paper and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to adjust film paper and film sensitivity . the ISO regulator is changed the amount of film pieces and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ oph@@ yl@@ l in nature ) in the conversion . green me@@ adows are white as snow !
since the filters can be mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make any sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the Far@@ bin@@ form@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ let on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and this worked image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type A@@ ura in the top lights .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter film gritt is an easy to use film screen@@ shots like e.g. B / W Ko@@ dak Tri @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films to increase the manufacturer large silver gra@@ ins of the photo@@ emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ iny impact gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . if you want to see this special , gallery arti@@ gen , rhin@@ estones , gra@@ iny view especially to your mon@@ och@@ rom@@ ms photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control of the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the bas@@ k@@ age . the default value is , although often higher values are required to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film gra@@ iny impact on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil paintings . it uses an ur@@ isp@@ ens@@ able algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ am ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil paintings . nature photos and styles are good for these effect .
there are two shelves to influence these effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five out . thick@@ er brush is better for large pictures . smooth , the glucose or , from the other side is considered to be hin@@ der .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and this is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Gl@@ ory 17 .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon dioxide . this is not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen you to catch him .
there are two shelves with a value range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regulator sel@@ ects the sticks size and the lower is adjusted to the contrast ( smo@@ kes ) .
this is an example of the coal direc@@ tories . the original image ( 1 ) and the amended picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved due to adap@@ ting the intensity .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter engraving the picture in 3 @-@ D , when it was marked in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works especially the most important content in pictures . the filter uses differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ling landscape .
depth allows to set the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , the default setting is set .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the image used image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an art@@ work with dist@@ or@@ tion effects . it uses ur@@ rec@@ tly protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
oil blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image in the cells and makes it look like if it appears through glass blocks .
Wave blocks 2 : analogue to the wav@@ y blocks 1 is dist@@ orted the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can canc@@ el these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an art@@ work with accid@@ ent@@ ity effects . it uses ur@@ rec@@ tly protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom Fol@@ lowing : compar@@ ing the picture along a glob@@ ular lines that go out of a center . this sim@@ ulates the imp@@ lications a zo@@ om@@ ed camera , thus produces a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ ale notes : linked the image by turning the pixel to a center . this sim@@ ulates the imp@@ lications of a turning camera .
distance prob@@ ation : do the image to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera system . the object seems back to the background .
movement of movement : linked the picture by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the imp@@ lies of a bit moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
wheat gra@@ ins : wi@@ ped the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this is ideal for creating the romantic port@@ raits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and sub@@ tle hot .
Schütt@@ el@@ sharpen@@ ed : linked the picture through random translation of pixel and sim@@ ulates the imp@@ lications of an ar@@ bit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
Intelligent Spec@@ if@@ ers : finds the Far@@ ms in the image and know this without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and created it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice small tool to make Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps on your image . this makes it possible to make your pictures a n@@ great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ ber@@ ally protected algorith@@ m .
tropical size allowed it to change the size of the dri@@ p size . since the dri@@ p size does not need to decrease the size for small pictures . number of drops and density of drops . fish changes to the optical effect of drop in the picture .
you can keep using &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . use the selection tool to select the range , e.g. a face that will be freely re@@ commen@@ ce . if you re@@ boot the filter , the range is free from ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps .
this is an example of the knob Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the picture is the wrong orientation , you can bring it by sp@@ elling or turning into the right orientation . tools are located in the trans@@ forming or trans@@ forming sp@@ elling .
photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to en@@ large one photo in a minimum loss of image quality .
a painting is simple . the big question is , how you can find a painting and how you can find a picture ? how can you find a lack of information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorith@@ m is used here , makes it a good job . try him and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose the dimensions change in menu and enter the target values . dialog is visible below .
the tool to change the size is used a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to en@@ rolling the pixels . if you want a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split Inter@@ pol@@ ation to en@@ large picture . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; using a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorith@@ m was developed by the IMAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image is ret@@ ained .
regular control signal : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher of this value is necessary , the more will be smo@@ oth@@ ed , because it &apos;s difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ance effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and store are being used exactly . every single conversion for photo can be stored as text file and later re@@ loaded later .
photo inflatable is very fast at what it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load . you can break the calculation any@@ time with the button .
you can see below a example for photo blow by using a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlar@@ ged picture ( 3 ) is the result of the linear enlar@@ gement for comparison .
the cutting of a photos is not only one frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently estimated tools do not need to create a picture with the mouse , just push the mouse button and tigh@@ tening the rectangle with the mouse . you will see this sp@@ ell then see the mouse while keeping the mouse .
when you leave the mouse , the field of photos will be cut off . thus , you will receive a good overview like your photo after the cutting edges . you can create the size of the right @-@ to @-@ cutting edges . a new rectangle you can go easily with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the cut @-@ cut button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is tri@@ mm@@ ed ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Entries to store or file Save file to store the newly designed picture .
in the fore@@ front area you can change the size of the rectangle with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you defined in the dialog , remains in the dialog .
in the tool to an aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or horizontal format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the horizontal format is assigned .
the tool to add a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you use cm , inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to be automatic horizontal or vertical .
below the dialog can be set down in the dialog with the maximum ratio to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool To add the aspect ratio saves the next time , depending on the image orientation ( Horizontal or Vertical ) . if you are stored as default values in terms of orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will be played and not the original image .
the settings of the comp@@ ilation support enables help to set up your images , so that you have to set your images better :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ ar@@ ity . like the Dr@@ itt@@ el@@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ious triangles is a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
gold middle : the golden center is a division that foc@@ uses on different natural growth , such as the Spir@@ al of Nautilus Mus@@ cle or the Bl@@ ades of a Sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things which we find as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 988 ... and it was used to make your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you used your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is po@@ inting out of the Fibonacci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number after 1 is the golden center . the standing research is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered the visual harmon@@ ious .
the golden center represents a liquid aid lines if you set a picture in the middle of the surface . these sigh@@ tings are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring your goal good results for your photos to achieve the golden spiral line through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the multi @-@ axis along the line of spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river .
another rule is the right corner of gold spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye is turned into the center of the composition . this thing can be one line or different objects . this thing can just be done without the eye , it will ful@@ fill his task .
the Golden triangles is also taken from the top of gold spiral . their failure are the middle of the sides of the golden se@@ pul@@ sion . NOTE that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not equally tiny triangles . diagonal to these lines can be an static object .
if you use golden triangles using your frames , you create a effect of the professional photograph@@ ers dynamic sym@@ metry . try your picture focus on one of the sec@@ uting and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach any other information .
the options horizontal split and vertical nails can be used to refle@@ ct the harmon@@ ious particles .
with the button color you can set the color of auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colours and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this type , you can adjust the colour of the lines of your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle .
if you make a picture , then it happens to keep the camera not exactly verti@@ cally or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where the things are turned towards an angle . you can select that with the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . choose the free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degree . with the button default you can set the shooting again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of image will be shown above .
at your help , the module is free a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image show around the two lines you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjusted the angle as described in the previous section .
once you have turned an image in the corners , you will find un@@ wanted holes in the corners . one way to repair it is the function of transformation from the image processing .
a nice way to cut the picture is the function of automatic add@@ itives . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ ases smo@@ oth@@ ed the picture a bit after turning . notice the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ities are performed to a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the center of picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you can help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new picture , including the empty areas which have been created through the transformation .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas which were created by the transformation .
at the top : shows the current angle in degree at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
at the top : shows the current angle in degree at the top right corner of the transformed area .
at the bottom right : shows the current angle in degree at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
at the bottom right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after the adjustment of perspective the picture will be a bit dir@@ ty . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjust@@ ments generate a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have changed the perspective , you will get un@@ pleas@@ ing tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one possibility of this is the picture with trans@@ form decoration from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . with other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module with trans@@ forming sc@@ iss@@ ors .
sc@@ iss@@ ing your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you can press the default , the angles can be reset to zero . a preview of the Eff@@ ective will display you and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed right from the board field .
to help you get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to a key point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines you can now adjust the switch tool to adjust your picture .
after which you have carried out the picture , the picture is a bit conf@@ id@@ ent . for a single damage , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble , but two s@@ ings generated twice as much , so you should avoid this .
after the failure , the picture has a nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to elim@@ inate this is the picture with trans@@ form decoration designs from the image processing .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; requires a number of libr@@ aries and other packages to read image formats , therefore have been compiled by your system and , in some cases , by the type such as this libr@@ aries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions are using &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am .
due to other libr@@ aries , it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; shows only files in formats from images . if the extension in the list is listed , &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the file extensions is listed in the image processing . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; click on the section configuration .
virtually all digital cameras store photographs in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to use the format . a detailed description of these file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports both formats .
picture compression is the application of data compression method to digital pictures . in addition , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw aspect ratio , you can read by Wikipedia , The Lumin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour and helpful . you can find raw format images in JPEG or TIFF . you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; supports the load of raw images only with the program dc@@ raw , which can be found in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; they can see below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw files that are supported by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
many digital cameras supporting short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . if you see any built @-@ in possibilities for the movies . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . if you click on a film file &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you can use movies to play movies to play program .

if you get the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can carry the first four ju@@ di@@ ments with the white balance .
many tools you need the photo@@ graphic design are contained in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , plast@@ ering , smo@@ oth@@ s , ir@@ cul@@ um , ir@@ reversible , and etc ; . use a single dialog box before the filter is applied to the current image . below see &amp; quot ; text@@ ur an@@ dest@@ en@@ quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . links from him allow five buttons to the compar@@ ative mode of the previous mode . these modes are :
verti@@ cally parts without Dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected Pre@@ ferences area .
horizontal share without Dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected action area .
verti@@ cally parts . the left area depic@@ ts the original and right to the effect of the film .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and lower at the effect of the fil@@ ter .
&apos;@@ mouse via &apos; style : shows the preview if mouse is not in the action area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons on the use to show over@@ - and under@@ taking exposure . the colours can be adapted to the general unic@@ ode side .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse in the picture and on the part of the picture which you want to see you . the preview in the left part of the dialog appears immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset the buttons on your default values . all adjustment from the last use of the module are marked .
the page strip features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self ex@@ plan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters at the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive user tool based on the Marble mini@@ ature program . you can move up with the mouse wheel . press Ctr@@ l ; lin@@ ker &apos;s mouse button to move up . all pictures within this coordinates must be filtered and displayed . this is of course ahead of your paintings Geo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ colo@@ rec@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . application can be used for use of colour pal@@ let and to select colors and use of colors .
the pall@@ ets files , installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined colour and used color used color .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pal@@ let , select the file to files .
c@@ ursor is shown in the pal@@ let view as line . it can be moved , by cli@@ cking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside the colour . the colour is described under the pal@@ let view . here the color name can be changed .
it can also be used too . to move a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor way . then move the mouse at pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is added to the button color , the color is added to the c@@ ursor down . the color will be inserted either , or writes another ; depending on whether the mode can be selected . these mode you can adjust the check box below the C@@ ursor in both mode .
a selection , which was created in the last section , can be used together with the actions cop@@ ying , cutting and insert .
&amp; k@@ colo@@ rec@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the barbell rack : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue , and a optional colour name , followed by a further color . if you are three numer@@ able values in the meantime , you can be inserted as a paint in &amp; k@@ colo@@ rec@@ dit .
the colours in the pal@@ let and the color choice can be drawn with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find in the ink on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graphic programs are used . so far , there was no modern &amp; GU@@ I ; programs to visu@@ alize graphics ; programs , and graph@@ ical ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ project has set itself the goal to replace these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graph@@ ical surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ le ; programme .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ers ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; slow ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GU@@ I ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; calcul@@ ates the graphics and to@@ graph viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graphics in &amp; Kate ; to open graphic and graphic viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component is open
loading by large graphics ( currently there are problems over 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ le ; program that requires the &amp; graph@@ ical ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for display of the graphics cards . need to be used in detail :
the main window shows the open graphic , each in a own lower window . at the beginning , if you start &amp; cold viewer , the main window is empty as the symbol file , and the ( empty ) list Last modified files . click on the first symbol to display the dialog file .
after you have chosen one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , a look at the corner is displayed if the graph is bigger than the character size . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select that position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and without special fast@@ ing , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ om@@ es is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below , you can see the maximum adjustment of a graphic .
if the straight vie@@ wers in &amp; graphic viewer ; charged file has been changed from another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ign@@ ore the change , so that the decision to be ig@@ no@@ red . if you want to change your decision later , you can also use the menu item as a graph @-@ viewer , see also .
if you can open a Graph@@ ite outside of a running &amp; graphic viewer ; Inst@@ ance , &amp; eg ; in file browser or at the command line , you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; Inst@@ ance you want or to inv@@ iting graphics in a window of the ongoing instance .
as with the last option you can store your choice , but do this also change with the align@@ ment dialog .
in the program boot , you can open all the graphic presentation of your final session . again , you can record your choice both and change later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split into multiple sides . the horizontal and vertical pages can be selected .
if you are using several sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s are to be set on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the page may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several sides distributed graphics without head line and with another font
the site again provides the possibility to define the behaviour if a file is changed , and eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re @-@ upload or the program can be ig@@ no@@ red ) or the program every time .
the page open the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; cold viewer . if a graph is open outside of the current session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( the graph in a new window , or in a window of the current session ) or determine that each time is being asked .
the site meetings are the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; cold viewer . you can specify a standard behavior ( the files in the last session or not ) or determine if you want to be asked .
the Con@@ text menu , which usually appears in a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; further features :
here you can choose among various vi@@ vi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorith@@ ms select . the entries , as they are described on the web site of &amp; graph@@ ical ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Alg@@ orith@@ m , the standard for the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ent graph@@ s . the Alg@@ orith@@ m puts the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom , or left to the right ) and then trying to produce a short edges and as possible .

the printing assistant allows several pictures on a sheet paper together . the combined pictures can be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : sen@@ sible to improve you or with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your digital format stored in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command lines of the command of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Ih@@ m@@ ist : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera eller . sometimes you get the dc@@ raw results ! .
first , select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can look at the effect of your current settings .
you can now turn the values to optimi@@ ze the values , whether the camera settings can be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplif@@ iers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to process the picture later .
a four @-@ colour RG@@ BG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the RG@@ BG Switch has no effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview you can select one of the three output formats and the file name remains similar , and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG has been used one loss of algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all information of your picture and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ ZW Com@@ pression .
if you have frequently asked their images often or later on the other hand , you should not use the JPEG format , as it is only a limited number of operations allows you to keep the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
in case you can choose JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted to your settings , you can start button to start button . if you want to break this process , you can break off this process .
the st@@ acker processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to one time . use this mode only if you are safe , e.g. through testing on a single image that are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , this is helpful if this was produced in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the advanced bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the convert from the Im@@ age@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ ame of all images of a album . you can set pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amps can be used .
this module can be used to change the size of several pictures of a picture collection . it uses the Convert program from the Im@@ age@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can use the image to be smaller or en@@ large . in addition , four types of images are provided :
propor@@ tional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of picture is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : dimensions change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adap@@ t your image to the screen format .
not propor@@ tional : not propor@@ tional magn@@ itude in two dimensions . the aspect ratio will be changed in this option .
preparation : prepare the picture for photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and size of phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , includes background size , Rand@@ om size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images in advance . other pictures can draw on the list of sending paintings and put there .
after you started the module , the images will be displayed with you selected pictures . via the button , you can add another pictures to you using a file selection dialog . for the last picture , a preview of the right image will be displayed on the right side .
you can also draw pictures to the picture list and add it to the list of send@@ est images .
using the button pictures , the selected pictures are removed from the list of send@@ mail images .
after you selected all pictures you can open the new message with the button . open your e @-@ mail clients . you need to add here the addresses and the subject . you need to add pictures from you selected pictures already as an@@ nex .
look not to send a lot of pictures on once . most E @-@ mail accounts have limit@@ ations for the size of sending e @-@ ma@@ ils . it might be a good idea to send multiple em@@ ails when you want to send many images .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for the images of the images . their configuration will be stored and will change it again until you change them .
choose your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the election of comments in a modified file the comments are inserted into a text file and included the mail .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality will not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original em@@ if@@ ers will be added to full pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down the status messages that you can watch out after errors , but you can automatically start automatically at the end . with the knob , you can sh@@ allow this window ? en .

the option Open@@ GL passes in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant aspect outputs via Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , as the Di@@ asch@@ au is very slowly .
the fil@@ ename can display the fil@@ ename , see the fil@@ ename of images in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the option ri@@ bbon makes the presentation available in a final loop through traffic . you can break them manually with Es@@ c ;
the option images applies to this , that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of images in the album .
under delay between frames can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspon@@ d 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen trans@@ itional effect . you should exchange it before you show your friends !
there are more than a do@@ zen transition effects of which you can choose . random cho@@ oses each transition between the images another effect .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left screen . move the mouse into this corner to complete it .
with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and rest@@ art the previous and next image , and stop the Di@@ asch@@ au .
at the left lower screen , you can see the current file names , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module time &amp; date does not have any documentation . if you are interested , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ org@@ . attention : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module display is a tool to set a picture as a background picture for working surface .

&amp; photo@@ graphic album ; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your images . one is written in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built in the following part of user manual , which allows you to create over the HTML menu .
before HTML pages , you need to use some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area will be precise .
first , enter the title of over@@ looked and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ graphic album , HTML example pages you can see an example for this settings .
as next , you choose from whether a special photo@@ graphic album ; -@@ export file will be created on the review page . ferry information on export files you will find in .
last , you can select that information can be displayed on the HTML page . therefore , you can avoid information that are also exposed to the viewer . for example , NOTE that all pictures are exported . you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain fri@@ gh@@ nuts .
in this section you can specify how to look the HTML page . most adjust@@ ments are clearly , so that it is not specially received specially for this .
below on the page you can adjust various resolutions for the images . this makes those who want to consider your website and monitor the maximum resolution 800x600 , no images are supported , for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time . it can thus be config@@ ured to see your images with a lower resolution , as well as it would like to obtain a picture in larger resolution , it can be conf@@ used to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , place the different folder and UR@@ L where your site is stored .
best select your HTML files for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder .
first you must select the principal folder , in which all your pictures are stored . this file will be stored and when you need to specify the memory location . here you can select either a file or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if you have created this really all for viewer . if you have created a web browser , after the pages were created , the UR@@ L that will start here , should start this file . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if you are not yet to copy the files created by you using HTML files not in final destination . this is not to specify the final target of the files , but the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic file in which are all sub@@ folder .
the just described setup possibilities have moved all three based on base files or UR@@ L@@ s . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name you specify in output files .
if you are searching for a family celebration , a conference or anywhere else , you wish to create a HTML page to view the images . if you are already much time , the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not yet able to make this work yet .
you can export your images into a .@@ k@@ im file , you can import a copy of your images in a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you distingu@@ ish it in the file only a lin@@ king to pictures or whether in the file only a link to pictures are that you have set all images into the file , and can be transmitted to this file . the ob@@ vious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im -@@ file either directly from the menu to export ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im -@@ file looks for pictures on your way . first , the pictures of the .@@ k@@ im file are not found . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ export .
in the following , the dialog allows you to export the export of pictures you can export via the menu file ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it must act at internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choice possibilities :
at option of manual in the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
cop@@ ied to the .@@ k@@ im file proximity to the .@@ k@@ im file , the images will automatically be cop@@ ied for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zi@@ pped files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG , and the XML file is worth it not really worth the files . if you want to define it , then select the option of export file .
the last option of this page is Maximum image size . when you send your friends images , the pictures may not be larger in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can say that each picture should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file using cel@@ est@@ .@@ k@@ im from web browser or from the menu to select imp@@ orter ... , will be photo@@ graphic album ; the export database was described as described in described .
the assistant to the import@@ ation consists of four steps . first , you need to select what pictures you would like to import them into the file the import images should be cop@@ ied .
it may be that you are the category of the people to imported the staff ( if you are a Dane ) , while this category is asked to be imported in the third dialogue window , which will be imported in the third dialogue window , and these categories of the database correspon@@ d to the database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the selected database with the categories of your current database . an example of this you see on the picture .
it must be simple to search pictures and view : if you look like pictures , you would like to see pictures within different picture groups &amp; md@@ ash ; if you want to discover images of your Italy vacation , you might want to see all images that is depic@@ ted on this bo@@ y@@ friend .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) connections for information about your images , via ( 2 ) the search and see , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adapt@@ ations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today takes care of your videos . many places in this manual is spoken over images , but often bad videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ graphic album ; save all his information in the file in@@ dex@@ .x@@ ml in the top folders of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where you want .
and photograph@@ ing the folder , in which your pictures are stored and used this in future start . if you want to start a different database with pictures , you can start up a different database . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / in@@ dex@@ .x@@ ml .
more about the menu entry settings ; set up ... go to a window , with which you can change the settings from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of user manual , you can be explained in the following section .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call settings the preview and options for viewing the viewer . for each setting it is available through a button on the F1 button and one click on the desired option .
it was described in you , as you can define for each picture different properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
on check the dialog that is used to work already existing groups . for each existing groups you can select a lab@@ elling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories , sub@@ categories were already mentioned in the dialog option . for example , all members of a group will be set up in a group instead of all groups of a funding instead .
in you see the setup possibilities you can choose to set your disposal of members . you can select the category to select the category . in the left window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ log ; it divi@@ des his module system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . access information on the website of K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called by the modules . the modules can &apos;t be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; cold photo . they are not sold separately . most modules have a help of the modules , which you can call over the modules yourself .
since the modules were used together with multiple applications , it may be tested that the modules are used with the demo database ; just before you can call it on your own pictures - Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu . tell you , I would not have been war@@ ned !
the applications that use the modules about K@@ IP@@ I common , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you divi@@ des with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a file . also when &amp; cold albums ; this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the functions using &amp; photo@@ graphic album .
in addition , sim@@ ulated &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that shows you the picture preview at the moment .
next to the current album I have to be photo@@ graphic album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here is a photo@@ graphic album as follows :
if you record , your browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then the entry of this category is a record for the module .
or it will be specified as a category for virtual albums , if you have set the category for virtual albums , for example , if you have chosen the category for example , if you have chosen for example , if you have selected persons to view and the module .
as a number of modules with &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; not compatible you can remove these from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and select the modules , which modules should be loaded .
on the image you can see an example for a starting screen once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start your own pictures .
as you can use any other K@@ DE application , you can see the top of the menu and a tool bar . in the section we don &apos;t have any information about your images . in the section we will go back on this window , now click on the entry to show you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; is the possibility to view any image with edit@@ orial notes , where the picture was taken separately or for a bigger number of images specific add@@ ings at the same time . if the images are pic@@ tured here , and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded .
all these notes can be used for the search and browser , as you can read in section . if you want to see this purpose if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in you see three lists with a text box by using people , locations and key@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ graphic album , as you can always use them back when you enter information on your pictures .
the following idea is the shi@@ fting the pictures within the list : if you are depic@@ ted for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be depic@@ ted , so that the names listed above are shi@@ fted up@@ ward , those individuals will be faster and ord@@ ed .
if you prefer to receive an ill@@ iter@@ ative list , click on the icon for sorting to date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture , you would like to work all the selected pictures and add these pictures with edit@@ orial notes . click in this case , please click on the top and back @-@ buttons that are located at the top of the picture above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and the menu item will be added to one side with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . also San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ board . in order to show you that it is an additional group is displayed a special symbol .
in the context menu of the ann@@ ot@@ hes@@ ation is it possible to add a record to an existing or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also create an entry into a category or sub@@ category to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . NOTE that you just make your categories ill@@ iter@@ ative sort by this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the edit@@ orial notes by loc@@ ating the body that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can make a separate window by using it out outside the window area .
if you have been adapted to your needs to your needs , you are pleased with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you among others the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame as well . if you want to sign this window later , use the button options ... and here window will see here a / f@@ ading . this process will see in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures you select an overview with a preview of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you don &apos;t have any filter . an example , you can see the size of the curtains , con@@ figure out of the mouse with the middle mouse button , con@@ figure it . try it easy .
if you think a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture will be established as background picture for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this is shown in the picture viewer . if you are not open a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures you can delete pictures from you to delete pictures and select either the remov@@ ing button or choose the menu selection . now , you will display the window , which you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you for this problem . you can also use with &amp; cold photo . you can also use the pictures somewhere in the database index . of course you &apos;ll see the pictures somewhere in the database index . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images from the hard drive can be loaded .
pictures of which the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this is e.g. for the images 1 @-@ 9 . however , examples are present , such a photo@@ graphic album , you can display the preview of this pictures . however , you can &apos;t watch this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you need this feature that you want to copy files from files and back again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid this file , if you don &apos;t want to avoid using your images . if you want to avoid another hard disk to save all images to save all images .
in the menu images you can find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to do any more privacy if you want to see any more privacy in the menu . alternatively , you can also see all images that you can see your little sister , and choose the menu entry .
thus , you have set the pictures in the case of the fan . if you have to specify the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , which you may have locked , be bl@@ ind@@ ed . if you would like the pictures you don &apos;t want to lift up the pictures .
it is also possible to specify a password required for un@@ lock the pictures . to set this password , select password change in privacy .
please consider that this image protection is very reliable . for one you can read all pictures on the hard drive and to the other can read or delete the password than un@@ lock text content or delete . this type of password protection is only to those who are with &amp; cold album ; not very familiar , to rep@@ el the view of private photos .
the reason why you would spend all your images with &amp; photo@@ graphic album ; of course you want to review them somet@@ ime . from this reason , you can look at any picture . from this reason , you can start from this preview as described in described .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but added any more information about the picture , like who is on the image , when and where was done it , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the upper part of the picture you want , so you can also use this simple with the mouse , and what can be displayed . all these options are available according to a right click on the viewer . that then the text menu can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are lower . if you click here , refer to the browser , see , matching entries at this time . if you click on Anne Helene , the browser shows you all pictures from Anne Helene . as if you were guests from the browser and then Anne Helene would have chosen you .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and back switch , by using the keys picture high and picture . you can also easily reach the first and final picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the text menu .
if multiple pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as a dip . &amp; cool album ; then a new picture can be stopped by using the Str@@ g button and Plus or Min@@ us . started and stopped by the buttons Ctr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the e@@ ders from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer is using the complete place on the screen . use the input key to switch off in full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer , you can use a rectangle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can find out that the Plus key is zo@@ om@@ ed into the center of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ om@@ ed with the zoom , so that each pixel equals a pixel size of image .
NOTE that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ators work at videos , that are her@@ ein and with@@ drawn with the Plus@@ - and min@@ ust@@ ers .
using the screen@@ ings from the text menu , you can rotate the picture . this is not work with videos . you can do notes regarding the current image with the menu notes from the text menu .
if you consider images , you can see a picture with a person whose names you can see on the image . in the moment you can add to check out and configuration dialog . but they will probably move the image to mark and look for more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and they can mark them as good or bad .
for the two examples above , you can view the option pictures with features , while you see them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you can press the corresponding letter . in a look , you see a picture of the A , B and C .
once you have set features of your images , you can see you in your browser . if you have selected all the pictures you can print , or whatever you are always selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and particularly characteristics can be displayed in the front view . if you can view Categories in dre front view , then you can select features to the pictures , simply add the letters for the feature , after the image was chosen . this can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint the photo@@ graphic album .
this is not stored in the picture , but in the database . on the way you can reset your gem@@ old later on .
in case you can see a picture on the painted game . in order to finish the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . to complete the image from the text @-@ menu . to end the dung , simply feel the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , you must not rule the use of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood them .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ eling views yellow .
you can also select several objects simultaneously . but not the object of a already selected object , as all sub@@ objects already selected with the object .
in order to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position to insert the object and select either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or choose a menu entry in the menu .
there are multi@@ ply possible positions , the following valve menu will end , so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar below or from the right @-@ menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click here to check these changes . if you have in@@ valid values , you have displayed a message with a bug code . then you can click the input and click to break up the changes with canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the align@@ ment dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the help file .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
if you work a tex@@ ture or a part of a tex@@ ture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press a preview of the team @-@ view and a small example of the scene is chosen with the chosen text file , even if you want to ren@@ der a text ( for example a tex@@ ture within a tex@@ ture @-@ Map and not the entire tex@@ ture Map ) , cross the loc@@ ally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw this control points with the mouse button , and change the position and change direction of camera .
if a transformation is selected , dis@@ appear the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire @-@ model view . this cross marked the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the Shift with the mouse in the entire window .
each object has a wire @-@ level model . you can specify this value relatively to visual acu@@ ity or as an absolute value . objects will be displayed if they selected or their vis@@ ibility level , or equal to the comp@@ ress level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window set as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graph@@ ical views right .
if you do not like the default Window Reg@@ ulations , or if you need a different arrangement , you can save you directly . you can also save multiple window arran@@ gem@@ ents , and easily change between different arran@@ gem@@ ents .
around a window over or under a present view , draw the author to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , draw the editor to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then ver@@ ted on the right or left side of this view , stret@@ ching over the entire height .
if you wish to arrange several views on each other , draw the editor in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by cli@@ cking on the map by cli@@ cking up to the views .
the last potential sh@@ utter order is floating views : views , which are not in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the author to the working area , or click on the bottom to the left depic@@ ting an arrow in the shape strip .
to complete a view , click on the small cross in the shape strip . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu , you &apos;ll find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can ver@@ ify them at any site .
the current window view can store you with view window to store . it will be displayed a dialog when you can save the window of the window under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ der it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g to ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed correctly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ der the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering the symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene .
an Ren@@ der mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . he needs ren@@ der image size and quality of ren@@ ders . if you want to ren@@ der a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels , you can easily add many Ren@@ der @-@ Mod@@ i , from a fast preview to full compatibility in highest quality .
if you click on the icon of Settings in the tool bar , or in the menu of view Ren@@ der Mod@@ i ... , the following dialog is opened :
each ren@@ der mode has a name . you can enter any name , but mean@@ ing@@ ful is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size , you can bear width and height of the straight picture . if you want to ren@@ der a small area of the image , select the check box section and give the image detail to ren@@ dering part in the input position .
in combination of quality you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used to ren@@ der . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . an exhau@@ st@@ ive description of the ren@@ der features are located in user &apos;s guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture with only one beam each pixel is applied , there are often a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes they are not shown in the representation of smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ ased .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these error . generally , pictures with this feature better .
if you place anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects to P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive meth@@ od@@ ds ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling rate is further divided again and adap@@ tive because the recru@@ it@@ ment runs from the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method using POV @-@ Ray that exceeds the default threshold value , both pixels are calculated using the per@@ secution of a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you are calculated using a 4x4 additional points , a grid value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two Pix@@ ies is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixel is split into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be followed by per@@ sec@@ uted and to further sub@@ division . maximum depth of the recru@@ its you can adjust with the depth value .
another ability to be reduced the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you place J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for Quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; that diff@@ use diff@@ use lighting re@@ flex@@ ion . it takes a long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card card you can adjust if the alpha channels are calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is clear if the associated str@@ ands does not have an object .
opens a new window for the ad of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not expected , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene file , select the menu entry of the import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is currently supported &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; nor the full pre@@ ference of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when using error message or war@@ nings , a dialog appears a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , you want to write this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ ren@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to export the source file in the editor file . to import objects into the scene file , check out the source code and drag him into the object tree .
with cop@@ ying and inser@@ tion &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also available .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene is ren@@ dered . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help of the team @-@ view , click &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the item . put here the path to your document properties and version . supported , versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example of the field data ) to the paths and P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libr@@ aries . if you enter files not in file the scene , you must also use the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the paint for the wire models . the second colour is used for display of selected objects .
the paint for the control points . the second colour is used for the display of the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type license number .
you can set the object of the points to the grid in the Kon@@ text@@ men@@ ü in the wire model views . you can set up the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rotation here .
larger values show a precise wire @-@ model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the shown objects , but demand more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects like the ball can be adjusted for two directions .
if you cross a extended projection for enhanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera will have a extended projection screens . this feature gives a better approach for the proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is depic@@ ted . the wall is depic@@ ted in a table pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is controlled from two adjustable colors from two adjustable colors .
if you cross the edge of edge , the non @-@ recur@@ sive Anti@@ ali@@ asing method for Ren@@ dering of Sc@@ enes , you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value . for example , you can find specific data in the section Ren@@ der @-@ Mod@@ i .
on this page you can change existing window arran@@ gem@@ ents , or new window arran@@ gem@@ ents . in the section window arran@@ gem@@ ents , how to create window arran@@ gem@@ ents and store .
the action field standard window regulation : shows all existing windows assign@@ ments . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the chosen window regulation at the start of the program .
the list of articles shows all existing windows assign@@ ments . a new arran@@ gem@@ ents you can create with the button keys and ext@@ ingu@@ ish a selected arrangement with the button extension .
each window arrangement is identified by name . the name has to be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can create and create selected views with the button extension .
the position of the new window . with a new column , you create a new column at the right side of the existing windows , with loc@@ alized window along with the previous view and floating down the view is not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to follow any more knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate way simple scene , while they are very popular : a sphere at one level .
but you should keep the following warning lights before you can compl@@ ain about it that you can only get a black screen as a result , if you use a 3D program for the first time you should see this important rules :
if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules can be applied for ren@@ dering , as a result , you get a black image .
if you insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black picture .
if you have installed everything is installed , you can see the following pre@@ set window on the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable performance what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should see the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you need to remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then choose the menu entry . so you have now a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera is considered the whole scene . not@@ ably , you notice that the scene from the view@@ point of view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now includes a new entry with the designation camera . if they click here , check the contents of view object properties that can be found in the various parameters of camera . in user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
please change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions . but note that the camera in the view control points , with which you can change the finish line of camera . click on the left mouse button on a control point , and drag him to the desired location .
if you press the button or the input pressure , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree immediately apply accordingly to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might add a qu@@ ader ( Insert body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s a constant method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; actually a simple possibility . you can use an endless level as the ground :
a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the names and press the button , or press En@@ ter . in the object tree , the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view is now also the plain , even at the moment only the limited level . if you ren@@ der the scene , the plain is extended to the h@@ oriz@@ on .
if you can see the object tree exactly , you &apos;ll find the entry for the bottom . you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and translation . choose one of these options , change the possible settings regarding the object properties .
in this scene you should move the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only you should learn some of these parameters . choose shi@@ fting and set the values as follows :
choose the ground to display its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit multiple .
in both cases a dialog appears in which you can select how the object will be inserted . please select the name in the property name ( name = bottom Pigment ) , with one click on the button preview you can see how the pig@@ ment now looks now .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a m@@ alt black material because you can still click the appearance of materials any@@ time with a click on preview . give it a lot of possibilities for the pig@@ ment . there &apos;s many possibilities , but you can now take the eas@@ iest .
if you do not see any colour on Qu@@ ader and Sp@@ here , click the button on the button and call the preview .
the material for the ground is right now . if you ren@@ der your picture now with a click on the symbol , you should receive the following result :
of course you are not the color scheme . you need to have two new attri@@ butes . in the color list you need to do two new attri@@ butes . then edit this entry two ( you can also do more frequently , but the ch@@ ord @-@ d@@ ashboard list can only be used with two colors ) :
please select in the object tree in any colour and change the colors in the view of the objects :
this step you should already be able to execute the bas@@ ically the principle of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you have already understood . the ball can be just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can change immediately the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget the sphere around the ground . otherwise , the ball would be floating above the ground , as you have shi@@ fted the floor around a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the ren@@ der gives now a strange result : as already before , the ball @-@ surface looks like a sheet black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have chosen the sphere , you can now show a material as already at the bottom , enter the sphere no pig@@ ment than colour :
choose the first pad and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click on the sphere of pig@@ ment , then select Single Fabri@@ cs and set the values as follows :
but you can reach an interesting effects if you take the time to display some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screens and click on to use or press En@@ ter .
the settings reflection and reflection are already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromed surfaces , even if metal : still not selected is :
you should now have a good impression of it , which offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; we &apos;ve already learned as much as much , that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a ren@@ der -@@ method to generate a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you have a scene , the Ren@@ der hyp@@ oth@@ et@@ etic rays from the perspective of the actu@@ ation ( i.e. from the camera that refle@@ cts the scenes ) through each pixel and atmosph@@ eric effects of light sources in the scene , and as the atmosph@@ eric effects , as for example fog can be processed .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source you can also see anything , the picture is simple black . appar@@ ently , every scene must be applied , some light sources and at least one camera .
in usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ pov or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in a standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler .
always if you open a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
have you already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . is it a new file , you must enter a name and storage space .
port@@ ra@@ ises the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been dis@@ card@@ ed since the last stor@@ ing .
you can only select this menu , if you do not have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last re@@ conc@@ ern commandment . this menu entry can only be chosen , if you don &apos;t use process .
save the current window Order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new type or an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the look , the key cutting and standard behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ est . you can change this option pre@@ set user command for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; change commands or a new option .
opens a dialog to setting up tool@@ bars . you can add a tool@@ holder for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to use rough surfaces , without any Be@@ ule on the surface individually mod@@ eling and without the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is usual to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ Map and a tex@@ ture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric forms that you can use as modules : very complex 3D models are made of do@@ zens or even hundreds of these principles . this models will continue to give them a realistic look .
a tex@@ ture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color to pixel base , using a picture file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to the display .
pictures can be displayed in a private window in the size of image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; cake show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with cli@@ cking &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return .
you can adjust if every image is displayed in a own window , or whether all pictures are using the same window .
if you are looking for a certain file , please refer to the first sign of the fil@@ ename in a browser window . then a small input field is found , the file will be high@@ ligh@@ ted . you can leave the input field through pressu@@ res of Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue entry &amp; curi@@ osity ; there are five cards cards . in three of them , General and mach@@ ining and slide show , you can set out the work of &amp; cake for your browser , you can set the keys for the respective windows .
if this image is selected , then the images will be open in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill out the screen , the rest of the ad width is filled with the background . the default is not a full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; curi@@ osity ; already the next image in the folder , while you still choose the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
this option saves &amp; cake ; at the end of the last opened Ord@@ ner . at the next start , you will open the folders in their browser window .
click on the color beams to fill a background color . this is used in order to fill the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with selected color .
you can handle &amp; curi@@ osity ; so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display panel is enlar@@ ged to the full screen . this option is enabled .
specify whether the sli@@ des@@ how should start with the first picture in the file or the selected image .
the period between the ex@@ changes in a slide show . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the sli@@ der field , or the small arrows right next to the input field , the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is broken down until it is broken down to the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the sli@@ der field , and the small arrows turn right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keys for the different operational modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in card maps for the display panel and short command for the brow@@ s@@ ers .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for sub @-@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one part view of the file system with files and files in a window .

the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; it is the developer mail@@ ing@@ list . instructions to join the developers of Mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; show@@ photo .
&amp; show@@ photo you will provide as much control of his working processes as possible . there are many options that use the behaviour of &amp; show@@ c@@ ation . to set up on this settings , you have to be divided into eight pages . you can change between these , by placing the symbols of the left .
in the area of exposure indic@@ ators you can select the color , if the under@@ - or over@@ exposed aggreg@@ ator was selected . sk@@ ill@@ ings should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast . exposure time should show a bright color and over@@ exposure to a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; owns one side panel on the right edge , which offers you important information and actions on selected pictures . you can also view this page , in which you can click on one of the five ri@@ ders :
&amp; sk@@ ill , it is an application for scanning images that doesn &apos;t make more images than images and re@@ pos@@ it@@ ry .
&amp; sk@@ ill , it is a simple use to sc@@ ans images , which doesn &apos;t make more images than images and save as pictures in a specified folder , or save the images immediately in a given file with automatically generated names and format . users can also show the pictures before the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project website using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ er@@ ator ; when this scanner is not open . if this scanner is not open , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog appears to choose the scanner selection .
users can select the scanner to use the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . leave it to break down the scanner .
the further settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ er@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) deals with these options .
in order to read an image , the user may start a feed can start and then scanning the scan range for final scan . the feed can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image , the user can go beyond and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom , that the complete preview can fit into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan knob .
if you choose a preview of a preview of the settings the picture is selected , then the picture is pressed while below is displayed , then the picture is stored , and lie ? en leads to a break@@ through and you will get back into the main window .
due to the button settings the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
users can see the image , if desired , consider , prior to store . in this case , the option has to be selected a preview . if this preview of user is not desired , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them the way to select the kind like &amp; sk@@ ill . pictures will open the dialog for each image . when &amp; sk@@ ill , this automatically generates a gener@@ alized file in a previously defined file , you will need to save a fil@@ en@@ ames without any fil@@ en@@ ames .
this setting defines the images if the images are stored in the option , if the pictures are stored for any scan , then this folder will be used as a default for dialogue . the default is your home directory , and you can change it with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically , and is the proposed name for the image in the dialog for stor@@ ing . the automatically stored picture gets an numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
users can adjust the image quality for saving image quality . this value does not change the compression value for stor@@ ing . if select image quality is not selected , the value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help kick off the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ ill ; -@@ Manual . the knob About the K@@ DE About -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; sk@@ ill ; . the knob displays the dialog for the settings and closing .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used as all the other programs key cutting . below , you can establish a list of these ab@@ bre@@ viation and their function . choose the global button key into the player window and select Glo@@ b@@ ale button keys in the player window and select the right mouse button in the player window and select a brief command .
you may possibly make the existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ in order to work your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which is also available in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is to describe the D@@ COP functions , play @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists and scrip@@ ts . a example call for the D@@ COP function pause might &amp; z@@ b ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command files of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok are still some of the command files .
you should provide a feedback , if the script may not be executed due to a lack of depend@@ ency . please check in your script if all required modules are available , so the user identification , why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ c@@ ue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding v@@ 3.4 is , for this script . &apos; , dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit exit
in the scrip@@ ts / Tem@@ plates , you will find a lot of pre @-@ scrip@@ ts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scrip@@ ts or they simply have to expand the required functions . they will be fast that the writing of scrip@@ ts is relatively easy .
using D@@ COP , your scrip@@ ts can replace your scrip@@ ts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the eas@@ iest way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p , which should be supplied in each of the K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ts offer the execute of external programs and commands . this is usually use ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way it can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here , an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sen@@ ds not@@ if@@ ications to all scrip@@ ts . for this reason , scrip@@ ts their default submit to monitor and re@@ act to events . of course , a script will also ign@@ ore the events if there is no use .
con@@ figure shows the script dialog to display the align@@ ment dialog . if a script has to be launched every sk@@ ri@@ pt . if a script will be launched , Amar@@ ok the working files onto the folder , where all data will be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ change signals that a new piece is used . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions for more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ change new@@ disk signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ary Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu , sub@@ direc@@ ts the path to select the selected files of the play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be added to the menu entry . to remove the menu entry to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remov@@ e@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; or if the user stops a script , sen@@ ds &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M will be processed to the script . for example , this signal should be processed for example , e.g. the saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok Sk@@ ri@@ pt administration can also install script packages which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be comp@@ uted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be seen also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , so the users can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok sk@@ ri@@ pt package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only sk@@ ri@@ pt packages with the extended amar@@ ok@@ script . from this reason you should make your script packages right properly .
the main script must be able to be exec@@ ut@@ able ( + x ) , the remaining for load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ ut@@ able . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the W@@ iki script page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ icks @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scrip@@ ts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and high @-@ performance functions and is still sur@@ pris@@ ingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can make music simply into the play@@ list , instead of endless men@@ s , you may also look for a specific title from thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collec@@ ting browser and the fast @-@ search for you will find the piece within seconds .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; it can be used without trouble on the align@@ ment dialog . the align@@ ment dialog has several cards to set up various functions of the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the player window will open the player window , in addition to the play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is used .
Tuning barometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compatible with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . option switches the experimental function of the tuning unit .
check @-@ out design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bars . this means the used color scheme for tuning activity changes .
voting files for music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ able files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings file from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you select the browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it should be started when a browser is needed .
other browser use : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not on the list .
to save the play@@ list when loading , stores the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running track .
relative paths for the stored play@@ list : if you activ@@ ate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory of the play@@ list , otherwise , the absolute position of music files are stored .
all of the pieces in the piece is visible , that the play@@ lists window is up / down , to keep the each of the current pieces always in the visible window area .
in the change of the context @-@ browser , automatically shows the context @-@ browser once the next unit is contained .
in the section , you can adjust to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is part of the section in three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section you can use the use of different writ@@ ings in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select scrip@@ tures for the following section : play@@ lists windows , player window and context @-@ browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a required font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom@@ ized colour scheme , you can define the Qu@@ al of your choice and can use their own col@@ sch@@ ema . use which including activated paint selectable for front and background color .
play the start playing the start , and Amar@@ ok ; after the program , playback will automatically continue with the piece in the place where it stopped at the last time .
the window on @-@ screen display allows you to insert the inser@@ tion of the OS@@ D . when on @-@ Screen display , a preview of OS@@ D is displayed and you can consider the effect of all settings for this preview .
the first option is the font . click on to select from the dialog select the required font to the OS@@ D . the cruci@@ field shadow has shown that the text is depic@@ ted in the OS@@ D sh@@ aded .
in other colours you can use the opportunity to adjust the OS@@ D colors for scrip@@ tures and background . if you don &apos;t use the dialog to color selection . if your colours is not enabled , the pre @-@ pre @-@ produced &amp; cold paints are used .
the input field Display text represents the OS@@ D text . by the set of space , the OS@@ D can be adapted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available space holder and what they mean .
the option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama Us@@ ers . thus , you can specify , on which screen a multiple monitor environment that should appear in the OS@@ D .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection list . some drivers re@@ activ@@ ate additional setting options in this card card .
the Map Collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . it includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the file , cover &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after playing music files . to obtain a file into the collection , select the check box next to his name . this section also contains anchor fields to insert , as with the selected folders .
search as well : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder .

recovery lists imports : concerned that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection file ( .@@ pl@@ und and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will be added later in the play@@ list .
the item collec@@ ting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination driver : can be selected between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , there is no further institu@@ tion in the MySQL installation .
the MySQL @-@ device is used for the set of the database for Amar@@ ok ; used under calcul@@ ator : the network is set to the MySQL database . then , under port : the network port is available under the database . name : is the data set to which the connection is produced .
use us@@ ername : and password : enter the data available for the link to the database .
the card work@@ .@@ f@@ m te@@ aches the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can trans@@ mit the names of a split pieces on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current quantity .
here you can download your user name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have any profile , you can register one at the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send forth pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the names of the spread pieces on your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see in the summary of functions and gallery with screens .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programmes included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to compiled e.g. modules or scrip@@ ts ) . we have written a small guide as you compiled K@@ deli@@ bs minimum .
some functions such as the OS@@ D pre@@ dict that your window manager will run the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ to@@ p.@@ org . for example , we try to assist trouble on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these represent excellent development environment .
probably one of your files created a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang on the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it is that Tag@@ lib at reading Met@@ a @-@ Infos of this file system . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is slightly more mature .
ensure that all by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used the libr@@ aries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to desc@@ end to the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then turn off . turn off , if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also don@@ ate us the back@@ pack by e @-@ mail ( the email opened automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurr@@ ing crash and send us a good back@@ pack@@ er , the error is guaranteed .
this is in mind that many program files can write data as UTF @-@ 8 to the Met@@ a @-@ Info , but this is not known as Unicode . the following Per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Er@@ ror $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;

after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it appears only a empty play@@ list . how come here music pieces ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then draw the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window is converted into the statistics window . you will find it under Extr@@ as statistics .
the importance of these ic@@ ons has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : so far for an evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evalu@@ ate pieces in the play@@ list , in the play@@ list of the play@@ list and select column rating . click somewhere in the new evaluation column for example . you can also use the brief inter@@ section Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
choose the files you would like to remove and then select ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then choose from re@@ claim list from the base menu .
pull a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let it fall here , just as you would like to make it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the add @-@ button , the knob play@@ list . click on .
pres@@ um@@ ably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install @-@ Amar@@ ok ; look at a look at lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ al@@ iz@@ ations .

no . Yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the Back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question are supported for G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support any of any mem@@ orable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even text and PNG de@@ code !
it may be ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where in the default , no MP3 decoder will be supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 , input
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must use a bl@@ ender with hardware @-@ mixer ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . look to the Hil@@ deg@@ ard D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command would be to help you looking for the problem with problem and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
the do &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media first can be de@@ co@@ d . you can only try a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sen@@ ds the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ d the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can give it directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimi@@ ze the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable the sound of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ rap@@ per su@@ id is set out :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x you can cause problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that may cause any playback . Read the sound of sound buffer in your AL@@ SA align@@ ment file .@@ as@@ oun@@ t@@ c can also help .
either use not the Arts driver , instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ mb@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
pres@@ um@@ ably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the visu@@ al@@ iz@@ ations . Yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , over@@ threw &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . perform G@@ ST register out to register all the Stre@@ amer components .
Read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that &apos;s not helps , you can also ask the IR@@ C @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok in advance ! ) : - Store your FF@@ m@@ peg files , once more than your normal user . then delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config ( g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and perform G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .

if you call this entry , you can select over the exhau@@ st@@ ive dialog files to the project . if the current project comes directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so published files in the base file of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is the same as the properties tab of the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only open when the project has already contains data .
opens the characteristics dialog for the current project . here , you can see many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are these ? ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you are using files for a multiple session . this is not useful if you are using files for a multiple session . it is thought to you rather than help , so that you can see in the medium already existing files and file .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function illustr@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function remov@@ es no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
opens the CD @-@ copy dialog . this allows you to create a copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use any image of a CD which you should burn somet@@ ime instead of the normal head . they shou@@ ldn &apos;t want to copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to create a copy of DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use any image of a DVD with the help of cop@@ ying dialogue . in addition , the target medium will not be enough to take the target medium to be able to record the entire ( video ) data from the source code .
opens the dialog to the del@@ eting of a CD @-@ RW . thus , you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to Form@@ att@@ eren a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , allows you to write the choice between the type@@ writing and incre@@ mental .

the settings will open from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program adjust@@ ments will be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hie@@ b . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and intended for the program of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , as many other &amp; k@@ gs ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ sk@@ ri@@ pt .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the bit more comfortable program k@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to your taste and the type of your task is cru@@ cial , which the add programs you may be den@@ om@@ iting .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to ensure the &amp; D@@ COP ; you must make sure you have to ensure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions , all &amp; k@@ de ; program measured , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for creating new projects .

as a result of a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can generate a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ ers ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ ds ( Q@@ String Beach , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ flow ID ( Q@@ String )
thus , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script file . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ ers ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ fo@@ res@@ bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / fo@@ o / fo@@ o / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; read@@ out for &amp; k@@ le ; . with him all simply audio CD ; s read and can be stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the computer , installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many co@@ di@@ ers , which have to be installed in WAV files ( to the Linux distribution ) . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( lost free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format , or other formats like the los@@ s@@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia uses . almost any distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it &apos;s probably not necessary to comp@@ ile something for any Linux distribution . but if using FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
what co@@ di@@ vers / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer provides a small introduction on Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if not the firmware version of the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to read a protected audio CD ; not the mechan@@ isms of copy protection . avoid the purchase of cop@@ ying protected audio CD ; s !
while they only be done only once ( the align@@ ment dialog can be done so often called until a suitable configuration ) , the daily dealing with a &amp; CD ; this will be explained ( hop@@ efully ) for the sli@@ m approach of the user interface , via which you will stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats , depending on which , which are your co@@ di@@ ers programs installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from fre@@ ed@@ ent from the internet or can be fully integrated without network , whereby all of them is recorded .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . on the side step for step example , further information is used as well as screens with descriptions of the regist@@ ers for the program of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data on request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be loc@@ ally or online in the latter case , first to be connected to the Internet . )
starts the read and - if a encoder in the tab setting is config@@ ured in the setup note - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so the option can be read with another encoder as the standard . it &apos;s note that previously the encoder in the tab setting is config@@ ured .
opens the file manager , so that a full file can be chosen to enc@@ ode instead of a full &amp; CD ; add to enc@@ ode and enc@@ ode .
opens the align@@ ment dialog to con@@ figure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main monitoring dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different cards ( such as Encoder , to set the encoder ) . go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , Ko@@ di@@ erer and compression rates and helps you to choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is going to go , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . apart from FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available devices to restore these files .
among the audio formats , they lose information through data compression according to their p@@ sycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG files are the most common . OGG mag today a slight increase compared to MP3 in audio quality ( up to 128 kbps ) , but above these bit@@ rate , the differences are less important , because both Ko@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless free with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit rate ) , but compared with OGG light , lower quality at a de@@ eper bit rate .
OGG - if only music will be heard from one calcul@@ ator or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few exist@@ ential OGG cutting machines are present .
MP3 - if you also belongs to other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB flash , memory card , hard disk ) or special car hi @-@ fi systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these tools usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and a floating compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setup gives good transpar@@ ency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transpar@@ ency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kbps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kbps for complex musicians and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kbps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need CBR@@ B . good enough for hi @-@ fi system with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kbps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression ratio around 11 . 128 kbps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by adol@@ esc@@ ents , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kbps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most individuals and most environments , but if you don &apos;t necess@@ arily have the absolutely highest quality , you want to choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; informations that will be entered into the program as a list of parameters , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can deliver / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the coding program to generate a file name and file names as well as the characteristics of music files .
related to Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; Title to the words ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s will be enc@@ oded with l@@ ame , the switch @-@ board of l@@ ame and the title of parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator must be added ; the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button@@ number in assist@@ ants ) :
that &apos;s what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database who can download the information on the audio CDs , so that all other information can download it in the computer . it &apos;s note that here only from text will be spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of the Pieces &amp; etc ; , not by audio @-@ file himself .
Yes , it should be legal , but I am not att@@ orney . however , no one should say that you are added to the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so it can &apos;t be added to the artist nor the music company . all information can be added in a bet by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active a check box with another ( counter@@ feit ) address than those used in the system . in this kind of configuration , so it seems , the e @-@ mail address of the server is not used ( This can only be the programmer who reviewed the code . )
in many countries cop@@ ies the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the geograph@@ ically used mirror server will be used . this saves bandwidth on network and res@@ em@@ bles the burden between the host .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror ser@@ ver@@ n for online A@@ bru@@ f from &amp; CD ; Information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( generally used monthly ) only the updates will be downloaded from the database .
which read@@ out programme is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to try it in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading Audio CD ; s. To be aware that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia Package must be installed if this is not yet happened .
for stor@@ ing the dis@@ able WAV files , the co@@ di@@ ers and thus select the desired file format . in the first open @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the tab . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the co@@ di@@ ers package must be installed by using Linux distribution , before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined coding . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a co@@ di@@ ers , further information can be obtained through the command of a command as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers .
this may have many causes . ver@@ ify the device of the device designation des &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read@@ ings of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c für O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are . try to give them both programs with a command line in a terminal . this may indicate a h@@ int to what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not be successful !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed .
have a complete manual read , all understood , but some@@ how are still un@@ sure what is still not to do something ? well yes , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will have enough information k@@ rie@@ ve that they want to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; using a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v1 key@@ boards ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as previously compiled packages for your Linux distribution . if it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , what you can always do .
please make sure that directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to own ( eg ; by trying to copy a bit anything ) .
the first section is treated with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; , something that is probably done just once .
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated every one &amp; CD ;
here we determine the comp@@ utation for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kbps ) . it is determined where the files are used and what structure is used . because we are f@@ au@@ l to use the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings , we will probably not be able to read in any reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is provided to the read@@ able program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a sym@@ bo@@ lic link to the real device designation . if this is not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be added to the device with other programs , so helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to use existing applications for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card General adjust@@ ments . here you can &apos;t have much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be specified / entered in screen photo .
just ask for un@@ complete information , so you will be informed if data are missing from the words ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . just both entries . we are comfortable and allow you to download the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet of a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
NOTE : this calcul@@ ator must be connected during reading &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet server , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is simple , is a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately , if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database record and that it can be easily changed with the database entry and the file name , and the direc@@ tories can be changed with Con@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ gers .
apart from this example is further to note : if you want to manually repair all manual and fre@@ ed@@ b , if you want to use the database before . however , this is p@@ icked about 620 MB , if you have chosen the database mode , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data @-@ upon request , for the A@@ bru@@ ises of &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b servers on the internet . how white the system will be given ? Read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything like it is shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look at a mirror server in your proximity . on this way the load will be distributed between the invo@@ ice . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work as rel@@ ate to the server , as many Fire@@ men , the protocol is only 88@@ 80 standard , there is perhaps more fortun@@ ate with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surfing in the internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to read data on the fre@@ ed@@ b servers . the first anchor field should be de@@ activ@@ ate enough .
simply take the settings from the screen photo . ( ensure that the file / f.@@ tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously working pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time at only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading of the last play : crossed it to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you can read this file , then the path must be stored in which the WAV files can be stored in which the files are not used in your folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you don &apos;t want to do something with WAV files .
all such as it is on the screen photo . the command is slightly long , under circumstances a little bit sp@@ reads to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo devices . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted as required . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; di@@ vers for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables on the names of input file ( including full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of co@@ at@@ ric WAV files : at a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be temp@@ ted to enc@@ ode more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
this section is described as described in the reading of the reading of the &amp; CD ; on the disk volume , we will be installed in the previous section , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is described , and the process of this section must be repeated for any ex@@ em@@ ing &amp; CD ;
since we can use a &amp; CD ; do not include the Screen photos a bit different from than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully supported by fre@@ ed@@ b ; they will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than they get out of the internet . comments are ob@@ vious to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find out the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD has to be specified in the drive , which is defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length are listed in the window , as described in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; identified as audio CD ; identified and could be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening , then look for questions and answers regarding the help or walk back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the title of the pieces already be filled and also will be shown in the name of the artist and the album .
for the case that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; Key for your &amp; CD ; there will select a window , and you can select the database record that your opinion is best for your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings are selected in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also get manually from the choice of the first button@@ holes in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you need to pick the data on the internet .
E 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the first piece of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artists do not have to enter the current title &apos; current title &apos; , unless you have a comp@@ ilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ ph@@ a per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments made common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful A@@ bru@@ f of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors , so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name ( e.g. all words with large letters or not ... ) , but also to test whether there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
NOTE : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags . this option will be set on the tab card ; see a look at the section &apos; basic Settings &apos; .
you can create the Tag information of the generated files later at any time with the Tag Editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . check in the help to your co@@ di@@ ers to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously with the style of the dis@@ patch CD ; in this example , this is not important because we don &apos;t exceed the &amp; CD ; - for more information , go on the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org , and read more information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are subject to rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you return to the main window . click on the line with the second one .
the window of CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you see that the fields of the album has already been completed with the specified data , we just give the entries to the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the unit to each case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and check out the same way up to all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window appears not when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third knob of the tool bar . NOTE that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
notice that there is a check @-@ character on every row of a piece . only the title will be selected . a simple click on the line , choose the selection of the piece , or select the button All pieces select the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces on the lower edge .
by cli@@ cking on the button selection of the read@@ able process started , this window appears to be confirmation . to OK , then we will see a look at the window with the ess@@ ays and track what is expected .
click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a co@@ effici@@ ently , which you have not yet installed . pieces did not have been successfully tested with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the file for the TM@@ P file and the target ord@@ ner are not what we have published here in the example . have you checked if you have write to the file for the temporary files and the target ord@@ ner ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the read@@ out of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece of it , he is finished . but we have a new entry : commissioned 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . that may be read and add @-@ in parallel . please note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration adjustment to read this behavior , is the number of parallel processes to read and enc@@ ode . in powerful machines , the used machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems no problem while reading and enc@@ ode ( from there two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third place is enc@@ oded , after the last piece is enc@@ oded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window is bl@@ ended .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need to your choice your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if you are able to sign with CV@@ S , as part of the k@@ dem@@ ulti@@ media package . if you are already an anon@@ ymous package which allows you to cons@@ ult a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read it , you probably have already done it ...
this section is addressed to people , compiled by source files , and not for users to use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help to help your needs , if it runs once , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations on settings . the best read the step for step example to know the options and settings . it shows screens of different cards in the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading , even if only the help menu after the first time of the program was cli@@ cked , without any comment on any point ( especially when the program is at the time of the program , no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can &apos;t want this manual for a manual for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; so that you can do anything else , want to do it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this section , he has understood this section and is therefore agree with this proposal .
wei@@ rd if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition to other , he did not have a real @-@ time real @-@ time real @-@ time chron@@ icle of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player .
&amp; k@@ mid , running under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - und &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Support also work &amp; k@@ mid ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultra@@ Sound Proj@@ ection , which is supported for G@@ US maps . AL@@ SA will be included as soon as it supports sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid , shows the song on the screen with changing color , so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graph@@ ical display of activity every MIDI @-@ Kan@@ als by detection of the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window on KM@@ id .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or texts ) .
seat support . if you come &amp; k@@ le ; during the play of a song , you will start playing KM@@ id for the next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synth@@ esizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US maps ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , using the help you select the desired song .
you can also allow a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window fall . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to record a piece of music , open it and st@@ hes@@ itate to play the button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry one from the menu piece or add the space button .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , once you have to pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then down one another . )
once you play &amp; k@@ mid . you can jump on a popular spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator and drive .
if you find that a song is played too fast or slowly , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of speed display . to get back the original Tempo at once again , click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space taste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break , or the select of the menu entry into the menu , the check out the playback . check the space taste during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
song ly@@ rics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use texts , other use song event and other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust what events will be displayed and even better : the event type will be selected automatically . if you choose any manually , so that you will need to manually manually . if you have chosen the entry automatic text selection , but you still have the possibility to change it , if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set a event type , select from the menu settings the entries of texts and song events . same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you are together . these will be played in the line . this section stands as you can use collections .
to put a collection , open the collections Online . here you will find in the menu collection under the point .... click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by cli@@ cking on a copy and then name the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the always required in the collections .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be stored . concerns the when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be chosen in the collections . there , you can add a song using the button . it appears in again the file dialog , using the help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding is activated , a piece is added to the opening ( using file open@@ ings or drag &amp; drop ) to the active collection .
when the collection is un@@ activated for the collection , it will be activated in opening the temporary collection , when the collection will continue to be added . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click here .
you can select the order that are played in the songs . if you select a series of men@@ tions , select the songs in the sequence , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove any one or random order in the menu , the order will be specified .
to record a song , select it in the collections managers , or use the selection list about the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , next next song from the menu or press the key arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button in the piece , the entry was fore@@ seen from the menu or press the key arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , choose the collection and cli@@ cking on the button .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter if they are stored at the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is necess@@ arily needed for synth@@ esizer which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events will be translated into events that uses the synth@@ esizer .
for example you can create a MIDI @-@ Map which conver@@ ts all events of the type change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always a trumpet sound , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all Sound@@ card GM compatible are ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US maps , FM -@@ devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there is no programmes to create MIDI maps . you must have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite singer ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that require all necessary requirements for the play of a piece of a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . the pre@@ condition is , however , that each recording have a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
define PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END define KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of key@@ map &quot; ... END define KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; ... END define CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END options ... END
you see that define it is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and END , that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail to do so in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not compatible with General MIDI @-@ MIDI .
in this section , as specified as the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard are depic@@ ted . the general use looks like :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation is ig@@ no@@ red . it is thought that the GM @-@ patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all tones used to lay down the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is supported by the sound ( e.g. sound 60 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which allows you to create a pistol net . this is the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is playing with patch 127 ( cloth sur@@ plus ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the clay 60 , regardless of which sound is at the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Dr@@ ums patch included patch included in which each tone is a different percussion instruments ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that means the clay pitch of the same drum means ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify as sounds at a certain canal or instrument . the use is :
as described by the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as their predecess@@ ors . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define for each channel and instrument several ke@@ ym@@ ers . you must use only in the first line of different names .
Ke@@ ym@@ ye are all used to tra@@ inees at the per@@ cus@@ sions @-@ channel tra@@ inees . look for example the supplied ke@@ ym@@ ers .
this section can be used to tra@@ inees some channels down to other tra@@ inees . if you want to make the first and second channel , make it easy to make this very easy at CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
N is the channel , which is used on the channel N is used . if you are using the key@@ map option , if you are using the Key@@ map option , all events will ign@@ ore the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to use always the per@@ cus@@ sions @-@ patch on the per@@ cus@@ sions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio gives to be multip@@ lied by the pitch ben@@ der events . if a MIDI file sen@@ ds off with the value n , this is converted with the formula ( r / 4096 ) and then the value is 4096 , thus in the Map @-@ file ( as dec@@ imal number ) .
this setting is used because GM gives out a keyboard that is a pitch ben@@ der event . unfortunately , but try some key@@ boards for two sounds up to one oct@@ ave . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use an MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings
the se@@ wer view is a window with a full range of cav@@ ities ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) . on this way , you can see that sounds are only played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain canal . for each channel there is a evaluation level , where you have changed a instrument , ligh@@ tens the button not more green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the se@@ wer view ( until now ) has two different views to display the interpre@@ t tones . view the settings below the point channel view : settings
the pace LCD displays the speed to be played with a song . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. you can find a song to follow the text , you can slow down to the text , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it , like a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhyth@@ m , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices to very different results , the same as two different musicians can play on very different ways .
good , I can ni@@ hil@@ ated z@@ win@@ gen , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . however , a typical MIDI file requires a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; they have control over all .
this may happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , DE@@ B ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have been compiled . to solve this problem , you need to download a source distribution and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole file to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files .
to be understood , so it supports &amp; k@@ mid , drag &amp; drop . open the file that you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , activ@@ ating the collection of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can claim the arrow button on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard speed , you can click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ le ; -@@ working area a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way I would like to play if the collection is at the end or I want to play a file , merely go to the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to change and the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you don &apos;t want to listen to a file , if you add just a file , put the setting of automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be published to the temporary collection .
supp@@ ose you have to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . not only want to play the first file . so you will set the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then do you complete , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all thanks ! when I see these songs or the postcard , animated me to program on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ros@@ a.@@ J@@ imen@@ ez ; from Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; lag@@ a . at the moment , I am not much free time for my ho@@ b@@ bies , but I try to take a bit time for my ho@@ b@@ bies , but I try to make a bit time . as a ho@@ b@@ bies I program to make music files , music and sets .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me a e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a giant friend if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file , I will send a postcard or a MIDI file , but you should receive a MIDI file , but should I contact with me , as I may have the file perhaps already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my leisure and out of ni@@ em@@ an@@ ted for this money . I would therefore have to programming , because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ ma@@ ils ) .

animation of the start and don@@ ations can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify by &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activ@@ ate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; files can be ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / share .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / Ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
animation of the Start does not need to be brief , it will end automatically through the opening of another source . this would be imp@@ acted at the end of animation , the user can therefore end the application for a second time .
an easy example of a start @-@ animation displays the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; im@@ g procedure = &quot; in@@ defin@@ ite &quot; src = &quot; in@@ defin@@ ite ; &amp; lt ; / bod@@ y@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / bod@@ y@@ gt ; in the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in tests / some examples of S@@ MIL the von &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing the player in configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can get the path from the player and the intermediate memory size from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting , the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the release of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this re @-@ dispens@@ ing in configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be config@@ ured through manual processing of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . this is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played in &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it &apos;s even the special field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be re@@ printed , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service providers for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash using the assign@@ ments of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is described in a con@@ soles to start and after error reports on the store of the browser module . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the text menu ) .
this is always a pre@@ y back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was determined ) , this must be done by manual change of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on can re@@ give all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; may be used by TV maps , either by using the player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV this can be config@@ ured to use the device and the TV channels can be used manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data records ) in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog appears under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . you should be found ports to be selected from which one is chosen . that can be used to use it ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably contain a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of dis@@ playing video devices under Linux is only supported . this is also , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension refers to the X server must therefore be function@@ ing in his configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

just like other training languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction with which the gener@@ ous properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and tex@@ ture to be specified with the text . the introduction after the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } .
the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a handy function for fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some requirements for creating document . there are also some of which can be performed on the document .
document : this is the type of document ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; Report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ am@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , projector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : here the character enc@@ oding of the system should be used . modern systems use the UTF @-@ 8 enc@@ oding as default . at best , UTF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing and lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
these list contains the most commonly used external pack@@ ers for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the integration , they are only to be able to rise only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , document ( DIN ) : the document can be used by Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the text of German texts .
new users that are not wor@@ ry now . it is just a short description of functions and further information will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source language files , the high@@ ligh@@ ted in the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . if you notice that any math@@ emati@@ cal environments is not closed . however , it will notice that any math@@ emati@@ cal environments is nevertheless noticed . however , it will be noticed by the mod@@ est appearance of the output file . however , you will save you by the emph@@ asis .
with the automatic adjustment of the environments , the command is generated by command of a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { orders } ) . this function can be activated automatically ( e.g. \ \ end { orders } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the men@@ tions ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are divided into some elements . &amp; Latex ; about the sub@@ division of the document within the following elements ( part is the heav@@ iest and sub@@ cut@@ ters the lowest element ) :
with the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed by a mouse click to the respective and wat@@ ched .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created , the return file can be created . once a DVI ; file the file has been created , navig@@ ating and k@@ ile ; by one click with the average mouse button in DVI ; viewer viewer for the respective line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and other information such as the font server and also other information about the font type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion , and to print of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the Ré@@ gi@@ ble search engine , the elements of the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked on a item in the DVI ; file source code is the exact opposite of it . once you cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the respective place in the DVI ; viewer viewer .
Master @-@ document : this function is simplified with several files . with a master document , the work will be simplified with other ein@@ bound .@@ tex -@@ files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set .
Quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the results automatically appear ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
file transfer : in this mode the DVI ; file to Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ un@@ gen@@ â ( Ar@@ cher ) , and it takes place a call of &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; after quick installation .
in consider@@ ation of the working tool bar should be developed , the selection areas were developed for the fast evaluation of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... The per@@ missions and lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the optional field of further information is available for articles such as Tags , Fu@@ Ã , notes or references . the information is available :
name : with this command , a designation is created for a section , a picture or a different element .
cover : used for reference to a set of set ( select a selection box ) .
if the quote from quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries . the author has good experience with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files you can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last evaluation box with the name Gra@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for the laying of the font bar for the main text , the Fu@@ ties and notes etc. are specified . there are the following font names to be used :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection committee on the creation of a new document through sel@@ ecting the document type and soli@@ ds of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand by hand .
the stap@@ les after the command \ \ state class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specif@@ ies the font bar . the font is not defined at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code example was entered by means of lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled . the eas@@ iest way to this is the use of the unit building or of the button .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for stor@@ ing the storage automatically .
Keychain det@@ ects the document should be found in the log file according to the errors , should be started automatically . for use by Quick construction should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be not@@ ified .
a environment ( English Environment ) is a text that is completely treated as the remaining document . for example , the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } , \ \ H@@ uge and \ \ end { Environment } ex@@ presses the author of the scri@@ be in the vicinity - E@@ enk@@ ni@@ â ( engl@@ . H@@ uge ) .
the other changes will only be used within the environment ( of \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } to \ \ end { Environment } ) . there is no restri@@ ction ( number ) for changes within a environment .
there are many possibilities for appreci@@ ation of the document and user fri@@ endl@@ iness of document . there are certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , under@@ lying , etc . these commands are either full with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the surroundings .
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ t } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is closed while until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ t } or another environment . one single word may be depic@@ ted with \ \ val@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote on the document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background the writing of the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; presentation language is shown , now follows a step @-@ in @-@ step @-@ Guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the assistant , a bit text should be entered into a bit text , a few adjust@@ ments for the better reading of the document should be fulfilled , some places in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a po@@ em to come to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed to return via editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E again ( for internal consider@@ ation ) . for an external viewer , the window will be closed to the window .
once the DVI ; file is printed , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply test and work .
DVI ; is a straight file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers in the computer . there are many different types of .@@ dv@@ i -@@ edition as pr@@ inters , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after cli@@ cking on DVI , the document can be printed using file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar ex@@ changeable the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; Latex ; -@@ Source Text was created , the conversion can begin in certain other formats by the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preliminary @-@ search yiel@@ ds direct jump from editor to da@@ un@@ locked position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex . for this , only modern under adjust@@ ments must be al@@ located ... Tools Building seating .
in order to carry out the preliminary search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a row of the source by the source , and then click on tem@@ plates . the jump to the respective place in the DVI ; panel viewer is then sod@@ ann .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; added ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; as text editor will be specified as text editor ( Settings ... Editor )
should not be displayed when using the quick @-@ release of the &amp; DVI ; panel viewer is a mistake , this should be displayed in the log file or in the news window .
the log file util@@ izes the error source in source code . in the editor then the button extension refers to the error . in order to consider the faul@@ ty line , needs to be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file , navig@@ ating to the faul@@ t@@ less line .
once the respective button in the tool@@ bar is cli@@ cked , a window will be used to use the document of the use of the document . the pre @-@ produced systems are :
with a selection of empty document , a document can be used either from the ground or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
rigid users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly the same introduction for almost all documents . tem@@ plates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and re@@ loaded to create creating a new document .
to create a new template , it must be created either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or created a new file via existing document to create an existing document and sel@@ ecting the document on document ... create .
when creating a new document to create a new document , some strings through other data will be replaced by other data ( such as name or character enc@@ oding ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... settings are generally adjusted .
when creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know what variables of which variables will be replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by the entry in documents . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ de@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the eas@@ iest way to create a template &apos;s use is the use of the wiz@@ ard and so that the document can be created on this way as soon as the document should be accompl@@ ished :
when creating a new document , the own template instead of the default can be balanced .
a fore@@ igner can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be prepared . a simple way to produce a template , should be searched for one in the Internet and are kept under described steps .
&amp; Kate ; used &amp; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programming and high@@ ways of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many adjust@@ ments for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its toll was to learn the manual for Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; here you can start right with the reading of the Capital &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; safety command , which can be called for the Men@@ tion La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use , as well as their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with pressed Ctr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way click the click to \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p .
when drawing the text with ge@@ dr@@ Ã ¼ ck left mouse button , the selected text is automatically cop@@ ied into the intermediate shelf .
for use of the arrow , with a maximum key moment button of the source tex@@ ture in the editing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; it has the highest types of source texts to brow@@ se and these are em@@ brac@@ ed . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the math@@ emati@@ cal form@@ ul@@ as are high@@ ligh@@ ted by another colour .
many assistant custom@@ iz@@ ations contained in the text . this is an own kind of Bookmark the text , or the corresponding key of the jump , or last explo@@ res . thus , this explo@@ res are high@@ ligh@@ ted , so that it is automatically exp@@ elled at the first input of a drawing .
the work is probably one of the main asp@@ ects in the program of a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; important functions for the writing of an &amp; Latex ; source texts always offers many environments and groups and therefore under@@ scores ; special commands for their choice . under review , the following commands are provided to text selection :
if you have a complete section ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . this advanced significance does not include a text with a good text ( like in other text editor ) . this advanced thing is in &amp; k@@ ile ; it is so that the eff@@ usions are separated by two empty lines .
if the word stands out under the current c@@ urs@@ or@@ position . this selection also has a extended importance as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a extra strong star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end of the year .
for example of a part of the document can be nat@@ to be removed from this first . &amp; Kate ; the button extension Ctr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands . under editing the following commands are included :
remov@@ es a complete section . the definition for a section in &amp; k@@ ile ; it is contained in the description of process offices .
it has already been clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under ass@@ work environment for easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected for the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor will be placed directly before the command to the ambient conditions .
this command is inj@@ ected to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the ambient temperature of the surrounding area .
if the c@@ ursor up or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } is located to the end of the environment ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
at the input of many det@@ ach@@ able environmental commands can be lost quickly by the vision of the details . this command does not reach the last ambient conditions , so that the det@@ ach@@ ite environmental structure is not li@@ ged .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under the work Te@@ X @-@ Group are some important orders which correspon@@ d to those from the environment .
this command is spec@@ kled on the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the shr@@ ine clamp .
with this command will be spec@@ kled on the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the fl@@ ank signs .
if the c@@ ursor up or behind the mel@@ ted Kl@@ ammer is a &amp; tex ; group # is where the other end of the group is spec@@ kled ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
at the input of many wor@@ shi@@ ed groups , groups may reach the vision of the details . this command is the last gro@@ unded group that the shi@@ fted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups may not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple signs for the purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple approach will be used . even for the end of the inc@@ ision , the sign is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for gr@@ ab@@ dic@@ ts , for &amp; lat@@ ex .
this automatic entry for the double respon@@ ses can be used under adjust@@ ments ... La@@ Te@@ X and be switched off .
there are also numerous other languages ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French . there are also many more languages supported .
when shi@@ fting Shift ; input ter &amp; k@@ ile ; a smart line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ surroundings ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ice ) , not only a line breaks , but also at the command \ \ item at the same time .
within a tables , typ@@ ing &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an acc@@ ust@@ y line breaks off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; it is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ installed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under adjust@@ ments ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
some user assem@@ b@@ lies the columns into tables -@@ issues and all the Et characters ( amp ; ) sub@@ jected to each other . while the table is not associated with it ; even after the most sustain@@ ed tab@@ ulator in the following row . although this table is not assigned to the columns position of the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; this is already a good source code util@@ ization , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still expanded . all these modes are used for automatic contam@@ ination . all these modes are set up for different work under adjust@@ ments ... con@@ stra@@ igh@@ tening .
at the beginning of a new environment with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { area } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
the final letter of the Ré@@ serv@@ ings will be removed by the final letter of the entrance . the list is due to the full extension list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , while loading rates are removed , so that just jump to these positions by means of spra@@ ying jum@@ per brand , and the desired parameters can be entered .
under Settings / ile ; setting ... k@@ ile ; complete adjust@@ ments for these lists . there are various types of numbers for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as result of the general voice of use .
the command mode is not provided for the finishing of environments . however , there are always a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of the distribution mode is used . on the other hand , the environments is often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the finishing in environments is for har@@ vest@@ ing environments .
when calling the menu setting , the men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ zel Alt + switch moment button , the command to the place automatically stops and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in { . after that the ambient temperature is continued to ref@@ use and through pressu@@ res of the input button .
once again , the environment will be re@@ closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile it is recogni@@ zes that there is a lists ro@@ undings , even a lists \ \ item command is not used .
under Settings / ile ; setting ... k@@ ile ; adjust@@ ing settings for these lists . this mode uses the result list of full set mode for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; on custom lists of sections , which will be replaced immediately by l@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ere strings . if the lists can be used under adjust@@ ing file to the file ex@@ ample@@ .c@@ ab , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X are included .
for example , the code L is entered and the word compar@@ ative cancellation conditions for the men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ungs Ctr@@ l + Alt @-@ button , the letter will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large numbers are not helpful . however , it was noted that many W@@ ant in a document should be written more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete damage are already written for all .
this mode can be used in the men@@ tions ... K@@ ile align@@ ment needs to be locked . here , the threshold value for the ad is set to be specified .
the full length files can be installed in sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / k@@ ile / off / mode / the Per@@ sian Home folder . mode also stands for ab@@ bre@@ viation ( Ab@@ k@@ Ã ¼ r@@ usion ) , &apos; ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ usion ) or tex .
the graphics graphics solution is designed as simple as possible . for example , the bas@@ ics of the bas@@ ics are similar to the graph@@ ical information , sections and not@@ if@@ ies should be not@@ ice@@ ably .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but also offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . the PDF output is applied , so the pages are arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are updated and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file .
to help the result of the work must be compiled and must be compiled into the source code . all building tools are group@@ ed into the men@@ tions , creating re@@ boot and ex@@ positions .

script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the output of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scrip@@ ts can be administ@@ rated in the vertical bar .
the API scrip@@ ts are not yet developed and can be developed in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
the first must be said as the first to be said that the expansion of scrip@@ ts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system@@ ically significant object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite balanced system , in which the basic functions are expanded by a variety of extra packages , offers a lot of different positions to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tures ; are delivered with many documents . there are a documentation for the included pack@@ ets and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a full re@@ mot@@ ely re@@ mot@@ ely for &amp; Latex ; and s@@ ein@@ e@@ â ( Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â ) . here it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few key packages are described ) but rather , it is ideal for search for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided in &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important signs .
due to the quantity of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tures ; ex@@ trad@@ ited the final document is not always simple . as m@@ Ã ¶ g@@ ent help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ ture , the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k to be delivered and delivered for a graph@@ ical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the grey advantage is the search for p@@ act name or whi@@ che@@ ers . of &amp; k@@ ile , then only the results are shown .

often working on a project of several persons in a sort of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supported by the team members and these can be config@@ ured with Shift ; F7 project project features -@@ dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory . Nickname is the nickname of user and serves for the clear identification .
a member can have several cast@@ ors in the project , as well as sub @-@ sub @-@ Project leader .
the user can look for out of the list of team members that he is . this is done by winning the team member of the list , and the starter was pressed while the present member ( their Iden@@ ti@@ fication ) appears also fat after you are : text .
nickname and attitude of their own identity are important concerning the news and notes . see further information regarding notes .
besides the overview of her team there is another advantage by the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team manager if something special happens . see also on more detailed information .
event events are actions that are carried out when something is defined in the project . an example would like to sign up the opening and closing of the project , as much someone worked , or a script that will play a file into the CV@@ S , once they will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F7 project project settings dialog can be created , processed and deleted .
an email will be sent to the reci@@ pi@@ ent in the receiver &apos;s list of selected addresses . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such lad@@ der can be established .
notes are special comments in documents . they di@@ ffer to normal comments on the following things :
NOTE the notes is simple . it can be selected either the Editor @-@ text in the editor @-@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comm@@ uter area followed by edit@@ orial notes .
ann@@ ot@@ ation can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the nickname of team member states ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) , part director of leaders , Sub@@ project leader after the en@@ rich@@ ment and sub@@ project leaders , should be led to the corresponding or sub@@ project name , as shown in the following examples below .
nickname and roll@@ ers names are independ@@ ently of large - or small description , but spaces around the brackets and the note : make the note .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ ations , the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic is and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ts languages supported .
the settings are easily accessible via the settings . here , only about &amp; quant@@ itative ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description of the areas can be found in .
the settings can be access@@ ed by adjust@@ ments Qu@@ anta to be called . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ itative ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . entries are :
great / hard @-@ case of tags : large / Klein@@ ger@@ ation of automatically entered the tags . normal Big / Classi@@ fication means that tags are inserted so inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
attri@@ butes big / Klein@@ ger@@ ation of attri@@ butes : large / Klein@@ ger@@ ation of automatically entered the attri@@ butes . normal Big / Klein@@ ger@@ ation means that attri@@ butes are so inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if used , is used for tags that is optional for the final day , that is immediately after &amp; gt ; added .
not optional tags : as above for all the other tags except the simple tags .
start@@ up and update day automatically : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic set of Akzent @-@ character : controls the conversion of ac@@ centr@@ alized characters into the corresponding coding during the inser@@ tion .
MIME type : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . using the default standard , the default settings can be re@@ produced .
standard character enc@@ oding : the coding of newly created or in other mode open files ( where the coding of the file can be exceeded ) , but this setting is charged from the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
default D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is not used for newly created files or for files , whose D@@ TD is not recognized . this setting will be completed by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup cop@@ ie : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; created regularly cir@@ clip or crash when the program can be removed from this backup . this is not the same as the memory of the file . also for not stored documents , a backup regularly is created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in editing or own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ ons ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , the preview and the source code simultaneously .
set the window settings on the standard back when the user interface is useful , if the user interface through changing the M@@ DI Mod@@ i and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on the views each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout of command line parameters .
the warning messages -@@ area serves the possibility of adding warning lights through the hook of non more review .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be specified in the display of symbols in instead of scrip@@ ts , as such as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code samples in the divided mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser no@@ de in the document , in detail .
in the area click on the structural tree , the following promotion is possible to change the structural bau@@ mes with the mouse button .
in the structural tree settings , the vis@@ ibility of no@@ de in tree , can be opened automatically at a change of structural tree automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found in which the current document is found .
the area for stor@@ ages of ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations ( a kind of tem@@ plates ) , which can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , each can be divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it may be valid for PHP , in which the if@@ ications occurs slightly different means than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be administ@@ rated . plug @-@ ins are used by third side , which can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , best @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting plug must be specified :
address : the path to plug@@ in if it is not in a standard location as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
entry : this information will be handed in to the plug@@ in when it can open the current file , the respective file ( path of the current file ) or the Project file .
component in &quot; Just read &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in must ref@@ use the store . only by reading K@@ Parts , usually the store , if this option is not elected .
check out the plug@@ in : if it is activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the displayed information is correct . if the plug@@ in at the moment not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ itative ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting has been completely re@@ designed . Die@@ ugger for the non @-@ necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ugger that was implemented as also the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ugger . instead of its debut a deb@@ ugger plug concept , which enables various implem@@ entations using plug @-@ in .
currently only one plug@@ in is available , added support for use &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; added .
the use of the deb@@ ugger for a project begins with the selection of an appropriate deb@@ ugger plug in the project settings . using the Deb@@ ugger plug@@ in selection list , the specific settings can be changed .
if a project is activated for an deb@@ ugger that some additional elements are available in &amp; quant@@ itative ; -@@ GU@@ I interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of monitoring variables . appears normally at the left Do@@ ck .
a view , in which all durability , with line numbers and conditions are listed . appears normally at the bottom Do@@ ck .
a view that is shown in the issue ( as in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . appears normally at the bottom Do@@ ck .
depending on the supported features of the deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything is or a part of the following functionality .
with this action , the connection to Deb@@ ugger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des plug@@ in to the plug@@ in requirements . this promotion is opened by default if a project is open , that it must not be executed in the normal case .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug session Star@@ te the session . includes the link to deb@@ ugger or finished the l@@ ute to the requirements .
sen@@ ds a HTTP request to the server to run a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this request is shown in the deb@@ ugger edition .
the deb@@ ugger that began to start with the execution of the script and the current line , if this is done , the version is continued when the script was begun , the script will start with the requirements .
the deb@@ ugger that is to begin with the execution of the script , without information regarding monitoring variables and the current line number , if this is done while a script has been given , the version starts once a request is completed .
the deb@@ ugger leads to the next statement in the script , without added to the functions or includes .
the deb@@ ugger will introduce the next statement in the script , whereby it is possible when possible in functions and includes a includes .
the deb@@ ugger that goes to the statement and go to the next date , the current is not to go .
opens a dialogue , in which a variable or expression can be entered , the monitoring value is to be monit@@ ored in the numer@@ als view .
this dialog can be entered into a variable , or a new value of a variable .

document type edit packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ itative ; used to provide support for marking and sk@@ ri@@ pt@@ ors . your simp@@ licity and flexibility makes from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web@@ developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the scrip@@ ts languages and the tool . day file contain two dat@@ at@@ yp@@ es , images , symbol@@ ise suffer@@ ings ( above the Ed@@ iti@@ er window ) , the text and instructions faster in a document as a user could ever be .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created ( see below ) , downlo@@ ad@@ able or automatically creates from an existing D@@ TD . see also for details to the conversion .
this document describes how the XML files are to create , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ rc ; and also tool@@ bars . shortly , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attri@@ butes for tags as well as the layout and the content of the Fe@@ atu@@ ities , the &amp; quant@@ itative data ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self @-@ tool sets a fast inser@@ tion tags in a document without a writing command .
day folders are nothing as a file . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ rc ; and the daily file files are the name of the writ@@ ings language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below list the elements of da@@ ys@@ s and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible to use a better view and more information at work with them .
the following chapters , each item is described in detail . all about the possibilities and bound@@ aries are depic@@ ted in a simple way .
that is the root element of a day @-@ document document . it can only contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains only a item @-@ element type over yourself .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only for the Type of the Type . there is the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ bute and attri@@ butes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( Family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Tag . this is an element type element .
this item is described a attri@@ bute of a Tags . this element can only contain only once for every attri@@ bute . it l@@ ays the name and type of the attri@@ bute . in addition , there are more tags to describe as this attri@@ bute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an element type of element .

is the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements which may occur within the defin@@ itive tags . this element is an element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
all day XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enc@@ oding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at@@ ted and closed .
empty marks have nothing but look up &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ at@@ st@@ his &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would dis@@ appear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog appears above in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to launch and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select another dialog appears to follow its easy instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , chec@@ king only in the load XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us store .
in the following example , for a family of 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file is Sh@@ em@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file is described in this file . fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ . day .

the &amp; file rc ; -@@ file is also fair@@ ly simple and there is an editor that can be easily access@@ ed via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; can be processed for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; quant@@ itative ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD option . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) - The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a Nickname .
a action can be fixed with settings ... to be created . click New Action on the same dialog :
this promotion is assigned key . with click the user button , you can be assigned a key pl@@ um@@ ble ; with K@@ einer is the current key pl@@ um@@ bly removed .
the eas@@ iest action . can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the promotion , this text is inserted into the current C@@ ursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful shareholders . with the help of these action , external applications can be started ( usually scrip@@ ts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quant@@ itative ; yourself are the quick@@ start -@@ dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed to use the % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ . this way is suggested to use the % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ . on this way : global script file : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / scrip@@ ts in their path : $ PA@@ TH . there are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the UR@@ L of the current document . in case of local document file : / from the document name .
% PID : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; quant@@ itative ; -@@ process will be replaced . if by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this text is unique to the PID number , this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control the control of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the external script will be used .
the parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the en@@ um@@ b@@ ated methods , a script input of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can take part in the standard entry . in the evaluation level can be determined to send the default values . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the application can also be di@@ ver@@ ted . there are two types : normal output , which is written down to the default edition . it can be specified , which is set up to the default issue , by the value that the evaluation level is set to :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create any group of own tool@@ bar . in particular case it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
as soon as a tool bar is added , you must add action and con@@ figure . choose the settings .
the parts of this fan are fair@@ ly self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts the edit mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add the day to the matching tool bar .
complete all and if the day attri@@ butes and you are planning , activ@@ ate dialogue &quot; day , &quot; when available , adding a input while action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is the tiny symbol . who should consider the action in conjunction with this icon ? replace it before we have trouble .
for creating a symbol that the promotion is better represents , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics further programs ( or where else is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to understand what the action does , but also all the other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to that the day starts , I &apos;ve decided to create a start button as a symbol . due to the use of green ( green is usually regarded as un@@ dless , rigid , further interpre@@ ted ) , or should at least , a message for users can be entered ; -@@ per day in the current document will be entered .
according to the creation of symbol , it must be connected to the action . this happens over the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and choose the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
choose the file , in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK .
if you continue to push the button , press it with other tags , so there &apos;s still , or confirm with OK .
supp@@ ose you want to compl@@ ement some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; - functions to the tool@@ bar must be divided into several groups . open the tool@@ bars in several groups . open the tool@@ bars to set the tool@@ bar tool@@ bars . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ators ( left top ) for my tool@@ bar . after the selection of the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow request to the right . this adds the element to tool bar .
for example , I want to access a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Preview . I will select it and add to the tool bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ators wanted to support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ stit@@ ching all symbols to ensure that everything worked .
secure in the proper file . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right file , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right file . please adjust the tool bar ( s ) if a file is opened by the respective type .
perhaps the mentioned evaluation expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; Docum@@ ent@@ ation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; quant@@ itative ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory if any one has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search a exist@@ ent documentation for form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ rc file . the first part we have to leave you for the second .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # 1 , tag@@ e.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ n = tag@@ 2.@@ html day 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the section Tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentary section . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation here :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc = php@@ 42 / # top level elements , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = in@@ dex@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syn@@ tax , ... basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax .@@ html ...
NOTE the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . it shows that there are no known border with its own content . there is no known border for the chess compet@@ itions ( except through the ver@@ ge ) md@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
NOTE that the contents should not be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and is ad@@ vised at the upper end of the building view &amp; md@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
empty spaces influence nothing but look up &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Resour@@ ces@@ . files will be replaced .
the ingre@@ dient is the range of doc@@ rc file , which is for example when writing a &amp; PHP ; for example , when writing about Ctr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the text list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file binding files .
a simple list of using separate text elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ rc file and save up to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Apps / quant@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a file ( such as you have indicated this file doc@@ rc file as doc@@ rc file and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these good and it is worth , send your doc@@ rc files using a description of important information , such as documentation were used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; quant@@ itative ; -@@ community . they are not rich , but we are proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ itative ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scrip@@ ts , tem@@ plates ) with others . there are two ways to do that :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else which are sent . in different places there is an email message , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bars and folders in tem@@ plates and folders in tem@@ plates and scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be loaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them as correctly and useful for the publication . to signi@@ fying what a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key needs . thus , the source of resources guarantees , both for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are being asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can be completed in the dialog for a new resource ( UR@@ L preview can be empty ) and with click OK .
the up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to load tool bar tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the tem@@ plates and scrip@@ ts tree will be started .
after downlo@@ ading a resource , before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ itative ; the integr@@ ity of resource has been war@@ ned to notice . if the integr@@ ity is given and the resource can be signed correctly , a message appears with the author of the resource .
it is possible to work with XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the preparation can be needed to work by using a D@@ TE@@ P files . there is the eas@@ iest way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD option . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ um / d@@ te@@ p file .
! DO@@ C@@ TYPE Defin@@ itions : the string set in ! DO@@ C@@ TYPE Day , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTM@@ L4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after the conversion : if enabled , scores &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after the conversion of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P setup , which can be adjusted to use this option .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key designs . to understand these to understand and full advantage of &amp; quant@@ itative concepts . this chapter attemp@@ ts to give them exactly these concepts , without understanding &amp; quant@@ itative ; little benefits are brow@@ ned .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , loc@@ ally and projection . this differenti@@ ation concerns a range of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; are available . from tool@@ bars over actions , everything is marked , in the common file @-@ structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administ@@ rators to secure machine , actions and samples in the global tree , which can be available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of Web@@ Develop@@ ments for a single user . these are custom@@ ized patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , allowing them to use only this user .
project related elements are available within a certain project . that can be set up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a certain project . all elements are set in the lower part of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : editing window , the construction views , the box points with info and the tool@@ bars . please turn in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click the key figures with the right mouse button to obtain a con@@ text menu with the current document valid@@ ation , such as close by current , other or all card tr@@ acking , download or upload document to the current document .
rec@@ orders in the editing range lead to another accounts of docum@@ ent@@ ally , such as basic processing step ( add / copy / Insert ) , arrangement of under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file , if the string is called under the mouse po@@ inter .
at the top of the Ed@@ itors of Ed@@ itors . currently &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional is being shown as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to include one day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; in their document , then you can add the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert the data for this just the attri@@ butes ( such as anchor ) , then you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the building view ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navig@@ ate into the information &amp; quant@@ itative information ; to navig@@ ate them to opening and to pass through map material , project , patterns , document structure , scrip@@ ts , attri@@ butes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that presents &amp; quant@@ itative files . this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing files in the project using a right mouse click . actions like adding , remov@@ ing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting of the memory media can be carried out with the then expanded console menu .
another option of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of tem@@ plates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program components , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all options open .
tem@@ plates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category hang@@ s from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ working area . global tem@@ plates are always available , local tem@@ plates are only usable for the corresponding user and tem@@ plates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ts . the concept of the recording in Global , Lok@@ al and Project will also be available here . by cli@@ cking with the left mouse button you can download the available information on a script file , such as the script will start to work or send an email .
with this view shows the internal structure of active document . by links @-@ Click , the c@@ ursor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ Click , a list of command in terms of navigation and collection of building .
this tree appears under the other construction views . with him , man@@ fast attri@@ butes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . all the attri@@ butes for all available attri@@ butes with few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation for Web technology for your development . you can download documentation here and quant@@ itative documentation for &amp; quant@@ itative ; of the quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; document can create your documentation , and by adding a Ord@@ ner doc at a project can be reviewed and considered to be seen .
by default , &amp; quant@@ itative ; two cart@@ ons at the lower end of the window , can be reached on the lower end of the window , the news window and the problem window .
for example , this cart@@ ons shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running sk@@ ri@@ pt . for example , the current D@@ TD is shown above the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this cart@@ ons shows all error in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ itative ; -@@ scrip@@ ts that are executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . Show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the possibility of tool@@ bars is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an email . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sen@@ ds the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a tool bar in an email , they can secure this in &amp; quant@@ itative ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files to your system will be used . in order to get a complete list of all options , enter . / con@@ figure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and are not executed here .
if you have problems when starts from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ le ; 3 bin file . also , you should make sure that no el@@ derly version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PA@@ TH lies on their own folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a rapid web development , combined with a variety of powerful features .
during the effort , the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an ob@@ vious idea : what would be , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an excep@@ tionally , ext@@ endable web development tools for &amp; k@@ le ; so it was done so .
not longer to clean &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now it is far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tools . if you can in &amp; XML ; then it should be in &amp; XML ; it should be suitable for suitable &amp; IDE ;
well , to be ordered to the above claim that the idea is based on the outstanding effort of entire &amp; k@@ de ; development business is based on the outstanding effort of free software , the idea of why the development is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables users to boost the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand its productivity due to self @-@ level actions , scrip@@ ts and tool@@ bars , the automation can increase by using a sk@@ ri@@ pt@@ ens@@ able syn@@ tax . ( more about them find them in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed to create a fast web development and developed quickly to a sophist@@ icated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is linked to a commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ itative ; linked to the original developer , the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details about the individual documentation is with help : / quant@@ itative ( either this UR@@ L in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / quant@@ um exec@@ uting ) .
&amp; quant@@ a ; is currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ ential @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a fast access list from files you have opened . this list is changed anyway , if you open a file , which is not found on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
that allows you to save code parts and all files as tem@@ plates for later use . look at the section on tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / Project Management System , only a mistake will be reported .
convert special characters to &amp; HTML ; it contained special characters for the &amp; HTML ; -@@ sch@@ olar@@ ships , so that they are displayed correctly and not to be understood by the browser as form@@ ati@@ fication .

shows the symbols of symbols from the main window . this column allows you to set the Bookmark with a mouse click .
if you are using the current file , they will appear in menu along with entries of previous or neigh@@ bour , depending on the position of c@@ ursor in the document .
the book@@ ends via other documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
opens a exist@@ ent project from the hard disk . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us projects ; projects will be saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
a dialog to insert Files into the current project . the selected files will be cop@@ ied into the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory according to new files that could be there . it enables to copy graphics files in your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have additional inputs / output module ( K@@ IO sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project man@@ ages . in the chapter &amp; quant@@ itative ; -@@ projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : loc@@ ally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool bar . these can only be added to the names . actions must be stored via settings ... and they are asked to store the tool@@ bars , whether you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remov@@ es a tool@@ bar from the window range . that del@@ etes it not from the hard disk . if you don &apos;t have the tool bar not stored , you are asked if you want to do that .
thus , you can send their own tool@@ bar at someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , thus the tool@@ bar will be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as an@@ nex .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where each other can access it . see in .
Download a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you can &apos;t have any other , and convert any other than to &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own compl@@ aints format .

check the syn@@ tax of the current document on the selected &amp; D@@ TD by using the external application .
immediate change@@ over between the different types of user interface . thanks to some limit@@ ations in the K@@ DE libr@@ aries , the der@@ ail@@ le@@ ur may cause time or un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended that the default setting is , or the window mode , the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier versions .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for any open window . with a selection of entries will be activated by the appropriate window .
switches the status of status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us at the lower edge of the center .
the changes in this dialog presses any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ brow@@ s@@ ers .
the behaviour of the editing is an . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; one finds details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and change the sequences .
this should produce a help with the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with each Open Source Project the developers can always help . if they want to support the quant@@ itative form of financial form , you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory and should be completed the best from top to bottom , since B. after the fill of the project called the entire direc@@ tories for the rest of the project , all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . at the input of Name will be automatically filled out .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ itative ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces using the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine where you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ ample@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings of the chosen log could be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote invo@@ ice could be necessary .
this is the file where the tem@@ plates are stored for the project . it is a relative path for the project and by default tem@@ plates . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this file should be set instead of the standard .
this is the file to be stored in the tool@@ bars for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this file should be set instead of the standard .
it allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . several files or whole file can be selected .
this setting is great if you have a static web content you can download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ side script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you must go differ@@ ently .
check @-@ out if files that are located somewhere in the main event of the project , where a project is started ane@@ w , not comment .
using this option , all files and folders will appear within the main folder and you can catch a precise selection of good .
this shows a list of files in the main ord@@ ner . you can select the desired files by hook or , through remov@@ ing the hooks , stap@@ les from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant includes three adjust@@ ments which allows you to simp@@ lif@@ y your work . this settings can be changed in the menu space in the menu space in the lower window profiles or with the key @-@ down Shift ; F7 .
some settings are described in the project assistant , and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ ename ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) which will be re @-@ read with projects such as the project folder .
added option to the above , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded at the opening of the project . in addition , more than projection the project can be read .
thus only G@@ ub@@ ed can be selected to the deb@@ ugger . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ugger plug@@ in can be set with the button . in case the error search is described .
in the window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set up as the display of a building view for each profile , by calling a own building view for each profile .
in the window team configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see in detail .
in the window event configuration , one might change event actions and change these actions , change or delete . event transactions will be carried out if a certain event occurred , as about the si@@ ckle of a file . see in detail .
by default , quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project was opened . this behavior is currently not able to influence .
to open a different project , select the project ... from the menu Project or the Symbol Open Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project is displayed and allowed the selection of project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be automatically stored . you will be asked if you want to back any changes ahead , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; modified files . same happens if you invite a new project .
the project management provides free access to the files in the project . there may be the files in the current project .
file characteristics are equally , however , the entries must be open and open with the right mouse button :
here you can find different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of up@@ loaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current prof@@ ils . if only a profile is present , the button is bl@@ ind@@ ed to prevent remov@@ ing distances .
the password will keep in the core memory and your option is useful if you need to store files if the frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather un@@ secure password on the record option is not taken into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ end profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded on different server . at work or creation of a prof@@ ils , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server , to copy the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( loc@@ ally ) and n@@ fs .
port for the transfer . normally this must not be changed , except the network administ@@ rator has not running a service on the usual port .
depending on your att@@ ach@@ able function , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . if your password will be stored on the plate so that it cannot be read , but each with programming language can see it easy to see it .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple di@@ vers , can be loaded , and replace the current files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the menu or the project tool bar , accessible via the settings of the tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ itative ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjust@@ ments to &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to own design .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are designed in the best over the tool@@ bars . use and Add to adding tool@@ bars below in the section of tool@@ bars below .
the tool@@ bars and symbols will be set to be created by using a text@@ iles menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , you can ren@@ ame other actions such as tool bar , tool@@ bar , ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog , where can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the Con@@ text menus to a tool@@ bar ( symbol ) in addition to a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries must remove this promotion and action , which are self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in menu with Settings tool@@ bars and set settings ..
tem@@ plates are in the essential document ch@@ ases , code es@@ cal@@ opes and files to link . &amp; quant@@ itative file system with enhanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system existing directory within the board . tem@@ plates are in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restri@@ ctions that allows for the file system .
some with &amp; quant@@ itative ; included prec@@ ed@@ stocks have conditions for their use . please read the conditions before using the conditions before use .
binary is everything that is not the pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any text except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary layers are inserted in documents using im@@ g src / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre@@ set under global tem@@ plates . further information to the tem@@ plates are available .
documents can be created by any text document type . based on this tem@@ plates , new documents can be created . normally a simple framework for the purpose and organised the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the board tree under global tem@@ plates . see more information on tem@@ plates .
this type tem@@ plates is useful if not a new document will be inserted into the document , but the same text area always should be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system to Jav@@ as@@ cript or per@@ l basis . some examples are listed in the board tree under global tem@@ plates . see also for more information about the tem@@ plates .
as the name suggest@@ s , these tem@@ plates for all websites as tem@@ plates . they are a collection of several documents that can be organised in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us in a compressed tar archive .
create a document structure to taste ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File Report as a local template ....
as soon as it is done , you will notice that ( even if it was stored as a project licence ) , it is not visible in the project tree . look at the st@@ ep@@ tics under project conditions .
select text in your document and click on file as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be pul@@ led with pul@@ ling and lay down on the construction supervision .
the creation of binary tem@@ plates is simple : to copy the file only to a system folder . all file administ@@ ered functions can be used , e.g. draw and dep@@ end or Insert over the file tree by Kon@@ quer@@ or .
one can select in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder and secure site template , secured a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be stored as local or global in@@ lay .
project conditions allow a very targeted approach . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ics with &amp; PHP ; additionally , add files or associated with them . in addition , one can keep some things for use in projects very low in mind in projects .
the setup structure in the window is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Apps / quant@@ um / tem@@ plates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Apps / quant@@ um / tem@@ plates . each of this file corresponds to one of four types of containers , as described above .
to define the behavior of a folder hand in the template table with the right mouse button on the folder and select the text @-@ menu properties . the following dialog appears :
an evaluation box with the three previously described types ; files , text or tem@@ plates . this selection is low as soon as a result attri@@ butes ver@@ sen@@ ed .
this is activated by default and fits for everything except the family gather@@ ers in the template . if a regular folder would be explic@@ it@@ ly de@@ activ@@ ate , unless it would be explic@@ it@@ ly activated . in case of a normal file , the Bl@@ ah would appear with something like this text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you can probably be in a family ord@@ ner .
allowed pre @-@ set or re@@ produced text for tem@@ plates in this file . that could be general head@@ lines and foot@@ lines for all tem@@ plates in a file with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
additionally , you also have con@@ text menu ( shown on the right mouse button ) via a complete source collection for adding folder or copy and paste of tem@@ plates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second , the editing window will be replaced in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites you a document as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor appears . then you can edit and when needed to the source code editor in which the implemented changes in the V@@ PL ; editor is visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; it shows a small symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ en@@ its of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit these directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this compar@@ atively .
the second mode just like the first , except that at the same time , the changes in source text editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is activated and the C@@ ursor in source code is activated in the V@@ PL ; editing the key @-@ pressure of the active C@@ ursor of a window to others , whereby the position is ret@@ ained in document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . -@@ view can be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in the selection , the period can be set automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be used for fast computer and a large chip for slow PC .
supp@@ ose , you want to select the title of the website , such is the presentation of invisible tags in work with the V@@ PL ; editing is also called , once a new document can be created with the V@@ PL ; Editor . that is the device of the hanging code . thus , you can change the following :
Met@@ a tags st@@ ates the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. impact words for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two switching surfaces below or removed . one click on the list enables change to the contents of content , such as keywords in the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new path of the design of the view of the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change of the list is just like the Met@@ a elements . the work of CSS Rules will not be supported yet .
it is possible to create a external CSS installation , by adding to the file button and cho@@ oses the appropriate file .
the use of c@@ urs@@ ors is as usual in a word @-@ processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the mark@@ ings works as usual . text can be inserted into inserted and using the button or removal key .
the tags of tags will be made in the same way above the tool@@ bars , as in source text editor , it is not removed if a anchor day , surrounded by text must be sur@@ round with text , each other supp@@ os@@ ing an@@ ker can be removed .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the lists @-@ Assist@@ ent are de@@ activated . they will not work on &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , tables or lists are to be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool to the examination of styles found . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ list@@ ings , search for specific elements can be followed , and execution of the style of style can be trac@@ ed .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; we need to comp@@ ile the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt , and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

there are many graphic tools for Compare . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain shortly , why I have written .
the merg@@ ing was very comp@@ lic@@ ated because one of the contri@@ but@@ ors had been carried out in many places . another programmer had changed in the same file . the result was numerous conflic@@ ts at merg@@ ing .
this program showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly is in these lines . and there was no evidence on the digits , where perhaps only the entry had changed . the merg@@ ing of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences in line and changes to white signs . later , any amount of useful features were added later .
if you like to compare this text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add him in one of the compar@@ ision window .
a function which made a lot of work was the Compare and merg@@ ing of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merg@@ es will be fully supported . this is useful , if two persons independent changes in one piece of code and visu@@ alize changes in the automatic file . the screenshot can even directly edit the expected result . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files at merg@@ ing :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you complete the Compare and merg@@ ing complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file merg@@ es :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and di@@ ffer for the possibilities of current color@@ im@@ s . if you &apos;re commonly ver@@ ify code , you will like to test this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed in a certain number of white signs , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no trou@@ bles changes more if no man changes the entry . )
if a file is equal , and the other diff@@ ers in a row , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files have the same names , but in different folders , you can make sure the typ@@ ing work easier to write only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 file gir@@ der k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 folder
the opening dialog allows manual transmission to file names , select the selection of file browser ( file ... ) or select one of the file open@@ ings . if you have any third file , if you have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be done .
if you select a file for the button ... you can also choose a file , if you receive a file , then use a file , then used for B and C , however , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other files .
if merg@@ ing is crossed , the input field is active for the goal . however , it is not necess@@ arily required to define immediately an output file . you can also use this step later in the stor@@ ing .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before starting with the Compare / merg@@ ing .
sometimes , you don &apos;t want to compare all the file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the intermediate shelf to the active compar@@ ision window . the comparison will start immediately . in the opening dialog you can &apos;t connect to the dialog easy using the breaking button .
you can also use pul@@ ling and dep@@ end : draw a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let him fall on a compar@@ ative window .
what thought is behind ? sometimes it contains a file e.g. several similar functions , if you want to figure out how much of these features would need to create it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load and then compare these functions . now you can easily add the relevant sections to copy , insert and then compare .
NOTE : currently you can &apos;t pull out anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the cover from text to a compar@@ ision window is supported .
warning : some edit the pul@@ ling and dep@@ loyment of text in another program as a cut and insert ( instead of copy and inser@@ tion ) . in such case , your original data might go lost .
in the upper part of each Text@@ ile window is the info line . the Info line contains the characters A , B or C , the file names and the line number of the first visible column in window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) you can rest the mouse a while on the line . then you will display the mouse to view the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . A has the colour blue , B and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed over the settings menu ) .
if a difference is detected , you can distingu@@ ish this file , the default colour is red . ( colour for conflic@@ ts in the settings ) , the colour scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s the next section ( merg@@ ing ) good to see .
in addition to the text , the enclosed column . when differences were found , the colour shows the corresponding colour . in some programming languages , the colour is not so important to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , B. , white signs are only relevant to character and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary column of text is interrup@@ ted in places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line is activated , the line is broken by broken lines .
the result @-@ window ( below the compar@@ ative windows ) also has a info line with the in@@ scription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; con@@ science &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it does already contain text , but often does it contain conflic@@ ts .
! ! ! until all conflict is dissolved , the stor@@ ing is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next sol@@ dered / UN@@ GE@@ DAN@@ CE conflict around the remaining conflict . )
if only two compar@@ ision windows are used , each difference is also to be solved at the same time as a conflict .
by one click on the left mouse button in one of the window , the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will not appear . ( this will also be visible by the beginning of the group otherwise . ) this group is increased with the color display for current area and to the left a black beam appears .
sometimes , if you have any further line more in the group ; then , in these lines of the text &amp; lt ; No line in the Qu@@ el@@ lies ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps again another source . this text appears not in the final stored file , nor in a mark that you may possibly copy and then .
the text &amp; lt ; merg@@ ing fli@@ ers ; however , if you copy this text from the list window when you start such text from the list window . go carefully with this function .
NOTE : if the sources you select the options numbers ign@@ ore or Ig@@ no@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes to numbers or comments are treated like white signs .
this will navig@@ ate mainly with the image processing and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard exercise left , right , high , r@@ below , side down , side from the beginning , at the end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Ctr@@ l @-@ end , look like it can also be used by other programs . the over@@ sight column next to the vertical bar can also be used for navigation .
in Aug@@ ab@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other keys to work . using the Insert key , you can switch between inser@@ tion and hand@@ writing mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode ) .
one click on the left mouse button in one of the summary columns to synchron@@ izes the view of all windows based on the beginning of the respective group ( as already in paragraph merg@@ es and the edit@@ orial output . )
the tool bar includes seven buttons for navigation using the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous Conf@@ lic@@ t ( Ctr@@ l @-@ down / Ctr@@ l @-@ top ) , to the next / vor@@ ous Conf@@ lic@@ ts ( Ctr@@ l @-@ down / Ctr@@ l @-@ down ) , do not dis@@ solve any conflic@@ ts . therefore , it must be distingu@@ ished between dissolved and UN@@ GE@@ SOL@@ ST@@ EN conflic@@ ts .
to copy the marking into the stop@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g Insert ) , you &apos;ll always copy the option to copy automatically into the intermediate shelf . be careful with this option , but you may obtain the content of the intermediate p@@ board .
line of line are stored according to the round@@ about operating system . UNIX variants use a line @-@ type \ \ r \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 maint@@ ains the line files for source files , you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the list and list of the last used files will be saved automatically and re @-@ made during the next start . ( menu setting up @-@ up &gt; K@@ reducing 3 ... )
choose a let@@ tering with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog appears with variable width , but you should not use them . )
if you activ@@ ate this option , differences are depic@@ ted in ital@@ ic writing . if the chosen Scri@@ p@@ tures are not supported , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be illustrated . in these systems the button provides a un@@ successful color automatically .
if this option is activated , the corresponding number of the tab button introduced the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise a tab character is inserted .
when entering or Return , the return of the previous line is automatically used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be cop@@ ied to the stop@@ board . the manual copy is stored in the meantime .
you can select whether line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly commonly used selection on the used operating system .
when compar@@ ing Files attemp@@ ts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all of identical lines can be ig@@ no@@ red in the source file . only during this first step , white signs will not ig@@ no@@ red . the second step is not ig@@ no@@ red . even at merg@@ ing , white signs will not ig@@ no@@ red .
some ed@@ itors ( on some systems ) store a car back@@ log &apos; \ &apos; at the end of row , but then save files with different sizes in the side @-@ side @-@ side comparison , though they might sound differ@@ ently . if this option is enabled , the car can be treated simultaneously . while the use must be de@@ activated . in the default , this option is de@@ activated .
in the default setting , this option de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding character ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ig@@ no@@ red . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . Ch@@ anges in comments are treated as a white character .
intense even smaller sub@@ divisions . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective with comp@@ lic@@ ated and large files , but slowly at very big files .
in the Auto @-@ continuing mode , this setting , as long as the result of the selection is shown , before the next UN@@ GE@@ DAN@@ CE conflict is passed .
sol@@ ves automatic all conflict in white characters by the chosen file . if you need this time to time . ( default is manual selection . ) It is useful if white sign in many files are needed , then use the automatic selection also conflic@@ ts in numbers or comments if the options are ig@@ no@@ red or Ig@@ no@@ iere C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options will be treated in the chapter to sc@@ ans of folders and break@@ through a merg@@ ing . look for details under documentation to the directory @-@ compar@@ ing and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file . if you have a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original , this will be deleted without additional backup .
the language of the user interface . change this option is not the current running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; make sure the change is active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; because the language is set there via the control centre . )
the following co@@ effic@@ acy settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activ@@ ate this option , it will be used for all entries the upper setting .
on the selection design for the coding , a short notice that the local coding is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has been pu@@ rely on your inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this influ@@ ences how special characters is treated and be interpre@@ ted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , can be compared to different enc@@ oding .
if you arranged a file , you can specify the coding for stor@@ ing to store .
if you specify pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your codec . ( for example , your files can not work 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but the processing command can only be converted to 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
switch it off to press review of changes in white signs to the text or review . ( NOTE : this is also valid for changes or comments if the options are ig@@ no@@ red or Ig@@ no@@ iere C / C + + provisions . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are visible . but sometimes you might only need the differences between two of three files . in normal mode , gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C becomes a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes one would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . keep just the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
the reference window is classified by each other or over@@ lap . this may also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes , you consider the differences and decide to execute files . if you use only two files , if you use only two files . if you use only two files . ( if this function is used to start merg@@ ing file , then the name of the last used output file will be kept . )
at reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the issue of command is visible , and not the file . you can also use your own prevention , which allows for out to cut out parts or to correc@@ ted the return .
at the reading of a file , it will be given first to this external order . if also a normal prec@@ au@@ tion command is given ( see above ) , the issue of command is only used only when the command is equal to your own request . every input line has to have an associated output line .
the thought @-@ behind is to enable the user to allow users more flexibility when using the di@@ ff results . however , most users don &apos;t want to program their own self . good news is , however , that in most cases , the good news or per@@ l is fully sufficient .
use this process cut @-@ out command for line response in large letters to form : SED &apos; s / \ \ ( \ \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This text is in relation to each character . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in the first compl@@ aints . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ control systems use some key words to insert automatically ( info : / c@@ vs / Key _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ $ \ \ _ \ \ $ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ $ \ \ _ \ \ $ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ $ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ $ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \
while you do with my experim@@ ent , you might want to understand , and perhaps you like this regular ex@@ pres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ign@@ ore of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another process cut @-@ out command for line equal . it &apos;s / &#91; 012@@ 345@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a number , and each number is replaced by nothing , so qu@@ asi to be deleted .
sometimes you would like to perform several requirements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ olon &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other . example :
instead , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ase / Switch &apos; All ings are needed at per@@ l some details . where \ \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
data after normal pre@@ processors are kept for display and merg@@ ing . other operations known only the data , which sees the line @-@ like algorith@@ m .
NOTE : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processors , the line of the calculation automatically sees the output of the standard Pre@@ processor .
the processor commands are very useful , but as if any function , the text changed or differences , you can not notice certain differences , and the worst case important data .
often have to edit many files in a file . from this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merg@@ ing .
... makes for each object a suggest@@ ion : you can adjust the proposal before start ,
... can cause sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes to perform without them ,
... leads the selected action either with all ( F7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F6 @-@ button ) ,
this is similar to the Compare and merg@@ ing of each files . you need to open only folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three file are merg@@ ed , Ord@@ ner@@ 1 is used as the basis . if no goal was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 as target ord@@ ner .
NOTE that only the folders automatically starts , not the merg@@ ing . to start merg@@ ing , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key . ( further details follow . )
while reading the file inform@@ s a small news window over the current progress . if you checked the scan of the folder , only the files are listed that compared to then .
if the scanning is completed in the file , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a listing window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and any folder of the scan was found here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the folder super@@ structure will normally be folded . you can use a file , by cli@@ cking on the + / - click on the object or transfer the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of all sub@@ direc@@ tories can be open all sign@@ posts with which you can open all folder .
if you click on a file , the file is started and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol appears in the column name refle@@ cts the data type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the dat@@ at@@ y@@ pe is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in detail window to the selected object . in such case , the collapse is not automatically elected in such case , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as in the above picture , the colors are used in the columns A / B / C colours red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered as identical when their entire contents are identical . then the folders is the same colour . in folder , the age is un@@ significant for its color .
the idea of this colour scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours leaves the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes old .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exists , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exists , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exists , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same date type ( e.g. if A is a file and B a file ) : bug : contra@@ dic@@ tory dat@@ at@@ yp@@ es . as long as such def@@ ective objects can &apos;t be started .
... A and B not have the same date type ( e.g. if A is a file and B a file ) : bug : contra@@ dic@@ tory dat@@ at@@ yp@@ es . as long as such def@@ ective objects can &apos;t be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and not an explic@@ it@@ ly target numbers are given and if the option direc@@ tories is active . then choose &quot; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is that they are identical to both folder . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : merg@@ ing and the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B ; directly after the merge file only B ; directly after merg@@ ing &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two file are merg@@ ed and select the option of new file ( un@@ certain ) , then analys@@ ed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggest@@ s the same date , but the date is identical . if the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange code cannot be solved , the file can &apos;t be started automatically .
while the merge is sign@@ posted a file according to the other . you can copy status column , when the merg@@ ing was successful , and according to other reporting , if the merg@@ ing is finished , you should see a final review and see if the status is OK .
if in the align@@ ment dialog , the file compar@@ ative method of complete analysis is selected , the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , not white and white conflic@@ ts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflic@@ ts is only displayed if three folders will be compared or merg@@ ed . )
you can select either the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all comp@@ uting actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the merg@@ ing .
please note : if you have no target ord@@ ner , then in the three @-@ file merg@@ ing mode C is used as a target , when two @-@ file merg@@ es will be used as a goal and used to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as target .
if you have chosen a target file , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target number , also in order to prevent certain entries due to certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ sweet sur@@ prises :
to perform all entries : select direc@@ tives in the directory or press F7 ( the key pl@@ ush ) . to perform only the current entry : select the current element or press F6 .
if through contra@@ dic@@ tory dat@@ at@@ yp@@ es still in@@ valid merg@@ ing actions exist , a message appears on the faul@@ t@@ ful elements . you can choose a valid action for them .
if you execute all entries , a dialog window appears with the options , sim@@ ulate and break .
if you want to see how you want to see what was going to be done without any changes . you will rec@@ ie@@ ve an exhau@@ st@@ ive list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then take certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merg@@ ing a single file ) , then a merg@@ ing window will open ( note the screenshot ) .
if you are ready to start with a file , select another direc@@ tion@@ aries / continue or press F7 . if you don &apos;t have saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , you will continue to continue his work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , you &apos;ll find out a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll be able to try out the cause of problem ( F7 key ) , or k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other way before you continue with the merg@@ ing .
if some entries were individually merg@@ ed , scores &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entries must not be conf@@ id@@ ent again . even if you exam@@ ine the coll@@ age , these entries will be ensu@@ red when you perform the merge promotion , these entries will be merg@@ ed again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ reducing 3 ... ) now has a section called the directory associated with these options :
only files that are displayed on the displayed pattern , are displayed in the element tree . a valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value is * . file must not correspon@@ d to this pattern .
Files and folders that correspon@@ d to this pattern , are not shown in the element tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ olon ; as separ@@ ating signs . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
Files and folders that correspon@@ d to this pattern , are not shown in the element tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ olon ; as separ@@ ating signs . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ig@@ no@@ red files that are also ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . many author@@ ised files are ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this file specified with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
in some file systems files used a Ver@@ t attri@@ bute . in other file systems , a file named as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on .
links to files : if the option is switched off , sym@@ bo@@ lic link is compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in the default setting .
if the option is switched off when the option is switched off . if the option is switched on , the links are checked and recur@@ sively . ( please note that the links would lead to a link to itself and can be short@@ ened to an endless loop , and can be short@@ ened . ) This option is switched off in the default setting .
a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number dissolved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflic@@ ts . ) The full analysis is s@@ lower than a simple analysis , and much s@@ lower if they are applied to files that no text contained in files . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare big file via a slow network , it may possibly be faster , only the change date and the file size . however , this speed is possible to use with cau@@ tion . this option is available in the default setting .
similarly as the change date . there is no real comparison . the files will be as identical if they are equal to the same . this may be useful if cop@@ ying the change date . please contact with cau@@ tion . this option is not used in the default setting .
activ@@ ate the synchron@@ ize mode when two folder are compared and no target file specified . in this mode , the suggest@@ ions are chosen as they are identical to both folder . also , the results of merg@@ ing files are stored in both files . this option is posted in the default setting .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered un@@ certain , because the knowledge is provided that the other file does not have changed . ) This option is switched off in the default setting .
if a file or a file will be replaced or deleted file , then the original version is renamed as an old backup file with the .@@ original expansion already exists , this is not only merg@@ ing a single files , not only the merg@@ ing of single files , not only merg@@ ing gan@@ ese file . this option is switched on .
normally , the file merg@@ es add @-@ up view to the merg@@ ing single files . if you don &apos;t want to move the window manufacturers with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to push the option directory &amp; text windows to change the window between directory &amp; text windows between the two views .
probably do you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . nevertheless , you can run a single file directly to run the file menu . as soon as you get the result , the status is set on le@@ vel@@ ing and the file will not run once again when you start folder .
however , this status is lost , if you have again read the directory : directory menu : new !
K@@ DE supports network transpar@@ ency with help of K@@ IO sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders , which are located on local or remote invo@@ ice .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a file within a compressed archive with a local file .
a UR@@ L has a different syn@@ tax as local files and folders . some things you should see :
a path can be relatively and@@ . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ L@@ s , these are always absolutely .
special characters have to be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , no mark@@ ings &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the UR@@ L file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system , sometimes the used protocol . however , a short list of limit@@ ations follows :
or it can &apos;t be distingu@@ ished if a link is depic@@ ted on a file or a file . then is always a file as a link target . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit auth@@ oriz@@ ation or change date . therefore , apply the auth@@ oriz@@ ation or change date from the original . ( please consider the option inside the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main application is currently known as the differences in K@@ De@@ vel@@ op . K@@ De@@ vel@@ op . K@@ De@@ vel@@ op is first to launch the integrated differences of differences on the differences and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the Con@@ text menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as K@@ Part used . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names taken out a patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the text menu Preview in - K@@ reducing 3@@ Part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work when any original files exists . furthermore it is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since generation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part implemented , it supports only the Compare from two files , a very small tool bar and menu . merg@@ ing or the Compare of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part Mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ is com@@ pare ) already exists . in addition , the name K@@ wid@@ 3 already shows that it can lead to the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using G@@ PL programs already very long and have much lear@@ nt from the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who went this way or go to it .
you have not compiled the program from the sources and the con@@ figure script will not be communic@@ ated to the correct PRE@@ FI@@ X in / usr / local but then K@@ DE can not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . in the REA@@ DM@@ E file , you can find more information on this subject .
if only the number of white sign is different , these lines are as the same as the same : but if not only a non @-@ wh@@ it@@ ish sign is different , the line is not identical . if , lines , next to each other , this name is co@@ g@@ owns and the case .
the editor moves to any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this important information is necessary , if the result is simple as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to design your own file format that could save this information .
the effort was so far too big . you can use a certain version always by the select of a source A / B / C . in order to edit more amounts of text to edit any other editor .
after remov@@ ing text is suddenly lt ; No src left out ; this text can &apos;t be ext@@ ingu@@ ished . what does it mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used many colors to high@@ ligh@@ tly distingu@@ ish . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and trouble reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information , as you can use K@@ NO@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on your homepage .
you can find a list of last changes on htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in File Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; install and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base file of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir is available to the file in your system , where K@@ DE is installed . if you are un@@ certain , you will find further details in the REA@@ DM@@ E file .

only differences are displayed : files all files in all folders are not identical in folder , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to check out the file with the function updates . )
there are only entries that are indicated differ@@ ently . if the target files are not already cop@@ ied to the target files . if the target not already contains these files , are missing in a later program version ( the behaviour is not changed in a later program version ) . this option is un@@ checked in the default setting .
NOTE the buttons to choose the source with the lab@@ elling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons on the end of the selected group ( if they are already available ) . if the lines are already present , they are removed when cli@@ cking on the button .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . understanding differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a min@@ iv@@ or@@ schau of all virtual work space . it is quite convenient to change their size to change their size , to end them or shift . this works both within a working area as well as several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; all virtual work@@ tops can be displayed as well as the current applications . applications can be selected and even on the working area and to other moves .
with the medium @-@ button key , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and other business areas .
the Con@@ text menu depends on which the right mouse button is cli@@ cked , if the text menu is used only the two entries of p@@ ager ... and the end . however , the text and the name of application as well as the Name minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , working area and par@@ don@@ ations . the commands are using the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of working area . appears only if a application was cli@@ cked .
sen@@ ds the application to select virtual working area . it appears only if a application was cli@@ cked .

you can use a screen saver . you can use with &amp; k@@ le ; a portion of the screen . this application is to be used for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a tend@@ ency . this documentation is a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ like .
it is a very powerful application that extends constantly around new functions . it is optim@@ ised for use on most powerful computers .
if you want to start , a window appears as above . the main window is shown above . in the following window appears the enlar@@ ged area of the screen . the image that is displayed in the enlar@@ gement window , is a enlar@@ ged area of the screen and is displayed in the following window .
in the default setting of setting up &amp; k@@ byte ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter as a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can make a selected screen area in the enlar@@ gement window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse button at screen ( eg ; on the left @-@ edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is depic@@ ted in the larger window , select the mouse po@@ inter . please note that it is still not able to recognize the shape of the mouse points . this is always the default ke@@ eper ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse po@@ inter .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fication window and keep the left mouse button , so you can move the content of the magni@@ fication stage . this is also moving to the arrow keys .
if you add the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . please note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains and only the lower right corner is moved .
&amp; k@@ likes ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlar@@ ged picture directly to the printer , to copy in a file to insert into the meantime ( to insert later in other applications ) , turning the image and much more .
starts / stops the update of the ad . the update of the update appears that the desired CPU time is required towards 0 .
choose the clock rate ( Very small , low , medium , medium , very high ) . the higher the updates , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; I like ; used your introduced short command to store files , open@@ ings of a new window , printing , curi@@ ous ( with the button document again un@@ loading in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , en@@ large and smaller , etc ; .
you can also known as &amp; k@@ rat@@ fier ; it is a screenshot of screen . you can use a magni@@ fier to consider the sound pressure in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different kind of benefits : from research or artists to artists or cra@@ fts@@ man .

&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click once the mouse po@@ inter is cr@@ acked on the same place . it &apos;s meant to help people who suff@@ ers the RS@@ I Syndrome ( rep@@ et@@ itive @-@ strain Inj@@ ury Syndrome ) and each mouse click is preparing for pain .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click once the mouse po@@ inter is one while the mouse po@@ inter is able to help people who em@@ ulate the rep@@ et@@ itive strain Inj@@ ury ( RS@@ I ) , and to which each mouse click brings em@@ ulate with the mouse . this requires a bit of exercise .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; cannot be caused by cli@@ cking on the mouse , and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can search for pain using the use of your computer , if you don &apos;t need a doctor if this is not yet happened .
to make it even clear : even if &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps with p@@ ains that can be caused by cli@@ cking with the mouse , used by the mouse , used by the mouse . and as with all ergonom@@ ic help , the result can vary for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and leads a mouse click once , once you break the movement shortly .
is the smart shi@@ fting enabled , power &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; a break , after the end of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse button . in this way you can use the draw at pressed mouse paste . the smart shi@@ fting requires a bit exercise , but you need to re@@ conc@@ ise quickly .
this time has to return to the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; click a mouse click .
if smart shi@@ fting is enabled ( 1 / 10 s ) this time is set , the time is set up , the un@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool . once again , the mouse button is waiting , if there is no lack of mouse , if there is no evidence of mouse .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool : now it is activated by mouse post@@ age . this feature is activated by a break , one click with the right mouse button . a slow conn@@ ex@@ ion is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es@@ .txt , if &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; the first time has started , but it can be changed later .
when the sound is del@@ ayed , you can move &amp; k@@ le ; to move the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go on Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider generally . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer which you have to reduce the response times .
this setting is marked &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window sizes , please refer to rate to figure out how you will start a program automatically .
all settings back on the values back to the opening of the dialog . have you already supp@@ ressed up the button , the settings will be reset at the stand after the last shi@@ fts .
best use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular the smart shi@@ fting should first be switched off . if you have then click on the automatic mouse click here to share the intelligent consider@@ ation .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ le ; with sounds .
first , you should deli@@ ber@@ ately aware , in which places a mouse click without any effect remains : cli@@ cking on neutral constitu@@ ents of windows or on spots in browser window , which does not represent a link , so that you can use the mouse to such places , until you want to use it again .
when your mouse is printed , you should clean your mouse . it is normally quite simple . the tri@@ ck is that you not only clean the mouse h@@ emisph@@ ere , but also the rolls that come with the mouse h@@ emisph@@ ere .
first you need to take out the mouse h@@ emisph@@ ere . as this happens , is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear if you watch the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . the Dre@@ ck and the dir@@ ty , you can easily remove a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
in very rare situations , the operating system break@@ down the version of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; if you are just a shift process . if in this case the intelligent stro@@ kes means that the surgery could not end through the exercise of mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool , use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run yourself a mouse click . thus , the status of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool will be reset , and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; still click mouse to execute C@@ ursor to another place .
work@@ around : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor to place where you don &apos;t want to use it . but if you don &apos;t want to consider the mouse on a neutral range of work , if you don &apos;t want to consider that the mouse button for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bars and the menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart shi@@ fting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the smart shi@@ fting is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you want to move into the cli@@ p@@ board , to move it into the mouse , and want to move up the mouse with pressed mouse button . but there &apos;s probably some problems with the mouse . here are some advice about it :
use the intelligent stro@@ kes , if you &apos;re just start to start at the beginning of the text area a mouse click - and hold the switching to the other end of the text , while keeping the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this makes a sound look like a mouse click . so you know exactly what when the smart shi@@ fting begins . later you can use the intelligent stro@@ kes without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; it must be installed the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be the case for most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is available only when the system has a sound card and speakers and these correctly set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; pra@@ ises the mouse button once the mouse po@@ inter shortly interrup@@ ted . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I Syndrome and is preparing the concrete of a laying .
and k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; also , it may be config@@ ured that it is a certain time that a draw weight begins before the mouse button is left out . in this way , the draw will also be carried out with the mouse .

probably you have not correct or not complete the command for the language edition . open your settings ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the voice edition . ( see setup dialog for Voice synth@@ esizer to further details . )
Festival is a speech output system of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ ing are supported . licence may include free , Festival free and restri@@ ctions on restri@@ ctions .
to show an example of command line for the setting of language edition , it is thought that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to the speech output is then :
Free@@ TTS is a language &amp; Java ; it is currently only supporting English language . currently , it supports only the English language . license allows to use Free@@ TTS for free and spread without restri@@ ctions .
to show an example of the command line for the device of language edition , it is believed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ aks . the voice edition is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option has to be set on standard data . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ ets into a wav@@ ed@@ file , so you need an additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ ems . licence to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / h@@ adi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is pleased to be added the last sign of the text , so an additional sign must be inserted . the full command is therefore more than in the other examples :
( cat . ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la -@@ e / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; rm / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; rm / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data will be set to be enabled .

as the setting of the language mode only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD only , you must use only possible kt@@ ach@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; mouth ; successful you need a voice generator ( and naturally &amp; cold ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and his configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application that cannot speak with people who cannot speak , text by the calcul@@ ator . a list is already saved , which the users can re@@ print again .

click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system to apply .
choose a tuning type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ ior and female voice to choose from .
if you click here , click on the new spokes@@ man for the map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click on edit .
now you can see &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to card card General and check if language edition activ@@ ate from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can read &amp; kt@@ ts ; please click text to create text contracts to create text contracts . see .
if you have set at least a spokes@@ person , you can start the speech output system of &amp; k@@ de ; click here to open this card card . here you can adjust several general options .
check out this approach to activ@@ ate the business cycle ; this start will start the K@@ DE TTS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text contracts , and you can read text contracts and read the TTS system by &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is finished , running &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue to activ@@ ate the field speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
this anchor field marks and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr will be released automatically in the system area of the control strip , dis@@ appears as soon as the reading is finished .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , break up , keep left again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; pla@@ iting board to read or a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a contract .
click to apply or OK , all changed settings on all sides .
the board map shows only displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map sheet in general and cross the language edition ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check out the text , which shall be read , and select the text menu . after a short time the language edition should start .
it is almost always mean@@ ing@@ ful to mark the text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; template and other in@@ visible stamps too .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read them text . check first if business is read , and select the text to read the text , and select the menu menu . then the voice edition should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quant@@ um ; .
K@@ Not@@ ify is the news of news from &amp; k@@ de ; that you may notify you of not@@ if@@ ies events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; con@@ vers@@ ational ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can establish different types of messages . you can establish a message if in an IR@@ C @-@ channel a message is di@@ visible when you come from with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program K@@ Not@@ ify , a menu entry in the menu settings for this program . here , the settings for co@@ effici@@ encies can be distingu@@ ished according to application .
filter to char@@ ms offer a good opportunity to correct and correct ; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . it remov@@ es the tags / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced cap@@ abilities of business &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter does not require .
in fil@@ tering , before he will be sent to the program the preparation of the language dis@@ pat@@ cher . you are useful for impro@@ ving the language , to select false words or ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations , to select a matching language and speaker to ren@@ ew certain terms of voice synth@@ es@@ ies and their voices .
in order to understand the work of fil@@ tering , it &apos;s important to know how the program is &quot; Current dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the issue of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ern has the highest priority . it will be presented to all other orders . if the output of the screen reader is provided , the orders received continued again .
warning have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor will be getting hot . a warning has prec@@ eded and holds the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning .
News have the closest priority . a message is sub@@ jected to normal text . &amp; th@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you to the room . &amp; k@@ d ; -@@ Not@@ if@@ ications are also News . Read all this .
the rest are simple text contracts . each order to create a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example for a applications that are made text papers . text papers are intended for the issue longer texts that have no particular look .
all four order types are processed in qu@@ eu@@ es , except for the issue of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ern . when appl@@ ying the issue of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ read , this edition will stop and termin@@ ated this issue .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ors . you will be applied to normal warning , news and text papers as well as &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filters the text and give it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filter are designed as modules . in the future it can still use further types of filters .
character sets replace parts of a text by other text . that can be set up either as words or as regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; with pre @-@ defined animation of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SLT @-@ files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with inter@@ ference @-@ selection fil@@ tering , you can send ess@@ ays depending on the text by text , or depending on the text of the text , sent to a speaker . if you can read the text by K@@ DE news about how you can read the text by K@@ DE news .
each of these different filter is adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for a voice edition . if the filter does not re@@ alize that his rules are unchanged , gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Not@@ if@@ ications to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be arranged through all active filter , which is set up on the side below . editing filter takes place in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of fully equipped normal filter . is a filter not crossed , it is not enabled , and it is not used . filter will be turned down from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ let , and it will be displayed below the following entry di@@ alog@@ ues .
for the device of animation , you must enter a list of words or regular expression as the same type . this pattern is found in the text , then the text is ex@@ changed against the respective replacement text .
specify for your filter a name . this name , you can choose to choose to distingu@@ ish only by the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string chains in the column agreement and replaced it in accordance with the string set out of column design . the list is used in the shown sequence of the above @-@ down .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expression from a file to store the current list or delete a list of file , the entries from the file to the existing list .
if a language is registered , the filter only applied for the text order one of the registered languages . click on the button to choose a list of languages , if you can see several languages if you press the mouse click the &amp; Ctr@@ l ; button hold .
if a value is registered , the filter will only be applied when the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ ata . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of programs you will receive the program q@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must be taken away . if for example &amp; q@@ ty ; the application ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you can only copy cop@@ ete .
the string set is only applied to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter applies if all input will be empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words , the character filters will be used in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must be limited to both signs ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no guide to the writing of regular expression . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can find it into the di@@ alog@@ ues or edit the help of these ex@@ pres@@ sions . &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ ducer transl@@ ate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SLT @-@ files from one format in another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such de@@ form@@ ations . but it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c have to be installed on your system .
specify the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PA@@ TH , is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the inter@@ ference filter , you can send text to a particular speaker , which is set on a speaker with certain properties . you can specify that texts by k@@ mail from a female voice should be read . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is selected for the text . the spokes@@ person is selected to the text . the speaker is selected from the spokes@@ person for the text and sent out the text of the speaker @-@ speaking speaker . with the inter@@ ference @-@ selection filter , you can transl@@ ate the chosen speaker .
if a value is registered , the filters will be applied , if the text is used in the specified regular expression . it is installed on your system der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call this with one click on the button to get assistance in the input .
to achieve a faster work@@ man@@ ship , you should try the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression of &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the characteristics of your chosen Spre@@ ader . when the text appeared the above @-@ based filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the required requirements on the right button . click on the button to display the dialogue selection .
use these buttons to store your inter@@ ference Settings or delete the settings .
the inter@@ ference filter will only be applied to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter applies if you need to enter at least a condition .
the speech output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programm@@ ers can give their applications TTS @-@ abilities . applications communic@@ ate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .

None of the mentioned synth@@ esizer supported my language . where can I get a synth@@ esizer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ circulation filter set up , but when using the module &apos;s module will not be read .
due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , thus do not want to use S@@ able web pages if you do not want to use this voice to read websites . make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or inter@@ actions appear to cause a synth@@ esizer , so that all the sent@@ ences can be translated or just Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ d . what can I do ?
make sure that the option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be fixed by a string set filters . see .

the list of above @-@ mentioned languages can be un@@ fully or dep@@ rec@@ ated . consider the description of synth@@ esizer to the supported languages . look for information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; Current dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for synth@@ esizer . if you want to expand and expand the use of a other synthetic material , set up with the development team in connection .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to comp@@ ile a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the study files for the &quot; Best Day . &quot;
if you apply the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility , or each night currently created t@@ ack@@ ball , re@@ placing and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if the @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher uses your language synth@@ esizer correctly . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ sk@@ ri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ le ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that the program can be used as well @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is so well @-@ developed , that the device of @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script will not be needed anymore .
a long text is de@@ composed into single sent@@ ences . the user can return - or leave to leave , repeat the issue or canc@@ el .
if an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can specify the properties of the preferred spokes@@ person for the issue . if you want a speaker , it is used that the best matching speaker is chosen . if you want to see more about it , as &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker cho@@ oses you will see you .
if you click on the card box , click here to add a speaker into the list or on board , the card chart is displayed . as an example , in following the setup of the Modul@@ s for Festival Interactive . details regarding the modules you will find .
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path is contained in PA@@ TH , you &apos;ll need to enter the festival .
select the sign for text , which is handed over to the festival . by voices , business &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be done automatically . generally , that you use Western languages ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak . ISO 8859 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ der scales , you will select sound level , microphone speed and pitch of synthetic language . if you are not select some Reg@@ ulator and these grey will not be displayed by you chosen voice these settings .
some voices such as multi Sy@@ n voices will need to be loaded due to their size . if you are loaded up to this approach , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( in higher memory consumption ) of the first set faster are synth@@ es@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you still have not created a speaker ( or for@@ got to click ) . see .
this anchor field is marked with the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr the program window k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , it is visible in the start of the symbol , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program windows .
if this anchor field marks and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr does not work , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . so , you have the opportunity to keep up or more .
here are all orders in the qu@@ eu@@ es listed , along with the application that has set the order , the number of sent@@ ences , the number of sent@@ ences and the just worked sentence . the Speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card box .
using the buttons in this series you can select sat@@ tion@@ ing in the list , which is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also taken on the other card cards ) and can be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program windows .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ code , click on the card audio . see also .
here are only text contracts and man@@ ages . issues of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ern , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts . find out here .
choose the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled and kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , can not upload the necessary libr@@ aries .
if you are using or a@@ code for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output module will be displayed in the list , you must choose at least one module . if you have chosen AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
put the microphone speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % of the double normal microphone speed . thus , this settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so x .
click to apply to check the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system control system .
the AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device is at you . in doubt select the standard .
on this card card , you can print special promot@@ ions if the text order is interrup@@ ted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders :
the issue of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ern has the highest priority . it will be presented to all other orders . after the issue of Screen @-@ reader , the orders received back up again .
war@@ nings have the next greater priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor will be getting hot . a warning holds the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message is subject to normal text . &amp; -@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read the messages . if you are &amp; eg ; just give a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you to the room .
if a text order is interrup@@ ted by a message , warning or the issue of a Screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the waiting time .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrup@@ ted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played in front of the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card board only applies to normal text contracts . for news , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ern there are no special promot@@ ions if this is interrup@@ ted by a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; k@@ ill@@ ify messages , start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click on al@@ erts . card information is published .
marking the check box to read the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; display information . this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and dict@@ ations ; reads no not@@ if@@ ications before .
if this setting is marked , not@@ if@@ ications where a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears to add the application and the event that you want to add to list .
this event reads the message to send &amp; con@@ vers@@ ational ; if anyone has mentioned in an IR@@ C message with your nickname .
all events that are not specified in the list , are ig@@ no@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this evaluation box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event hit , you have the following options :
if you have selected text in custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following item :
you can enter the properties of the desired Spre@@ ader . standard cho@@ oses the speaker as shown in the list on board map as a top entry . see you also .
NOTE that there are three levels for events . for a certain event of a specific application , this is executed . otherwise the action will be done for all other events of particular application . as last possibility the action comes to Tr@@ agen , which was specified by default ( all other events ) .
the event all not@@ if@@ ications for the application standard ( all other events can &apos;t be deleted from the list . for example , you can specify the present notification as follows :
use the button Save the button to store the settings for not@@ if@@ ications into a file . if you want to start stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list , click on soldering . all entries apart from all directions are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Synth@@ esis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark a text for the control of voices , the microphone speed , the loud@@ ness , gender equality , and the pitch . also marks for the control of the evaluation of ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . following restri@@ ctions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this is the default , the festival is used at the SS@@ ML issue .
if the settings for speed or pick @-@ up in the festival configuration line is not set to 100@@ º ; SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#93; = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enc@@ oding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filter and punc@@ turing filter ( S@@ DB @-@ Filter ) . SB@@ Ds might be synth@@ es@@ ized , since only the first set of text . thus , you can also go or stopped and break down , even if the voice synth@@ esizer this is not directly supported .
here you see the pro@@ position of limit@@ ations . in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be set automatically as a set of limit@@ ations filter . you can change the settings or other punc@@ turing filter , but it will be un@@ sealed .
at the eas@@ iest way you can try out the number of speaking selection , which spokes@@ man and kt@@ ts . switch the speaker selection , change some features and try out how to have a speaker , you will need more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the board can start , since only the first movement can be processed , and not the whole word block which can take very long .
if you want to keep text orders on map orders or break , even if the voice synth@@ esizer did not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal prec@@ re@@ alization filter will automatically be set automatically when you can start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr . it cannot be removed only . change not in this filter , unless you know what you do .
punc@@ tu@@ ation filter compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ position and insert a tobacco mark ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the propos@@ itional sign ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are removed from the text removed from the text ) . notice that the default set of limit@@ ations will be maint@@ ains the char@@ set filters .
S@@ b@@ d filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( kn@@ ot@@ ify ) , warning , news or the issue of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ern .
if you have removed from the normal conditions of limit@@ ations , you can easily add this again by using the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
you can select the map settings for the application . the card board is displayed if
use of the standard drivers ( the top on map speaker ) . in other words , no inter@@ ference properties are specified .
use of the most associated Spre@@ ader , which shows all properties of a furnished speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker , cho@@ oses the speaker . if you elec@@ ts &amp; kt@@ ts , the spokes@@ man , which was originally introduced to the originally set to the originally set .
select the method for entering the desired guide properties by cli@@ cking on one of the selection buttons .
choose the Properties Tab . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box if the property came before other features . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
since the language has a critical factor for the issue of issue , this feature is rarely used as priority language . the only case , if you want to specify the attri@@ bute language if you know that a specific application was sent in any other language as defined in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the field of speaker , use the next to the following , click on the selection button standard for use and then used speakers , which corresponds to the following below .
in this case , 0 for the last text order in the qu@@ eu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 is required ) .
k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr over@@ threw down immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug @-@ Support , but I don &apos;t get back@@ wards .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it &apos;s probably not to record G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , probably is a not compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can update G@@ Stre@@ amer or to install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA will not work when I play simultaneously with another application of music . when I create a text order , fri@@ es &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : un@@ able to open PCM .
on your system , the problem is that conflic@@ ts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent a simultaneous size of multiple PCM devices . notes for possible solutions you will find on the web site of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an extra voice of festival from the internet . I have installed them and can not use them in festival , but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr shows this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fest@@ ival@@ int / Vo@@ ices add the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; UR@@ L ; where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card audio , there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program so@@ x installed and via the environment variable PA@@ TH . some Synth@@ es@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ ul@@ s like festival Interactive is offering a setting for speed . depending on the chosen vote , this active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed will be ig@@ no@@ red , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is what the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activ@@ ate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are encour@@ aged , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML converter , and set the microphone speed .
I do not create that web pages have been read with a female voice . I have set a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.95 beta , the day S@@ able Report seems not work to work . this festival does not produce errors , th@@ rows the X@@ SL file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the gender tags . the same is also true for VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a private string set filters and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts . don &apos;t play any other way or return . on the cardboard base , the order is made only of a sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
inter@@ facing characters ( point , quest@@ ionn@@ aire , issue sign , Komm@@ a and Sem@@ ik@@ olon ) may not be fil@@ tering . use a filter for the set of limit@@ ations instead .

before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your voice synth@@ esizer correctly . follow the instructions that you have received the synth@@ esizer .
Festival is one of the best free TTS synth@@ esizer , whose source code is generally good . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages . with many voices you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of Festival . the German votes are subject to transfer .
this voice sets Festival 1.95 beta or higher . the voice is still in an early development stage . extract the software in the festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / rus@@ sian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you have to set for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select an Cyr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding like the KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
it is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; -@@ distri@@ butions are included . look at the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option has to set the coding to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option has to be set to an 8 @-@ bit ch@@ illi@@ c as an example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; Synth@@ esizer takes over . then the festival takes over the lex@@ ed analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
NOTE that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete language output system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generated language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to generate this di@@ ph@@ one@@ . tx@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate native di@@ ph@@ one@@ . tx@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be produced from German texts .
with this method , additional W@@ rap@@ per @-@ code added to the festival , to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices will not be installed in the mb@@ ro@@ la ; file files are not installed in the mb@@ ro@@ la ; file folder , but in the file festival / lib / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; votes . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then Download the MS German Festival from
directions can be found in the REA@@ DM@@ E file in package that you have downloaded . ( for the use with Festival 2.0 is not necessary to re@@ placing the error correc@@ tions ) . then add the following lines into the file / lib / sit@@ e.@@ s@@ cm .

the command module allows you to use the use of business models ; any language synth@@ esizer , which can be controlled in one &amp; console ; on the command line can be controlled .
in the best you use a command that writes the speech output in a temporary audio file ( wav ) , rather than to send the issue directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; , one module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which enables the management of the network interfaces , the routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user management of a number of system and des@@ k@@ top@@ settings on a single , integrated surface . &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , can be called by sel@@ ecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable the management of TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; creating a simple surface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( kn@@ ow@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by sel@@ ecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it &apos;s important to understand that &amp; kn@@ ur@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t install . physical devices and their drivers have already been working and config@@ ured , thus &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf that enables the device at all , and enables the setting of the network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in Inst@@ alling &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . network devices will be added later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded , if the network settings will be selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index will be selected to automatically det@@ ect the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform is not recognized , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform from the list , the distribution of the distribution and the rele@@ aser , can be met permanently . by the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pre@@ set .
changing the network settings are possible only in the system administration mode . before , all options can only be viewed , the changes can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can easily manage the password mode at the right end of the module . it is the input of the password required .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three ri@@ ders :
the sem@@ en network interfaces will be used to manage the system devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the Reiter network interfaces are carried out :
the specified network interfaces can be used by sel@@ ecting the desired device in the list and click on the interface ... will be processed in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click Advanced Settings link to dialogue with further information options .
with the selection of Automatic , TCP / IP settings will be taken from a DH@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server , the TCP / IP information on each system boots , therefore no further rate required . in the evaluation level can either be selected either DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system .
with the selection of manual , without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP can be performed TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address is required . in the field of network , the sub@@ network is fixed .
if this setting is marked , initi@@ alize the system interface in bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
in this dialog , the values are displayed as a characteristics of the device in the device .
it should be ensu@@ red that the IP address would not be used in the network . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . can determine whether the desired address is already used in use . in doubt the network administ@@ rator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off , if needed , if needed , if needed , select from the list and click to activ@@ ate interface ....
network appliances can be activated or switched off , if necessary , activ@@ ate an active network device through sel@@ ecting the list and click to activ@@ ate interface ....
sets the IP address of the invo@@ ice in local sub@@ net , to drive the physical connection to remote control networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with b@@ ills in other sub network .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the g@@ ateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , it dis@@ sol@@ ves your name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.90 .
the calcul@@ ator to the name of the horse resolution is possible to use a simple management of this list . entries can be added , remov@@ es or amended wer@@ et@@ .@@ DNA entries can be up or down in the list with the buttons or down in priority .
adding a DNS server click here ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ esp@@ ace can be added a DNS server . it will display the dialog New Nam@@ da@@ v@@ n .
first you need to enter the DNS server IP address , then click the button to add the button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click on the button . it will be shown in the dialog .
the list of well @-@ known computers describes the host @-@ to @-@ IP address such as TCP / IP Sub@@ system . it is used primarily associated with bo@@ oting , if no DNS Server can be available . in small , closed network works , it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list of nam@@ ing machines contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will still support this in the test . this is still in the test version 4 .
specify the IP address of the known computer . click Add to Add to Add The dialog New S@@ as .
enter the name of the well known computer and click the button . if the known computer has multiple ali@@ ke names , push button Add several times and enter the other ali@@ ases .
select an entry of an known host computer from the list , and select enco@@ res .... The dialogue of the hosts is shown .
there can be one of the following tasks , then with click OK , the list of the static Host@@ s will be updated .
the settings regarding the network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activ@@ ate the changes , needs to be set in a &amp; console ; the following command will be set .
the homepage of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphic surface as can be used as a package or the installation tool for their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development costs are needed with libr@@ aries and others .
this will be recommended only experienced users . however , it &apos;s not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; cris@@ p ; the following commands should aff@@ ord .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about fundamental network technology will be discussed in the second , all of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files .
this section can &apos;t replace an additional knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information about the integration of the PC can be connected to a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) , and 5 has never found great sp@@ reading . from IPv6 , it is expected to pass over IPv6 as well . this description is concentr@@ ating on the spread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that addresses IP address of a network interface . in foreign network , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the network administ@@ rator , that can be used as a valid IP address , or if available , can not be selected any IP address !
when re@@ placing a private small ( home ) network value should be selected the IP address from a specifically designed for this purpose to avoid IP address to the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore it is possible to use any other use .
of course , you can access the Internet for such machines through setting a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
smaller networks are usually used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks to 250 computers .
in addition , the network mask is set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all the calcul@@ ators are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is required for the IP product line .
the network address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address is 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to the so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works as a closed circuit .
in this part , configuration files that are affected by &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so it is not sur@@ prised when in case of active DSL connections , another content is specified .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is ass@@ orted by the scrip@@ ts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another status as expected can be found .

before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; this may happen on three types :
&amp; k@@ dat ; Sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ information of the band . identif@@ ies &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ set on the band will not be asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted .
identif@@ ies &amp; k@@ dat ; the tem@@ plates , sear@@ ches it according to the appropriate index on your disk . cannot be asked if the band index is new to be created .
everything went straight , the symbol changes the band for band , to indicate that the band was bound . in the status strip a corresponding message appears . the volume of the belt can now be searched out through the entry of the band .
prior to design the band , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; exists by a change of symbol for the band that the integration of the band was solved and shows an appropriate message in the status bar . the band can now be rejected without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band@@ arten need to be form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used for saving of data . this process does not need to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; it cannot be form@@ at@@ ted before you use the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; usually a form@@ att@@ ing of the band@@ es ahead , DA@@ T drives not yet to be form@@ at@@ ted .
after input of the band called and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all the data on the band go lost ! after completion of the formation , the band will be automatically bound and is ready for use .
before you drive the backup process , you need to make sure you need to make sure you want to make sure that you can happen on three types :
choose a file or a file in local file tree . only this file is secured or the file .
mark@@ ings a safety profile in the tree . only the files will be backed up in the profile .
mark@@ ings files in local file tree with one sk@@ ins . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
click the right button key to the local file tree and select in the si@@ p menu ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog appears for backup . in this dialogue , you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears in the dialog . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time .
marking a file or a file in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or the file is checked .
marking the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a prison@@ er . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder .
click the right button key in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure was launched , the dialog appears for chec@@ king . in this dialogue you can check out your selection and change the occup@@ ants .
if you have confirmed the settings for chec@@ king the review , the dialog appears to check out . this dialog shows the progress of testing data as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can open the restore , the files must be re @-@ produced , will be selected . this may be made on two types :
choose a file or a file in one of the archives that include the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder is restored .
choose the desired files from one of the archives with a skin . only the so @-@ marked files and / or sub@@ folder .
click the right mouse button on a file or a file in one of the archives and select in the menu .
once the restoration process was launched , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialogue you can check out your selection and change the occup@@ ants .
if you have confirmed the settings for the recovery , the dialog appears again . this dialog shows the progress of the restoration process , as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band@@ in@@ dex@@ file using the band content . this process sol@@ ves all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this is a f@@ uses profile with the straight marked files and default settings . you can use the following settings :
the current occup@@ ational file where the saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ards are to be made . the list of the files will be updated automatically , according to the chosen working files .
for all file , which are listed under secur@@ ing files that are located on the same fil@@ esystem , which are located on the same fil@@ esystem , which can be used on the same file systems , you can apply separately under secur@@ ing files . every entry is collected from tar independent of the other file systems .
conduct a inc@@ ur@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been used since the last inc@@ ur@@ mental file , a sn@@ ap@@ shot file will be backed up since then .
the name of the file that uses the changes of changes in the last inc@@ ur@@ ing@@ ual backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ ap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes that all files will be backed up and a new sn@@ ap@@ shot file for the next backup is used .
the functionality of the buttons are &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented for the time of creating this documentation .
you can make the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can take you :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ winding variant of the belt .
if this setting is active , transferred &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is bound to the drive . in some drives this is necessary , before reading or writing operations .
if this option is switched on , attemp@@ ts to shut down and shut down on tape drives . possibly this setting does not work with all band@@ ages .
if the option is switched on , the connection of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ card@@ ed the band automatically . use this option not using flo@@ ppy stre@@ aming .
if the option is switched , attemp@@ ts &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable log sizes . whether this setting is active or not , you must be &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band drives .
if &amp; k@@ dat , a band form@@ at@@ ted , writing it a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should just give a memory block on the band . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( N byte ) The band ID . the format of this character is invo@@ ice : seconds , whereby the host name is the full name of the system , which was form@@ at@@ ted on the band . seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ at@@ ted since the era .
the band ID is used to be used with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ archives that can operate directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar -@@ versions should work , as long as it is not in@@ valid f@@ uses .

&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ le ; -@@ viewer for system prot@@ oc@@ er@@ olls . the program is available for un@@ experienced users , where you can also need information about your system . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can access the fast access to any problems related to their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer doing in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , which cannot know where you can get information about your system , or where the system can be depos@@ ited for the different protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users the fast access to the example of information about problems which perform on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; thus tries to provide some enhanced functions , supported the protocol files modified programs .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 poss@@ esses &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sys@@ log @-@ Ser@@ vers and Sam@@ ba format
many other features are also included in addition and are discussed in the subsequent chapters of this hand .
as you can see in the following screen photo , shows &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions for the individual protocol of a protocol can be easily fil@@ tering and sort by means of the individual possibilities for sorting and fil@@ tering will be shown in the next chapter of this manuscript .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol takes place , and it opens not instead of a small news window , so you don &apos;t want to have using system for@@ erunner . the protocol files are usually taken in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually have no auth@@ oriz@@ ation to read .
you can also use the filter strip for fil@@ ming after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to the specified character set . in the default setting , the selection box contains only displayed next to the filter , if in one of the columns the string set is contained in the filter search engine .
you can also select another record . the string set of the filter search results will be used in compliance with the setup of a process . if you have a process in the filter strip the names of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines sent to which of this process have been sent .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of stage errors will be displayed with a stri@@ king colour than protocol lines of stage . the colour display of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off .
if you would like to see certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this may be useful for example , if you want to exam@@ ine the issue of a certain command as for example to the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you can use filter strip .
in addition , you can enable the option to activ@@ ate all new lines in the context of the main window , to display all new add @-@ off lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate windows . to open this function , use the entries in the window to open extra window and to manage . once you have selected a window , select the menu to the display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ s@@ oftw@@ are@@ .@@ org@@ . D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the source of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .

welcome to &amp; k@@ le ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following so named ) as &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; . this section does a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v .
the system V In@@ it develops rapid to the standard for controlling the program , at the highly cycle of system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time flexible is as the traditional BSD inputs .
I &apos;m not going on str@@ ati@@ ally aspects ( and others because I don &apos;t know about this : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is therefore important because som@@ eb@@ ody could try out a machine at system V In@@ it , without a new installation and re@@ form@@ at@@ ted . that &apos;s why you need to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed there , if there was there any one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it is also distingu@@ ished by the BSD content that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder from / etc will take place directly in / etc . this file is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following further folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole amount of scrip@@ ts . generally , you need a script for any system service that you want to run on another round level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services would not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls may include r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie down under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there are not much using this file , even if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you want to do anything with the serial connection , what you want to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for various locations after the program in@@ it and starts the first , which he finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see the following line as the following :
at this point you can design a look into the second column and probably reve@@ al that the pre @-@ set run@@ level 3 is . if you wish to edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand , then you can repair all this , then enter it once you start the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the correct scrip@@ ts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you can probably look like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this file . instead , each entry is an link to one of the scrip@@ ts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d list .
how to start and stops in@@ it all system services ? very simple : each of the scrip@@ ts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scrip@@ ts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would reads the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if a K contains , will be called the script by the argument , will be called the script by the argument by the argument .
some people would like to create many purposes such as htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; can also be run . furthermore I could even have a user @-@ lap level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , Network &amp; etc ; .
here you can learn the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; with a mouse or another character unit is simple to say not to say tri@@ vi@@ al : draw an entry from the range of dis@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch him on this level ( or stop ) .
you may also move the scrip@@ ts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n move or position within a level by changing it . so the entry will be removed from its original run@@ level ( or his position ) , this is only going to with@@ draw an entry from the range of dis@@ able system services .
NOTE : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed when you need to copy these into a new range . in order to select only one new run@@ level , you need to select copy from the menu and then in the target range , even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action .
the sort code number of a bit can be not calculated . in such a case you must work the concerns of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
NOTE : there is no possibility to restore entries to the paper bin . be so c@@ auti@@ ously .
you can use the tab -@@ key to activ@@ ate the various work@@ ranges ( dis@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 stop , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the c@@ ursor keys to meet a choice of upper or below previous previous .
to shift one entry into another round level , move it with cut into the meantime ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired round level with Insert ( with Ctr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sort code or the name of a piece manually , press the entry button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog through re@@ boot the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to ref@@ use the changes .
due to the risk of the data loss , all entries in the menu is a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ rc . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ rc ) . changes to the default settings are stored in a local ks@@ ys@@ v@@ rc .
I have tested the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ op experim@@ ented , and now is the machine @-@ resistant to the machine . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read details in the manual page .
the species , such as system services will be launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately not any standard . the authors of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v is planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check whether all configuration files are required ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply end no message if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , even if you use a version of version . if you can use another distribution , please send us information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the text adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have done changes , you have to save it . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry Save in the menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple use . the main window is made of two boxes , user and user rating list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog User or group properties .
some card cards will only be displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you don &apos;t want to use custom settings . if you can choose custom settings . other cards appear if shadow pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as are installed in BSD .
the card panel pass@@ words appear if shadow pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as are installed in BSD .
this card card appears only if you can be activated for at least a set @-@ up file system ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able on the file quot@@ as / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) , and can be changed for each user parameters , whereby the registration positions each are in KB are :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for any file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field system .
the board map provides information on the group members of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , you will find in the field of Prim@@ era Group . furthermore , users can be member in other groups by placing these in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to add that users in the list .
to add a user or add a group , select adding from the menu users or group or click on the appropriate Add @-@ button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting of the selected users or the selected group will work analog@@ ous .
with this module , you can remove the LI@@ LO Boot@@ manager , remove the boot password , remove the time to add the standard operating system , list operating systems , change systems , change and more .
