<seg id="154">The separation of the original and working files, simplify a backup strategy and migration. they will always know if you are looking for a original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the options to activate the metadata in the settings side of the metadata in & digikam. if you forget that exifications and IPTC data can be stored in the file, then you can select the metadata out of the database into the files, select the appropriate point to the respective item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change that? it is a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now start the real work, since you should select any photo words, descriptions and an evaluation. of course you can select all images that need the same attribute and select the value. this makes sense where you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us take a keyword, keywords, like you want to proceed with other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you are cataloged pictures from another source with embedded words, then becomes & digikam; automatically add the images to the right place. the changes of the hierarchy is not a problem and can be easily accessible by using a underway to another. the changed words are from & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata shows. this is a very rough replica, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the words - the next section refers to descriptions or comments, the third important tools to catalogus your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to see most of your photos to see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certain to interest as your photos.</seg>

<seg id="165">For other the photos of view is the title probably more important than the picture yourself to create a story. remember that the key is the meaning of viewer to help him to help Him about the motive that you don't understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect if there are the strength only with a labelling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can save a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), you can also export your testimonies to your wishes to the labelling and / or the title of Web-Galeriesystems. you must tell the story so for the opening times a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the time before GPS? when you had to find another town without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures, the beginning of the spatial presentation is now available with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities for geolocation are already innumerable and become a prosperity. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your travel with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures at the recording location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; using Google Maps Maps.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyrights is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of copyright to remove limitations above the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also applies in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description says that information on the outskirts of & digikam; as information is deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonymous with plate and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photograph. if it was not desired to be changed, the name of the photographer or organization is not to be changed. this field is neither commas nor Semikolons as partitions.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autonomy (synonymous with author): linked with the author. this field contains the working designation of the photographer. examples of the photographer, freelance photographer or independent photographer or independent photographer. as this is a vermerk to the author, this field must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (Synonym for Contributor): use the Anbieterfeld to identify the photo. if the photographer is listed here. if the picture is a warehouse, then the group / agency will offer the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important the author and copyright sections, although this does not have any protection against abuse. each of those who have a bit more than basic metadata, it can only be used in the image embedded metadata. for individuals, this is only for the majority of your photos only of low interest. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam. in the near future, it will provide such a tool for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record errors, plate failure, ECC, transmission error, ageing of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desastervorating, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs out on the road or a fire. this kind of losses might happen to you also at traditional paper photos or negative. in this section you can find problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data mining company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to tackle the problem with CDs / DVDs, you can't want to get more than a few years old. of course you can get more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the pieces of a lifetime of 100 years for itself. if you think it is in your dimeasurable room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can be unreadable, but you can easily reduce this risk in which you are good disks and good recording equipment. the top DVD recording files are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it is so to choose the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very incentiated for errors, even if you're just written only. 75% of data are only effective data, the remainder are needed for the formulation and the checksmen. despite this massive protection, they are using chemical aging, Ultraviolet light, cratzer, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a reasonable program called IsoBuster that works with CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is also not available for Macs. there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disk drives, hard drives, flashmedia, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray disc seem to store the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus has almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all of which CDs and DVDs was also valid for Blu-ray Disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording studio on high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. Read all the media with a description, date & author license and later on a clean, dark dry and before animals sheltered the information on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Dissives keep your statistics for themselves. her manufacturer include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives: discriminers</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks are running on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperature, the frequencies are not established immediately. some of SMART is the most common failures. these are especially readers and an old counter. the expected lifetime of life ranges between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just around the complete loss of losses due to overvoltage. of course you may have backed data loss due to a power if you have backed up the files but these losses can normally be used without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices electricity are not far off. these can take serious damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed keyboards, complete data loss, hardware motherboards, disrupts motherboards and other defects. protect themselves before the unavoidable that led to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against electricity tips is an overload protection. this is a device that is absorbed in the form of energy flashes and the rest is available usually in the form of a plug-in strip. remember that not each coil strip also contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are searching for a overload protection, then you should pay the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that he protects the protection against lightening strikes.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be connected to your computer, you should also make sure all the peripherals and cable modems can also include a telephone connection for your modem. other offers connectivity options for the coaxial cables of the cable modems and the television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overload protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and thus also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection your system is based on smaller variations in the electricity lines. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of unprofitable data. it can therefore be meaningfully to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overvoltage, these tools will be able to save your data. some models allow you to save your data. some models allow you to get the same quality requirements like a overload protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your RECHNERSYSTEM can be exposed and compare its security in currents with the cost to avoid this. a qualitatively high quality overload protection can be used for less than €; 20. this is just a small price difference if you think. at the end you should always remember any cable before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as backup under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a secure target for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store data on data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard disks, however, too expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. furthermore, you need to send the data about comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general safety solution. therefore it is slowly.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo-Community 23hq.com are available online storage services. your professional version provides you more available, in case of Flickr dramatically. for 25 $per year you get unlimited memory, which should be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission error are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocols, and with the big companies included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory. so they are desasterable.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transfer chain in the computer. all transfers are due to transfer errors. the file system needs to be used at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one has occurred when it happened in your hardware. all this disruptions remain incorrect until you should have any protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought that it seems to be remembered. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more safe data way than that is in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source for transmission losses, as they generate interventions within the data flow. at normal file systems remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently unaffected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, thousands of errors will be seen per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who are available with plate missing on lower level. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon available for & Linux; and Windows is available for this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still using the Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that is used and is also available for & Linux; but it's not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">This is not appreciated that these two factors are responsible for 86% of data losses in notebook and 46% at workstation systems. with notebooks already the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most chisels. it is limited to a lower damage, e.g. theft or new installations. Apple users have known only very few viruses and under & Linux; there was no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to set the widespread filesystems. find a very good original article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and loss: false, only the speed of trial process during one operation is higher and a defined status is avoided. if however, a file is not fully stored before the problem happened, she is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the largest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main cause for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras are 1-2 blocks of fundamental physical limits. community is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today cameras go in direction of 10 Megapixels. even if this resolution is already very high for compact cameras. even DSLR Cameras have a limit of 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full size sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk you get today for 100 & euro; so you are not responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are frequent in each year of a database and test this fuse before you're using any hazardous like the reinstallation of your operating system, exchange of plates or the size of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose a day your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, lightning strikes have you happier if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys one amount. forgot an airplane: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough. they usually affect an entire room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desastervorality always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses to the steps into the neighbouring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above as already said is a more common reason for a data loss in spite of securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete securing: a complete securing all files are secured. it is a moments of no history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete system. generates a complete moments of two time points: the complete security and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incurable backup: a backup of files have been changed since the last backup. several moments have to restore any time. this fuse comes back to such a backup system with the exception that it is only abbed and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily setup easily on your machines. in contrast to Skript-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, only the difference of files are really changed. this happens now and if you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another opaque medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach will be enough time to discover losses and restore again. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moments for each month and a moments for each month. any further development should be done manually, after you have a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: data stored IPTC information, associated with XMP files, original keeping, memory, scalability, media, can find pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">With this valuable photos the next 40 year, it is about that time in you are really interested in you, because they remember your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unpredictable with caution, you must consider everything that today is predicted with caution. unfortunately, there is no other possibility as a certain qualities. if less variations you have used in the past, so it's easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question is supposed to be addressed via the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for each. if you have an old system that it is important for reading your images, then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for a later usage.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: anyway, if you change your computer architecture, your memory and fuses technology, or your file format, you should review your library and needs to convert to a newer standard. keep in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialized pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means it always means.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out of which you plan to have up the scalability with plant and partition. they don't want to copy on a dedicated plate or partition. * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and transferred to a new sheet:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check out with the command dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but they don't hang them.</seg>

<seg id="236">Open source standards have the major advantage of an open specification. even if one day is no software anymore, you can read this yourself. this task will be easier for a year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format the slowly from the market. they should no longer use it.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been replaced as an open source standard as an open source standard. it can be lost, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. PNG can also use relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format would like to recommend you to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression salary algorithm (Deflate). this problem is that this format is adapted to many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licence-free and open raw file format, it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use the use of metadata. a handful camera update is already available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon es sometimes any time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe is introduced to replace the XMP technology to replace the 's & quot; Extensible metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF. the file information will be supported with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers go before a original of your photo, mostly in the raw format, as it saves the metadata separately from the image file and the image file and how it is reasonable for the link between the metadatfile and the image file. therefore, you should translate whether you use DNG than containers and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core metadata Initiative is an open organization that support a large area of influences and business models. to the activities of DCMI and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and explanatory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and interns.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures on the cameraman are, you can use this as a temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save this in your shell pository. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine, you can use external programs. if you want to add the images again with & digicam; then you should add the metadata. these were cut off to other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the worked images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the section, you can find pictures you can already add to your hard disk, but you can already add many advanced settings for importing pictures to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; connect this with the machine, switch the camera to the display mode and switch them. another description of you will find in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, this will start with your camera. if the connection is made, a heel indicator will be displayed on the lower end and the examples of all photos on the camera. some cameras do not appear, the filenames and a symbol for any file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera formations to each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of a entry or his metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information to be stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded from your computer. NOTE that in some digital cameras do not see all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notation, GPS etc. of the image. these information is the same as the metadata-side panel from the main window of & digicam; or the image processing. please note that these metadata were not available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer, the click on the button to download and then the selection of all camera in a single album in & digikam;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to download the pictures sure you can delete pictures from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the default selection by default. once you select the photos, use the button Download and then select button. the button chosen is available as long as you select some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is not available. these pictures have not yet been updated to you. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the case. if you choose this option, you will only download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons on or Selected combination, a dialog appears where you can read the target album where you can read the target album as normal file, you can read in the section My albums. then select the target album out of the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and digicam; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can choose to remove them from the camera. if you want only delete a few, then you must select that first and then delete extinction.</seg>
<seg id="260">NOTE that there is no possibility to recover you from the camera you will be deleted from the camera. you should be carefully check if you want to remove them from the camera. if you want to erase it from the camera, you should make it much faster on the camera, as it is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos are often not appreciated. the filename will be deleted. this may also be meaningfully to integrate pictures, the date and time where the image has been done to integrate the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options to shooting and spelling holder. if you use this latter option, automatically stops a file per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options on the transfer opens three more options that are carried out before the photos on the plate will be stored on the record standard. if you select that, the corresponding entries will be copied from Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct a date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another date format as the default format, you can add e.g. in the processing field of prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. turn the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of command stringtime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera file names, you have the opportunity to change the filenames in small letters. or in large letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digicam; for a photo is displayed below the name, which will be stored in the preview of the camera. their settings are stored for renaming and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time record. not all cameras put this information. in the section of page metadata you can read more details about the information that set your camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally enabled, and when your camera doesn't want this information, lets you want to switch off the automatic rotation, use the button extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera is made available on the date, you can read & digicam; this subalbums are based on the picture sequence. all images will be downloaded on the same date. not all cameras provide this information on the same date. in the section side panel Meta data you can read, which would have embedded information your camera into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in that case you want to change this option directly in the finish album. if you want to change this option, you need to select this option on the lower end of the window at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way photos from its calculator to your camera is the button Download. then select upload. select the file choice dialog & kde; if you can select the files that you can be uploaded, you can also choose to select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>

<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, it is a position that can be displayed in length and latitude. the determination of data can be performed from the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, to the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photography, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place. not everyone uses a plane to cardiovate GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural bureros and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was made, you can send a postcard to another & digikam; user you want to locate the location of the photos, or just write this aspect document, it's good the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how are the GPS data in the image? first, you should know that the data comes into this fields? there are at least three ways to reach these fields. directly with the correct hardware, via a successor of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical correspondence (manual), and last about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is no camera which has a GPS unit integrated. but there are some that work with GPS receiver. either as map module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3</seg>
<seg id="279">The download of GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. you must save these data in gpx format, since this is the only format to be supported by the module to Geographic Procedure.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data from pictures and from GPS extracting and correlated. on the following page you can see the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>

<seg id="297">With the setup of PNG files, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this surgery is not reduced the image quality, as PNG have a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. it means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF files, you can convert the Deflate -compression algorithm for TIFF images. this is reduced the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on the image quality, since the deflates -Algorithm has worked out free.</seg>

<seg id="301">The standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal in sensitive on ultraviolet light when the pixels are using this problem with minimal loss of details. this option draws this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option draws the picture a bit soft, but eliminated the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VN3G or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is it a fixed colour balance sheet, which was photographed on a white card which was photographed on a white map.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, so the parts of your camera will be burned due to the inability of your camera to consider as through the inability of your camera. the setting is produced some unusual results, because they are trying to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible, since blue pixels are not so fast as fast as green and red. & digicam; and dcraw are the missing green and red-shares of the still not saturated blue pixel. of course this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option to reconstruct your option, you get the possibility to set a level. this is a value of three compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminescence to your taste. you must probably be somewhat higher than the default 1. this may also be done later in the image options of the & digicam; image processing. in order to get the time for the demo server, you should be careful!</seg>

<seg id="317">The input profiles should be customized. not all profiles are made on the same type. there are some, such as Canon, which contain any colour tonmapping or Gammacorrect correction. this means that you have to conduct the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate it. this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated, rather than to rely on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious that colour profile for them is intended. unfortunately, it is not compatible with the models of Canon. therefore, here you can fit a table of cameras and profiles. this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion can recognise the style: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Port and S for the standard style.</seg>

<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, enlargement factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the upper edge and beneath the tool bar to fast access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of image processing changes your photos. however, the features will change the original photo, before you can use the Save or the button Save out of the tool bar. NOTE that you can't restore the original photo, once you have the image saved.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should be evtl. copy a copy of your picture before you change it. it can carry out a file with the store.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not stored the photo, you can use the original image, using the menu file, reproduce image processing in the toolbar. you lose any change that you have conducted at the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any promotion of image processing cannot be done or restored. the last action can be reset, relocally regrets or reproduced by using editing.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this often, you should make the keyboard shortest, Ctrl; -z to reset and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB, on the replacard or restore button in the tool bar a moment longer, you will receive a Context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are made between also back and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you move the image processing, you can move between the photos of the same album or the same keyword, you can use the navigation use in the toolbar, picture high, picture below or entries in the menu file. if you have any changes on the current photo, you are asked whether you want to back up this page.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can see in the photo, and zooming in the Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the use menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">In order to adjust the window size, you can use this knob in the toolbar: magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Saver displays the picture in full screen mode. if you don't want to use the toolbar code. if you don't want to see this in the settings dialog by & digikam; change it from the & digicam; main window will see the section to set the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the menu file, you can print the default and kle; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual pictures or entire movements. all picture pages can select from your selection. you must select only the images with the default methods and select printing assistant. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice only.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicam; main window has a page bar at right edge, the important information and actions for the selected pictures are available, without the navigation file, also available in the image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same rider can be appearing back into the edge or disappear in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view you can enter signings with unlimited size. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labelling will be copied into the EXIF- and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data files are only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are removed after 2000 characters and are formed by other characters. if you want to use the IPTC lettering field in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After having commented it, you can use either the button or switch to the next image, the labelling will then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button there is a button. with this, you can read more metadata out of the selected file or the database. but this is always done if you have chosen a metadata adjustment which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation review shows an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. the evaluation from the page mode is always applied to the same image. to rate multiple pictures at the same time, select these from and use the Context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field urgency. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword depicts a search box for the filtering of the words, the sample tree and a selection box with previously appeared in this & digicam; -session endowed jacks.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keytree loom will be adjusted in accordance with the given search phrase. you can quickly use the number of possibilities in search for a keyword quickly, this ability is especially useful if you have many words.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief during the input of jlitters in a picture series. if you have different words, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords may also be set through markings of the appropriate check boxes in tree. all keywords are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple pictures are selected in the main view and you can select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the entire selection, if you want to read a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side panel jigtfilter is used to change the selection of the main window frames with their album, - Datum-, keyword and Searchies. if additionally, one or multiple sample filters out of the right side will only be displayed. all produced words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You may also accept connections and place. suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply ask it out of the right side panel and put on a dialog if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter is chosen to no sample words. they were taken with Strg + a, and afterwards it was taken a keyword from the right hand tree to the selection, and that this keyword should be given.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes takes place at any start of the program. you can also be switched on different versions.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and establish it, it can be one or his own, you can easily change this easily with a double-click on the text and control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, after which is wanted in the database. this is an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the Operator, which is a name or a string, which is already written in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can find a extended search about all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to match choices, you need only check the check box at the end of the rule and then follow the button. the options then look like this:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why to create a colorful workflow, you can reach the colors from your camera or scanners, you can achieve that colours on your monitor or scanners, you can print the colors on your monitor or to print the colors on your monitor or on the web of your digital nightchamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic is based on color administration, then you want to press what buttons needs to provide for the results of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide sufficient background information about colour management. in addition, links with a deeper information allow you to make your own information decisions to make your desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow performed all six below, then you need to take care of colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other aspect ratio is by e-mail or web, where sRGB of the de-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is doing so well, and life for all so easy, why you should use another colour space so that thoughts about paint administered ng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB compared to the colors which we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional reporter of all colors which we can see, the hufeisenical region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, please visit Bruce Lindblooms excellently and click on information and then on information About RGB Working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to fix my monitor, if I decided to work on my RGB color space only?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB color space or not, you need to monitor your monitor. if you're using your monitor, so you need to use your monitor to the sRGB standard, you must use either your monitor to the sRGB standard, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections which can improve the picture in most cases. use it before you try to try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions can normalize the same, automatic and contrast from the menu correcting automatic correction automatically out of your colors. they will need to experiment with these effects, to see what the best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalizes: this method scalable the light output values above the whole image so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is so bright as possible without any colour shaded. this function is often an gastronomic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method: this method is adjusted the lightention factor in the colors of selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channels are even so flat as possible. this means a very good results in the improvement of the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either miracle with a picture or it destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. the dark and bright border shades and adjusted the red, green and blue channels in the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improved the contrast and the luminosity of RGB values of a picture by the postpest and highest levels of all values. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicam; is a semi-automated tool to complete the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted to an colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can occur too far from the original image, if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which can operate in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of urrectly legally protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start on the menu entry colors white balance of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window can be adapted to the size. on the left side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target box. if you want to see the original white balance, then click on the lower window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target company has a red markers. the luminance of the pianist with this markers is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is a histogram, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small Luminescence. with one button you decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be called.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result was hanged by shadow, saturation and Gamma. the shadow of justice will improve your favorite details or down also down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Attach to the above controls, you should use the colour temperature pipette. push on this button and then somewhere on the image preview for calculating the colour temperature to the white balance. this type will also be automatically set to the temperature and green values.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white balance with the list of the default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The coatlocoator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the Pio- transformers.. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure Indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and store do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you can store it into a text file and later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knob presets all filter values back to their default values and corresponding neutral white balance. NOTE that even neutral settings will see another picture as your original. if you save this store your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding control per colour channel of the processed image format. 8-bit coding is better suited to high quality images. however, this coding requires even more disk space, computing time and stands for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of tubes. it uses the change and assignment of color profile. colour tonmapping can be performed by the window for the brightness. a detailed instructions for use of paint profiles, you can move the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colors pickup. this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same correction. in the manual for audio-correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find in the menu on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digicam; Tool Farbeffections provides you four colour effects, a solar energy effect, an Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and a Canoe filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect of the image has been developed, and then the development of the image has been inverted. the result was a partially negative inside of image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">Intensity controls the solar control. at about 50% intensity shows the image which is electroless possible. an additional increase creates a negative image that is not usable on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and the standardization (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -Effect. he differs from a saturation effect, it is brilliant, brilliant. try it easy to make a lot of photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name to be created by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquire; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvias strongly have a choice for natural photographs. Velvias strongly which are also some Photographers, especially to whom the scarcely sceneries are too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrast of the contrast. the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the strength of the neo-light. at large pictures, the filter can add the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it's not unusual that you want to experiment the colour taping and the lamp in the menu below colours. all your justice will be satisfied with the result. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a photo in bad light conditions, you can get a good choice for brightness / saturation of saturation. all changes you can perform in the preview. if it's the result you can confirm the changes with ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leukstrength / Contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction for improving the exposure. even if the dialog appears to this tool very complicated, you will need for the range of shooting purposes only the range of slider. concrete the three shooting below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window includes an application of the intensity values, a histogram, of active canals or the selected area. under the graphic, three shooting in the picture are exposed to change the intensity values. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move to the control, and change it to the image as the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and the preview of the picture will be viewed. the preview is dynamic, updated from the picture of the picture. on the left hand, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this evaluation box can be displayed if the histogram with a linear or logarithmix Y-axis is often used. for pictures of a constant color, the linear histogram of a single column is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic initiation is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top of the dark sounds, the middle of the bright sounds, the middle of the shades, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colors peted can be used in the preview of the original image, to adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright sounds. moreover, there is a knob for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values can be used to change the selection values for each area. there are also two controllers can be used to change the output values such as the input values can be used as a background for something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically expandable depending on the intensity values.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with this buttons, set the set values in the file system and reloaded later again. in addition to this, the Gimp levels is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using these mode and the three color pipet, the input values automatically adjusted for all shade, medium and solarium will be re-adjusted, and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram, green, blue and the luminescens.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option transfer indexed indicators will display all colour channels to display overloaded pixels, and this combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect on the preview only and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below, you can see an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha canal, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and this corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the originals and the target image is indicated. the preview can be viewed in dependence by your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: these evaluation box allows the channel to specify the channel from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two icons are to switch between a linear and a logarithmix view. most of the linear mode of a constant color, the linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curator after right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds can be correspondent and correspond to the associated image pixel darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marked on the curve. if you want to change this mark on the curve, you will create a right line on this line and move the value on this line and move the value to your taste, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with this buttons, you can do exactly this. every turn you can replace with this file system and later, the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you set this method and the three color pipet buttons, the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and solarium. activate the color, you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option transfer Indicator will display all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than a channel overloaded pixels, you will receive the combined result. this is a preview only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white picture which has been corrected in the luminary. Shadows and solarium was set with the collions and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digicam; image processing is a tool to enhance the color channels or to change the shaded photos of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can process it from the menu-channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can see the relative distribution and calculation. the left area of the window shows you a preview of the window. the original can be viewed to compare over the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target range has a red markers. if you set this in the image, a vertical line in the histogram to display the respective user value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction allows you to activate this channels when you enable the corresponding paint component. this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the option of great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you choose Monochrome, reducing the reduction of a color to a visible space that comes from the same place in color channel and whose space is different from any channel. if the case is, you can improve your Monochrome converting to improve the farming.</seg>
<seg id="447">The store as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any popular mixer setting can store you for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option transfer indexed indicators will display all colour channels to display overloaded pixels, and this combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect on the preview only and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted. this option is activated. the original image is activated (1) and this image has been shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your Abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step, as color pictures can easily be converted to the machine. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film transfer with a green left filter. this looks good for portraits against the sky. thus, like the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranverter: simulates a black / white film photography with an orange lens filters. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Oranfilmed.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film transfer with a red lens filters. this creates dramatic vision-effects and can simulate Mondlicea to daylight. thus similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film transfer with a yellow lens filters. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: this creates hot bright and medium tones while he adds a bit cold in the saddles of a pressure and recovery in a septic acid. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepia.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using & digicam; tool texture, you can contact decorative textures on an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">Through the adding a texture to your picture, irrespective whether it is a colour image or not, you can look like a oil painting on a wallpaper, a pop style portrait of enlarging points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used for the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: floating this parameter to the right increases the level of depth and three dimensional texture of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper Textured is applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and changed to (2). the parameters of relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Adding a decorative frame can be added with the & digicam; tool bar can be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is no easy task. to keep his attention to keep the image of a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the streaming eye. adding the module from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired type of box for your picture. through an dilute line and wide range (ideal for black-white images), the ideal frame is ideal for a button extension and decoratively added a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range is limited by 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">That with the frame-decorated target image is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially when you have used the tool to add the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily add a-format text into a picture of any spot. this is also on several locations if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply use the text and place it with the mouse. use text, orientation, color from the colour space and the character set of the picture size. for the end, you can simply choose a frame around the text and / or a half transparent background. the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting, which you have chosen for your text can be changed, until you have entered the button "OK. after the image once was saved, the text is part of the image. he cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; tool stencil, you can place a stencil about an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image stencil to be used in the image processing, to place an image on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil, there is no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should you want to add a e-mail in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-Users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time you need to put your stencil file with the button base files in the dialog. select the file into the stencil files. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root ordner set out for the templates which reflects the Ordnerstation of the stencil manager. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarged the following picture. it is centred around the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Crises: this knob resized down below. it will be centered to the position of the mouse. if you want to use the mouse on the whole image, you have to verify the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Shift: use this button to move below the template below. take the picture and put it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to address the stencil to your image. the picture is then adapted to the template size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; presents three different tools to sharpens. each of you have preferences in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpens is a traditional tool for sharpening. it's very fast and simple, but generates especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpened mask works on the contrast of the edges. actually, it is not a bit really psychovisuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three, because he really improve the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its use and has various parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalised pictures need a correction of sharpness. this is the same phenomenon to be applied to a common color. this is the same phenomenon to be printed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras need more than normal levels as normal cameras for privacy.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG images a camera is widely applied in internal sharpening. pictures in the raw format, we must always have to be used throughout processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner apply a sharpness filter already during the picture of the picture. when you activate this deactivate, check control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain necessary results by using a photo using sharpening material removal. you can call with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should be careful when the results are not very natural look: sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but increasingly also the noise. in general, you will reach it over the menu entry. you will reach more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpens.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite results: a picture is a bit soft. the solution to draw a bit soft. use the tool to the softener and experiment with the menu entry and experimenting something with the settings. the advance on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter decomposite is a very good tool to remove grinding of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help the image. the filament shows the issue of the screen with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often good results and should increase the effect. if you make the skin mask too strongly, smoking and the impression of greats in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a lot of pixel screen on each side of an edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radios. you should therefore sharpens pictures at the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the respect image which is added to the original. this will set the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB values and to apply difference. it can therefore be defined for a lower difference between the pots of sharpness, except therefore Schönness error in facial, Himmler and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp filter. the original image is the (1) and this image has been used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & dignam; tool refocuses on improves a picture through improving the sharpness. it used to assessly protected the copyright fillet filters -Algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to navigate a picture to & quot; in which it's a better approach to sharpens. this is using a tool named FIR Wiener Filtering. the use of a sharp mask. refocus will usually reach better results as unsharp. you can start colors from the menu by using colors refocus on the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw is much better than the pallet's folding. the Gauß 'sche folding has a very long tail, depending on the source code, which is far away from the original cross and so far, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß' is influenced in most cases, even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. the unwanted results are caused unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the most important parameters for the use of this module. it is the most important parameters for the use of this module. you can set a higher value if your picture is very unsharp, but then you should pay attention to sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: enhancing correlation can help reduce arisation. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values are close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation is reduced to the visual effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of noise filter can help you reduce arefficients. however, values above 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter can be too low, & eg; 0, the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value is even more contamination.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß 'sche sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß' s sharpness. use this parameter if your uncious filter is caused. in most cases, you should use this value to 0, so you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformatrix. if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß '. however, the module is very slowly when you choose large values for these parameters. in most cases you should choose a value of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The store as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any popular reproduction parameters will be stored for later and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module, before you change the image on the other hand. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately, but later they leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you can read pictures and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">General Produces unschemes masked better results than sharpens. this could be caused by reason a greater neighborhood use as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always produce arcerpts. even under optimal conditions it can never make the effect of the unparalleled filter. practically it is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters always at least the same as the unparalleled mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better for processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">At the bottom, you can watch a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For further information on the methods of the responses in digital bilites you can read technical data in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glory is set out the sharp edge of the surface, to generate a natural puplighter.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows a adapted color to the pupille. if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool provides several counts as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available settings are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details pondering [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass. a value of 0.9 should be details so that no sharpness is required. please note that the details should always be subject to the guiding dependent.</seg>
<seg id="520">Basic efficacy of alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothed in all directions, while a value is very similar to 1 in one direction. if you have a film paper or CCD noise, a very high value of similar pattern generate. JPEG Arteete will be eliminated at a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this set the maximum smoothing factor via alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regular control signal: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher of this value is necessary, the more will be smoothed when it's hard to estimate the geometry of image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulance effect, he must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm run through. usually this is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle gradas [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is selected, it should also be chosen. NOTE that small angles should generate a long runtime. you should make this value as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integration width increments [0,1, 10]: integrable stride width in pixels. you should avoid small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never be larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the quality will use the quality which you will receive by selecting this option is only small. but it doubled the runtime. we recommend it to allow him to allow it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons are mirrors and load this. every setting of image errors can be stored here in a text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors can be comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see as picture error with small artefacts. the module is applied to a photo that is created in Guatemala City with an analot camera in the foreground that caused by a poor film during the journey to see and the original image is under (1) and this corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & dignam; roughbeam is a very powerful tool to reduce Bildrauschen. it uses an urispensable algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selected educational filter to remove spots and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair in the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects from imported images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you will need only the window details and the window-window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, of 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can be used through the radius of the range through the image and the color in it is smoothed and with the smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Focus: controls the sharpness level. this value requires the pixel pitch of the filters according to the front. if the value is too high, if you need to change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can't get more and noise and smell again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Kanten: controls the edge accuracy of the filter. if it is too strongly, the frequency response can be removed or smoother points. set him on a value near the Maximus if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminescent sample of the picture. we recommend you either colour or luminance to improve your image. these settings are not subject to the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of picture. we recommend you either colour or luminance to improve your image. these settings are not subject to the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma value of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas which are typically stronger. it does not polluted the attends.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phasenjittering. this value defined as fast the adaptive filter radius at variations of the luminance if it is too high, can occur if it can occur at his minimum, smoking and phazenjitter can occur at edges. it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are using exactly this. all parameters used for noise, which you have set, can be stored in the file system and later on.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and this corrected with (2). the noise reduction was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture of a crunchy for your purpose. to draw a bit more simple than a picture. use tool to softly and experiment with the menu entry and experimenting with the glass. the advance on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools developed by photographic file.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very good adapted to remove Gauß 'sches, film paper, cratzer, compression artisies, and later digitalised digitalised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and gets the content as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text forcement, the text message is carried out with another tool, the aspect ratio was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are in uncompressed image. this setting should be correct.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons are mirrors and load this. every setting of photo-restoration may be stored here in a text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce as a photo with equilient noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a minolta (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film pieces on the faces. the original image is under (1) and this corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example for the photo restoration. this time, Textures can be read on an old color photo taken with a scanner. you can see the Scan Artefakte from the Scannerlighting and photopia paper. the original image is below (1) and this corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & dignam; tool Hotpixel are allowed to remove hot pixels from photos using a CCD camera, eight were using Algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression comes on a built-in substitute for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will recognise automatic hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important to record the dark image directly to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to the correct picture. please note that the assistant to be the last dark image, and this will automatically return to the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you in the image the result. the case shows the issue of the film with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all sizes.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the Filters. then choose the best filter to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirds: it will be an average of the neighborhoist pixel. it is assigned to all defects in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels at a distance of 1 from the pixel block, are pulled to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of Linear Curves (1-dim). these are used to interpolate the defective pixel inside block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block will be reduced to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is used to interpolate the pixel in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pulled to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) to interpolate the defective pixel inside block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and longer exposure, applied. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and this corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignestiering Correction is a tool to be corrected, i.e., tealight corners, one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially the middle and large photo format, can be often exposed to the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of image by removing the light to the sensor there. TeleObjectives have also shown this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also does drawbacks. many Center filter need a factor of 1.5 or 2 while shutter filters, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be able to use with Center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise unprofitable effects will arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large coating areas of today's Filmentions and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by an acidic transformation of a raw material that is made without these filters. the scope of use with a Centerfilter is being protected against an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignetting Correction Filter and with three further the exposure of the target body.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light effect at the point of the largest density of filters. the standard density is 2,0, resulting in a optical filter with an aperture adjustment of 1, or randomly an optical strength of 2, kidneys, reduce the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignesentation, reduce it to compensate a small degrees.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukness, Contrast and Gamma settings: the processing of a picture with the Vignetisation layer reduces the LEDs of pixel. you need to adjust the exposure of the target data with these options, because you have to increase the settings only.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to use a hostile of exposure to the target of target, then let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma on zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the desired picture in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a lamp diffuse and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & dignics; linking-distortion is a tool to corrected the effect of spherical lentils on photos. it uses an urispensable algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric ortion. colour distortion can't be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The second degree is treated with the general geometrical distortion of lens and can concave the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grades has a similar way-effects, but flattened into the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth grades corrects the distant corners opposite the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric ortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second Grades. with negative values, tonnenical ornings can be corrected and positive values of kissenic distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controlled the strength of the distortion fourth grades. this value increases stronger than the edges than in the center of picture. for most lentils the 'corners parameters of the parameter of the parameter is generally used.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the picture shows the image size and leads to an Correction first size. negative values are enlarge while positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Upheaval: this value adjusted the brightness into the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values it increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated by the dialogue with a preview of the distortion Correction. the values you are using for your image, stored in the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">Tonnes- or kissenic correction should be carried out prior to all additives or size changes. best you have to cut this correction as all first. if you have a picture to cut and after that a tonnal correction would be the effect of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to show you this tool for vertical and a horizontal relief line. move the mouse pointer to fix the lines on this site, and press the left mouse button around the lines at this point. in the connection you can correct tonnes- / kissenic distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you corrected a kissenic distortion, the resulting image has black corners. you can remove these dialog boxes using the image processing or via Zoom Regulator this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the tonnenical correction from the front, frame and paintings are the perspective such as frame, frame and paintings. notice that if you keep the camera with the hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnenical correction to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and this corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website, which produces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters, film paper and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option to adjust film paper and film sensitivity. the ISO regulator is changed the amount of film pieces and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filters can be mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make any sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the Farbinformations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infra-red fillet on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and this worked image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type Aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicam; filter film gritt is an easy to use film screenshots like e.g. B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of the films to increase the manufacturer large silver grains of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grainy impact gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past. if you want to see this special, gallery artigen, rhinestones, grainy view especially to your monochromms photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control of the intensity and granularity of the baskage. the default value is, although often higher values are required to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film grainy impact on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil paintings. it uses an urispensable algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & dignam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil paintings. nature photos and styles are good for these effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two shelves to influence these effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five out. thicker brush is better for large pictures. smooth, the glucose or, from the other side is considered to be hinder.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and this is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Glory 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicam; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gradient to create a carbon dioxide. this is not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen you to catch him.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two shelves with a value range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top regulator selects the sticks size and the lower is adjusted to the contrast (smokes).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal directories. the original image (1) and the amended picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved due to adapting the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicam; filter engraving the picture in 3-D, when it was marked in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicam; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. he works especially the most important content in pictures. the filter uses differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey, mondarling landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, the default setting is set.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the image used image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork with distortion effects. it uses urrectly protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Oil blocks 1: divides the image in the cells and makes it look like if it appears through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogue to the wavy blocks 1 is distorted the image here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork with accidentity effects. it uses urrectly protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Following: comparing the picture along a globular lines that go out of a center. this simulates the implications a zoomed camera, thus produces a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale notes: linked the image by turning the pixel to a center. this simulates the implications of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance probation: do the image to generate the effect of a non-focused camera system. the object seems back to the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of movement: linked the picture by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the implies of a bit moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Wheat grains: wiped the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones. this is ideal for creating the romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle hot.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelsharpened: linked the picture through random translation of pixel and simulates the implications of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Specifers: finds the Farms in the image and know this without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and created it, through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice small tool to make Regentrops on your image. this makes it possible to make your pictures a ngreat look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn urberally protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Tropical size allowed it to change the size of the drip size. since the drip size does not need to decrease the size for small pictures. number of drops and density of drops. fish changes to the optical effect of drop in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep using & digikam; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the range, e.g. a face that will be freely recommence. if you reboot the filter, the range is free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the knob Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the picture is the wrong orientation, you can bring it by spelling or turning into the right orientation. tools are located in the transforming or transforming spelling.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge one photo in a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A painting is simple. the big question is, how you can find a painting and how you can find a picture? how can you find a lack of information or guess? the Cimg algorithm is used here, makes it a good job. try him and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose the dimensions change in menu and enter the target values. dialog is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change the size is used a linear interpolation method to enrolling the pixels. if you want a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. split Interpolation to enlarge picture. & digikam; using a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, when entering the new size, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regular control signal: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher of this value is necessary, the more will be smoothed, because it's difficult to estimate the geometry of image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulance effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and store are being used exactly. every single conversion for photo can be stored as text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast at what it makes, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load. you can break the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below a example for photo blow by using a small color picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3) is the result of the linear enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only one frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently estimated tools do not need to create a picture with the mouse, just push the mouse button and tightening the rectangle with the mouse. you will see this spell then see the mouse while keeping the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you leave the mouse, the field of photos will be cut off. thus, you will receive a good overview like your photo after the cutting edges. you can create the size of the right-to-cutting edges. a new rectangle you can go easily with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the cut-cut button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the Entries to store or file Save file to store the newly designed picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the forefront area you can change the size of the rectangle with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you defined in the dialog, remains in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool to an aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or horizontal format. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and in the horizontal format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool to add a relative aspect ratio. that means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you use cm, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to be automatic horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog can be set down in the dialog with the maximum ratio to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool To add the aspect ratio saves the next time, depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are stored as default values in terms of orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data will be played and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compilation support enables help to set up your images, so that you have to set your images better:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the Drittelregel, harmonious triangles is a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Gold middle: the golden center is a division that focuses on different natural growth, such as the Spiral of Nautilus Muscle or the Blades of a Sunflower. it appears in all possible things which we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrationale number 1,618033988... and it was used to make your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you used your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is pointing out of the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number after 1 is the golden center. the standing research is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered the visual harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center represents a liquid aid lines if you set a picture in the middle of the surface. these sightings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring your goal good results for your photos to achieve the golden spiral line through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the multi-axis along the line of spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the right corner of gold spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should be something that the eye is turned into the center of the composition. this thing can be one line or different objects. this thing can just be done without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles is also taken from the top of gold spiral. their failure are the middle of the sides of the golden sepulsion. NOTE that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equally tiny triangles. diagonal to these lines can be an static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles using your frames, you create a effect of the professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try your picture focus on one of the secuting and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach any other information.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal split and vertical nails can be used to reflect the harmonious particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colours and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this type, you can adjust the colour of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a picture, then it happens to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where the things are turned towards an angle. you can select that with the & digicam; image processing and tool-free rotation. choose the free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degree. with the button default you can set the shooting again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of image will be shown above.</seg>
<seg id="664">At your help, the module is free a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image show around the two lines you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjusted the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have turned an image in the corners, you will find unwanted holes in the corners. one way to repair it is the function of transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">A nice way to cut the picture is the function of automatic additives. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliases smoothed the picture a bit after turning. notice the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivities are performed to a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the center of picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recharged. on the right side of the dialog you can help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new picture, including the empty areas which have been created through the transformation.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas which were created by the transformation.</seg>
<seg id="672">At the top: shows the current angle in degree at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the top: shows the current angle in degree at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">At the bottom right: shows the current angle in degree at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">At the bottom right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adjustment of perspective the picture will be a bit dirty. for a single adaptation, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have changed the perspective, you will get unpleasing triangular holes on the corners. one possibility of this is the picture with transform decoration from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can launch this module with transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissing your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you can press the default, the angles can be reset to zero. a preview of the Effective will display you and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed right from the board field.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you get a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to a key point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines you can now adjust the switch tool to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the picture, the picture is a bit confident. for a single damage, this effect is usually negligible, but two sings generated twice as much, so you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the failure, the picture has a nice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is the picture with transform decoration designs from the image processing.</seg>

<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphics in & Kate; to open graphic and graphic viewer; in a & Kate; -component is open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading by large graphics (currently there are problems over 1000 knots and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & graphic viewer; is a & kle; program that requires the & graphical; -tool & dot; for display of the graphics cards. need to be used in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the open graphic, each in a own lower window. at the beginning, if you start & cold viewer, the main window is empty as the symbol file, and the (empty) list Last modified files. click on the first symbol to display the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have chosen one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the lower screen photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, a look at the corner is displayed if the graph is bigger than the character size. you can select a fixed position of this overview or select that position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and without special fasting, left and right at pressed & Alt; -button);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zoomes is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below, you can see the maximum adjustment of a graphic.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the straight viewers in & graphic viewer; charged file has been changed from another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be reloaded, or whether you want to ignore the change, so that the decision to be ignored. if you want to change your decision later, you can also use the menu item as a graph-viewer, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you can open a Graphite outside of a running & graphic viewer; Instance, & eg; in file browser or at the command line, you want to open a new & graphic viewer; Instance you want or to inviting graphics in a window of the ongoing instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option you can store your choice, but do this also change with the alignment dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the program boot, you can open all the graphic presentation of your final session. again, you can record your choice both and change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph will be split into multiple sides. the horizontal and vertical pages can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using several sites, you can choose whether the parts of the graphs are to be set on this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the page may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several sides distributed graphics without head line and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The site again provides the possibility to define the behaviour if a file is changed, and eg; from another program. you can define a standard behavior (automatically re-upload or the program can be ignored) or the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page open the possibility to specify the behaviour of & cold viewer. if a graph is open outside of the current session. you can open a default behavior for this case (the graph in a new window, or in a window of the current session) or determine that each time is being asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The site meetings are the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & cold viewer. you can specify a standard behavior (the files in the last session or not) or determine if you want to be asked.</seg>

<seg id="749">Here you can choose among various viviviz; -Layoutalgorithms select. the entries, as they are described on the web site of & graphical; are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; -Algorithm, the standard for the judicient graphs. the Algorithm puts the edges into the same direction (from top to bottom, or left to the right) and then trying to produce a short edges and as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; -Algorithm is the standard for ungerized designer. he produces representations in accordance with the springent model. thereby the Kamada-Kawai algorithm uses the same as a statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; -Algorithm generates a springreturn model -layout. it uses the fruitman-reflexo-hyporistic, and includes a multi-basket for the treatment of large and faded graphics.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm specifies the node circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Meadow, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layoutcommand. the command should accept the Graphite file as parameters, and the calculated layout of the graphic command you can change & eg; the graph with a filter change, or even the graphics with a filter change before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graphen (judged or unglazed) and turns the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for the judicial, & neato; for ungerized graphic).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is activated, the overview is indicated if this is necessary. otherwise it is not shown and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows the meaning of what is the -mouse pointer. click on a & GUI; -element to obtain additional help on this item (if available).</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module to geographical locating GPS coordinates are allowed to add the metadata in the metadata. the geographical data are stored in the EXIF-stiched picture and localization can be displayed in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module to geographical localisation tools are available to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you will need a GPS track as XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Fig. Geographical localisation correlator. this interface can lead a number of selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Choose the pictures you want to correlated in the main window and call the menu. to download a possible correlation above time and localization through time, you need to load a track file with GPX file, this file contains the same time to the same places like the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded automatically, the coordinates must be recorded in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore, the camera will be converted to GMT. this can be carried out with the time zone. place here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The deviation for the maximum time variance indicates an upper abdeviation for GPS time and camera. the deviation of them are related to the data. the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will be correlated to this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't know any suitable data. if you know that in reality a location with a large difference between camera and GPS lies, you can set this limits here and press the button for interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next note, you only need to use the data with the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map and enabling. choose the enter area and ensives you will always be selected. the height can always be selected manually. the card can always be changed manually. the map can be changed from the map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that the exact tool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums the as HTML pages, and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded, UTF-8 encoded with the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tool has to select four riders in which the settings can choose to select any albums. the albums are not select hierarchically. the albums will not choose a large number of albums. in the area among them, the Albenchschau and the text of the page will appear in the head of HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side. this rider is largely self explanatory. if you then click on a picture, a new page is opened in which the picture is displayed directly to your standard picture, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be stored in all your images. choose a folder with the name KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything that will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">In case you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information will also be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth, you can change the default color depth. the file also influences the file size. all other settings are explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Reiter attachers allows you some of the settings from the record rider for the demonstrators that are displayed little pictures that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A sequel window shows the user to break the user as far as the action. press abomiting the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module produces the pages will not be closed automatically. you can thus read the program messages. the web browser will automatically take place at the end to display the preview of the gallery. press the module to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view pictures.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows him to perform a selection of pictures and run on them basic operations such as rotations, zoom or translation. it was designed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture of default is shown in full screen mode. this may be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG format is a tool to change images without your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store images in JPEG format, to save pictures in JPEG format, without any loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is the file size, as no compression of the Farbinformations are taking place. these can also be found at PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Module Digital Camera-Client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI Module Digital Camera Klient has no documentation. if you are interested, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI teams under kde-Imaging @ kde.org. attention: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailinglist kde-Imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from a picture to another copy. then choose the file selection dialog when you want to copy the image sequence, so the image will be copied to the metadata. the data will be copied to the button.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in every target format. JPEG is working in writing. please refer to exiv2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in form of a dip.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodiers can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video, with a defined length to convert. this module uses the packets of Mjpegtools and ImageMagick. you can also add a audio file in MP2 or WAV of the Digestau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All pictures will be scaled automatically for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the Diaschau. this module allows you to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD to your DVD player. to burn the media you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are packed into MPEG Diaschau. after that you can start over on Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures are shown below image files in the portfolio. there you can also modify the pictures or modify the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you plan to select the file from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely to choose the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of the picture process is set to them below. a low value creates very abrupt, a high contrast very smooth movements.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as the next article. in doubt you should leave them black. the name and the path of the generated file you can specify below the name of the mpeg file. keep it possible to keep the divorce mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you have an audio file under name of audio source file, this will be integrated into the film. after all adjusting your requirements, you can easily drink the creation of the film. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go fast or into your rest a coffee and drink the Diaschau when you return back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that codiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages on the right down below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant allows several pictures on a sheet paper together. the combined pictures can be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: sensible to improve you or with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your digital format stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command lines of the command of Dave Coffin. an original quote from Ihmist: do not expect the same results as the software from your camera eller. sometimes you get the dcraw results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can look at the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now turn the values to optimize the values, whether the camera settings can be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can continue to process the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG Switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview you can select one of the three output formats and the file name remains similar, and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG has been used one loss of algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information of your picture and uses the lossless LZW Compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you have frequently asked their images often or later on the other hand, you should not use the JPEG format, as it is only a limited number of operations allows you to keep the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">In case you can choose JPEG as a memory format, the metadata included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted to your settings, you can start button to start button. if you want to break this process, you can break off this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacker processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to one time. use this mode only if you are safe, e.g. through testing on a single image that are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, this is helpful if this was produced in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available. the advanced bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all pictures in an album. it uses the convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for rename of all images of a album. you can set prefix, the starting number and timestamps can be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several pictures of a picture collection. it uses the Convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can use the image to be smaller or enlarge. in addition, four types of images are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of picture is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): dimensions change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional magnitude in two dimensions. the aspect ratio will be changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepare the picture for photo printing. the user can set the print resolution and size of photopapiers. the target image, includes background size, Random size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images in advance. other pictures can draw on the list of sending paintings and put there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the images will be displayed with you selected pictures. via the button, you can add another pictures to you using a file selection dialog. for the last picture, a preview of the right image will be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures to the picture list and add it to the list of sendest images.</seg>
<seg id="875">Using the button pictures, the selected pictures are removed from the list of sendmail images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you selected all pictures you can open the new message with the button. open your e-mail clients. you need to add here the addresses and the subject. you need to add pictures from you selected pictures already as annex.</seg>
<seg id="877">Look not to send a lot of pictures on once. most E-mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e-mails. it might be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send many images.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for the images of the images. their configuration will be stored and will change it again until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Choose your e-mail clients from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service, you must install the GMailAgent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the election of comments in a modified file the comments are inserted into a text file and included the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality will not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original emifers will be added to full pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down the status messages that you can watch out after errors, but you can automatically start automatically at the end. with the knob, you can shallow this window? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After the start of the Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions how you want to depicted your Diaschau. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL passes in the presentation activates very elegant aspect outputs via OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphics card, as the Diaschau is very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename can display the filename, see the filename of images in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option ribbon makes the presentation available in a final loop through traffic. you can break them manually with Esc;</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images applies to this, that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between frames can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transitional effect. you should exchange it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects of which you can choose. random chooses each transition between the images another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diaschau, you can access a toolbar at the upper left screen. move the mouse into this corner to complete it.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar, you can stop the presentation and restart the previous and next image, and stop the Diaschau.</seg>

<seg id="917">& photographic album; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your images. one is written in & kphotoalbum; integrated in & kphotoalbum; built in the following part of user manual, which allows you to create over the HTML menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you need to use some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, each area will be precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of overlooked and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on photographic album, HTML example pages you can see an example for this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">As next, you choose from whether a special photographic album; -export file will be created on the review page. ferry information on export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select that information can be displayed on the HTML page. therefore, you can avoid information that are also exposed to the viewer. for example, NOTE that all pictures are exported. you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain frighnuts.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how to look the HTML page. most adjustments are clearly, so that it is not specially received specially for this.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can adjust various resolutions for the images. this makes those who want to consider your website and monitor the maximum resolution 800x600, no images are supported, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time. it can thus be configured to see your images with a lower resolution, as well as it would like to obtain a picture in larger resolution, it can be confused to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, place the different folder and URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select your HTML files for all your HTML files and a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you must select the principal folder, in which all your pictures are stored. this file will be stored and when you need to specify the memory location. here you can select either a file or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if you have created this really all for viewer. if you have created a web browser, after the pages were created, the URL that will start here, should start this file. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If you are not yet to copy the files created by you using HTML files not in final destination. this is not to specify the final target of the files, but the subfolder of the current files, but the basic file in which are all subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described setup possibilities have moved all three based on base files or URLs. in these, a subfolder, whose name you specify in output files.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are searching for a family celebration, a conference or anywhere else, you wish to create a HTML page to view the images. if you are already much time, the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work is not yet able to make this work yet.</seg>
<seg id="932">You can export your images into a .kim file, you can import a copy of your images in a .kim file. you can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. you distinguish it in the file only a linking to pictures or whether in the file only a link to pictures are that you have set all images into the file, and can be transmitted to this file. the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim -file either directly from the menu to export... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim -file looks for pictures on your way. first, the pictures of the .kim file are not found. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML-export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog allows you to export the export of pictures you can export via the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it must act at internal or external .kim files. there are the following three choice possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="938">At option of manual in the .kim file, you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copied to the .kim file proximity to the .kim file, the images will automatically be copied for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zipped files. since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG, and the XML file is worth it not really worth the files. if you want to define it, then select the option of export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximum image size. when you send your friends images, the pictures may not be larger in full size, as the .kim file is otherwise very large. here you can say that each picture should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file using celest.kim from web browser or from the menu to select importer..., will be photographic album; the export database was described as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to the importation consists of four steps. first, you need to select what pictures you would like to import them into the file the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category of the people to imported the staff (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked to be imported in the third dialogue window, which will be imported in the third dialogue window, and these categories of the database correspond to the database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the selected database with the categories of your current database. an example of this you see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to search pictures and view: if you look like pictures, you would like to see pictures within different picture groups & mdash; if you want to discover images of your Italy vacation, you might want to see all images that is depicted on this boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps from (1) connections for information about your images, via (2) the search and see, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today takes care of your videos. many places in this manual is spoken over images, but often bad videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photographic album; save all his information in the file index.xml in the top folders of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in the CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">And photographing the folder, in which your pictures are stored and used this in future start. if you want to start a different database with pictures, you can start up a different database. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">More about the menu entry settings; set up... go to a window, with which you can change the settings from & kphotoalbum. in the following section of user manual, you can be explained in the following section.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call settings the preview and options for viewing the viewer. for each setting it is available through a button on the F1 button and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you, as you can define for each picture different properties, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On check the dialog that is used to work already existing groups. for each existing groups you can select a labelling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories, subcategories were already mentioned in the dialog option. for example, all members of a group will be set up in a group instead of all groups of a funding instead.</seg>
<seg id="956">In you see the setup possibilities you can choose to set your disposal of members. you can select the category to select the category. in the left window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>

<seg id="958">The modules can be called by the modules. the modules can't be described in this manual, as they are not part of & cold photo. they are not sold separately. most modules have a help of the modules, which you can call over the modules yourself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules were used together with multiple applications, it may be tested that the modules are used with the demo database; just before you can call it on your own pictures - Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu. tell you, I would not have been warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules about KIPI common, are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage when you divides with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photographic album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is an album simply a file. also when & cold albums; this type of order is not supported, simulates the functions using & photographic album.</seg>
<seg id="962">In addition, simulated & photographic album; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, i.e. all images that shows you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>

<seg id="964">If you record, your browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then the entry of this category is a record for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be specified as a category for virtual albums, if you have set the category for virtual albums, for example, if you have chosen the category for example, if you have chosen for example, if you have selected persons to view and the module.</seg>

<seg id="971">In you see three lists with a text box by using people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & photographic album, as you can always use them back when you enter information on your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the shifting the pictures within the list: if you are depicted for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons can be depicted, so that the names listed above are shifted upward, those individuals will be faster and orded.</seg>

<seg id="1042">If a picture with only one beam each pixel is applied, there are often a moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, sometimes they are not shown in the representation of smaller than one pixel. this effect is aliased.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technique called Anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these error. generally, pictures with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you place anti-aliasing, calculates and connects to Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive methodds; adaptive because the super sampling rate is further divided again and adaptive because the recruitment runs from the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method using POV-Ray that exceeds the default threshold value, both pixels are calculated using the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you are calculated using a 4x4 additional points, a grid value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two Pixies is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixels. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixel is split into 4 sub-pixel, which can be followed by persecuted and to further subdivision. maximum depth of the recruits you can adjust with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another ability to be reduced the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you place Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for Quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray; that diffuse diffuse lighting reflexion. it takes a long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust if the alpha channels are calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is clear if the associated strands does not have an object.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values show a precise wire-model and thus a better approximation for the shown objects, but demand more time to rendering. for some objects like the ball can be adjusted for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross a extended projection for enhanced projections, all wire model views are further divided, if the camera will have a extended projection screens. this feature gives a better approach for the projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is depicted. the wall is depicted in a table pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>

<seg id="1072">The action field standard window regulation: shows all existing windows assignments. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window regulation at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of articles shows all existing windows assignments. a new arrangements you can create with the button keys and extinguish a selected arrangement with the button extension.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by name. the name has to be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views of the chosen window arrangement. new views can create and create selected views with the button extension.</seg>

<seg id="1077">So you have straight & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to follow any more knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should make the ultimate way simple scene, while they are very popular: a sphere at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep the following warning lights before you can complain about it that you can only get a black screen as a result, if you use a 3D program for the first time you should see this important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set any camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result, you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you insert no light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything is installed, you can see the following preset window on the first start of & kpovmodeler:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. please read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable performance what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should see the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler, starts with a simple scene. to remove this guide, you need to remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then choose the menu entry. so you have now a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera is considered the whole scene. notably, you notice that the scene from the viewpoint of view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now includes a new entry with the designation camera. if they click here, check the contents of view object properties that can be found in the various parameters of camera. in user documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Please change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions. but note that the camera in the view control points, with which you can change the finish line of camera. click on the left mouse button on a control point, and drag him to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button or the input pressure, the wire-model views and the object tree immediately apply accordingly to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you might add a quader (Insert body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that's a constant method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually a simple possibility. you can use an endless level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plane in the object tree, change the names and press the button, or press Enter. in the object tree, the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view is now also the plain, even at the moment only the limited level. if you render the scene, the plain is extended to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can see the object tree exactly, you'll find the entry for the bottom. you can see the different parameters of the object. in this case you can find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and translation. choose one of these options, change the possible settings regarding the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only you should learn some of these parameters. choose shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Choose the ground to display its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a little bit multiple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog appears in which you can select how the object will be inserted. please select the name in the property name (name = bottom Pigment), with one click on the button preview you can see how the pigment now looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a malt black material because you can still click the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview. give it a lot of possibilities for the pigment. there's many possibilities, but you can now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any colour on Quader and Sphere, click the button on the button and call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is right now. if you render your picture now with a click on the symbol, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you are not the color scheme. you need to have two new attributes. in the color list you need to do two new attributes. then edit this entry two (you can also do more frequently, but the chord-dashboard list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Please select in the object tree in any colour and change the colors in the view of the objects:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already be able to execute the basically the principle of & kpovmodeler; you have already understood. the ball can be just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can change immediately the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget the sphere around the ground. otherwise, the ball would be floating above the ground, as you have shifted the floor around a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the render gives now a strange result: as already before, the ball-surface looks like a sheet black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the sphere, you can now show a material as already at the bottom, enter the sphere no pigment than colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose the first pad and change the name for example in the sphere of pigment. click on the sphere of pigment, then select Single Fabrics and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach an interesting effects if you take the time to display some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screens and click on to use or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings reflection and reflection are already some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: still not selected is:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of it, which offers you & kpovmodeler; we've already learned as much as much, that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a render -method to generate a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene, the Render hypothetetic rays from the perspective of the actuation (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) through each pixel and atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene, and as the atmospheric effects, as for example fog can be processed.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you look at the scene. without a light source you can also see anything, the picture is simple black. apparently, every scene must be applied, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>

<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a possibility to use rough surfaces, without any Beule on the surface individually modeling and without the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is usual to use the same file for a bump-Map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric forms that you can use as modules: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these principles. this models will continue to give them a realistic look.</seg>

<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD predict that your window manager will run the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. for example, we try to assist trouble on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt because these represent excellent development environment.</seg>

<seg id="1500">What codivers / file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer provides a small introduction on Kodiers, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; if not the firmware version of the & CD; this program is not possible to read a protected audio CD; not the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid the purchase of copying protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While they only be done only once (the alignment dialog can be done so often called until a suitable configuration), the daily dealing with a & CD; this will be explained (hopefully) for the slim approach of the user interface, via which you will stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats, depending on which, which are your codiers programs installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from freedent from the internet or can be fully integrated without network, whereby all of them is recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of the commands of the main window. on the side step for step example, further information is used as well as screens with descriptions of the registers for the program of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data on request in the CDDB tab. (this may be locally or online in the latter case, first to be connected to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts the read and - if a encoder in the tab setting is configured in the setup note - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so the option can be read with another encoder as the standard. it's note that previously the encoder in the tab setting is configured.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that a full file can be chosen to encode instead of a full & CD; add to encode and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the alignment dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, piepsen) for programming events (like reading & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main monitoring dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different cards (such as Encoder, to set the encoder). go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, Kodierer and compression rates and helps you to choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is going to go, a lossless audio format is required. apart from FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'Monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available devices to restore these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, they lose information through data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG files are the most common. OGG mag today a slight increase compared to MP3 in audio quality (up to 128 kbps), but above these bitrate, the differences are less important, because both Kodiers are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless free with most distributions free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bit rate), but compared with OGG light, lower quality at a deeper bit rate.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music will be heard from one calculator or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existential OGG cutting machines are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if you also belongs to other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB flash, memory card, hard disk) or special car hi-fi systems. today - at the beginning of 2009, these tools usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and a floating compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setup gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex musicians and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRB. good enough for hi-fi system with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression ratio around 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by adolescents, portable devices and autostereosystems. but not good enough for better hi-fi systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most individuals and most environments, but if you don't necessarily have the absolutely highest quality, you want to choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; informations that will be entered into the program as a list of parameters, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can deliver / used with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to generate a file name and file names as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Related to Kodierprograms, there is often a combination of program settings for the Kodiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the codiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; Title to the words (English: day) if MP3s will be encoded with lame, the switch-board of lame and the title of parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added; the result looks like this: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= buttonnumber in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the freedb is: a free database who can download the information on the audio CDs, so that all other information can download it in the computer. it's note that here only from text will be spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the Pieces & etc;, not by audio-file himself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not attorney. however, no one should say that you are added to the & CD; more or less valuable, so it can't be added to the artist nor the music company. all information can be added in a bet by a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box with another (counterfeit) address than those used in the system. in this kind of configuration, so it seems, the e-mail address of the server is not used (This can only be the programmer who reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries copies the main database. if & kaudiocreator; used to use freedb, the geographically used mirror server will be used. this saves bandwidth on network and resembles the burden between the host.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servern for online Abruf from & CD; Information during the reading of a & CD;. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (generally used monthly) only the updates will be downloaded from the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout programme is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used to try it in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading Audio CD; s. To be aware that the cdparanoia Package must be installed if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the disable WAV files, the codiers and thus select the desired file format. in the first open-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the tab. other codiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codiers package must be installed by using Linux distribution, before the codiers can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined coding. more information about Kodiers are located in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a codiers, further information can be obtained through the command of a command as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many causes. verify the device of the device designation des & CD; / DVD drive, the write and readings of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc für OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are. try to give them both programs with a command line in a terminal. this may indicate a hint to what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not be successful!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have a complete manual read, all understood, but somehow are still unsure what is still not to do something? well yes, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will have enough information krieve that they want to make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, everything setup and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' using a VBR (variable bit rate) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyboards (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as previously compiled packages for your Linux distribution. if it is not necessary to compile the source files. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, what you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to own (eg; by trying to copy a bit anything).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section is treated with the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;, something that is probably done just once.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD;, which must be repeated every one & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the computation for compression of music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are used and what structure is used. because we are faul to use the program to download the freedb & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings, we will probably not be able to read in any reading of a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is provided to the readable program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device designation. if this is not work or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be added to the device with other programs, so helps a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to use existing applications for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card General adjustments. here you can't have much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be specified / entered in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just ask for uncomplete information, so you will be informed if data are missing from the words (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. just both entries. we are comfortable and allow you to download the & CD; data automatically via the Internet of a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">NOTE: this calculator must be connected during reading & CD; it can be connected to the Internet server, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simple, is a & CD; entry found immediately, if you are dissatisfied with the database record and that it can be easily changed with the database entry and the file name, and the directories can be changed with Conqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; taggers.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example is further to note: if you want to manually repair all manual and freedb, if you want to use the database before. however, this is picked about 620 MB, if you have chosen the database mode, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data-upon request, for the Abruises of & CD; information from freedb servers on the internet. how white the system will be given? Read the section on freedb. set everything like it is shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to page freedb.org and look at a mirror server in your proximity. on this way the load will be distributed between the invoice. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work as relate to the server, as many Firemen, the protocol is only 8880 standard, there is perhaps more fortunate with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surfing in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to read data on the freedb servers. the first anchor field should be deactivate enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screen photo. (ensure that the file / f.tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously working pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time at only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author knows it not, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading of the last play: crossed it to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined file for temporary files: if you can read this file, then the path must be stored in which the WAV files can be stored in which the files are not used in your folder. don't forget this folder if you don't want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All such as it is on the screen photo. the command is slightly long, under circumstances a little bit spreads to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo devices. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Notice the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted as required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' divers for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables on the names of input file (including full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of coatric WAV files: at a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tempted to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section is described as described in the reading of the reading of the & CD; on the disk volume, we will be installed in the previous section, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb is described, and the process of this section must be repeated for any exeming & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we can use a & CD; do not include the Screen photos a bit different from than those for a & CD; with successfully supported by freedb; they will learn the & CD; data manually, rather than they get out of the internet. comments are obvious to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find out the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD has to be specified in the drive, which is defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length are listed in the window, as described in the screen photo. this only if the & CD; identified as audio CD; identified and could be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, then look for questions and answers regarding the help or walk back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successful from the freedb, all the title of the pieces already be filled and also will be shown in the name of the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; Key for your & CD; there will select a window, and you can select the database record that your opinion is best for your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on page & CD; settings are selected in the dialog for the settings), you can also get manually from the choice of the first buttonholes in the toolbar. if you don't have any local database, you need to pick the data on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - entering the CD-data and the first piece of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first row of the 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artists do not have to enter the current title 'current title', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of inipha per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments made common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful Abruf of the data from the freedb is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD-Editors, so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name (e.g. all words with large letters or not...), but also to test whether there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">NOTE: in this example, we use ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you are using ID3v2 Tags. this option will be set on the tab card; see a look at the section 'basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can create the Tag information of the generated files later at any time with the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it can also create ID3v2 Tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. check in the help to your codiers to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously with the style of the dispatch CD; in this example, this is not important because we don't exceed the & CD; - for more information, go on the website of freedb.org, and read more information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are subject to rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the choice of 'OK' you return to the main window. click on the line with the second one.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of CD-Editors appears again and you see that the fields of the album has already been completed with the specified data, we just give the entries to the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the unit to each case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and check out the same way up to all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not when you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third knob of the tool bar. NOTE that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Notice that there is a check-character on every row of a piece. only the title will be selected. a simple click on the line, choose the selection of the piece, or select the button All pieces select the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces on the lower edge.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection of the readable process started, this window appears to be confirmation. to OK, then we will see a look at the window with the essays and track what is expected.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you see if you are trying to work with a coefficiently, which you have not yet installed. pieces did not have been successfully tested with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the file for the TMP file and the target ordner are not what we have published here in the example. have you checked if you have write to the file for the temporary files and the target ordner?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the readout of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece of it, he is finished. but we have a new entry: commissioned 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. that may be read and add-in parallel. please note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration adjustment to read this behavior, is the number of parallel processes to read and encode. in powerful machines, the used machine used with a AMD64 seems no problem while reading and encode (from there two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third place is encoded, after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window is blended.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need to your choice your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button in the piece, the entry was foreseen from the menu or press the key arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, choose the collection and clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be deleted. however, it doesn't matter if they are stored at the leaving of & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily needed for synthesizer which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events will be translated into events that uses the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example you can create a MIDI-Map which converts all events of the type change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type change patch to Trumpet and thus always a trumpet sound, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you do not need MIDI-Map because all Soundcard GM compatible are (incl. AWE - and GUS maps, FM -devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there is no programmes to create MIDI maps. you must have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite singer).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that require all necessary requirements for the play of a piece of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. the precondition is, however, that each recording have a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP "name of keymap"... END define KEYMAP "A further keymap"... END define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define it is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and END, that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail to do so in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not compatible with General MIDI-MIDI.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as specified as the Patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard are depicted. the general use looks like:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is thought that the GM-patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all tones used to lay down the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is supported by the sound (e.g. sound 60), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which allows you to create a pistol net. this is the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is playing with patch 127 (cloth surplus), patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the clay 60, regardless of which sound is at the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Drums patch included patch included in which each tone is a different percussion instruments (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;), and not the one that means the clay pitch of the same drum means (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify as sounds at a certain canal or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As described by the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as their predecessors. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define for each channel and instrument several keymers. you must use only in the first line of different names.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymye are all used to trainees at the percussions-channel trainees. look for example the supplied keymers.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to trainees some channels down to other trainees. if you want to make the first and second channel, make it easy to make this very easy at CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need 16 or 9 channels).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is used on the channel N is used. if you are using the keymap option, if you are using the Keymap option, all events will ignore the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">Option ForcePatch can be useful for example to use always the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio gives to be multiplied by the pitch bender events. if a MIDI file sends off with the value n, this is converted with the formula (r / 4096) and then the value is 4096, thus in the Map-file (as decimal number).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM gives out a keyboard that is a pitch bender event. unfortunately, but try some keyboards for two sounds up to one octave. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu below settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The sewer view is a window with a full range of cavities (one for each MIDI-channel). on this way, you can see that sounds are only played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain canal. for each channel there is a evaluation level, where you have changed a instrument, lightens the button not more green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The sewer view (until now) has two different views to display the interpret tones. view the settings below the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD displays the speed to be played with a song. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find e.g. you can find a song to follow the text, you can slow down to the text, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about it, like a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices to very different results, the same as two different musicians can play on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can nihilated zwingen, & kmid; to use. however, a typical MIDI file requires a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; they have control over all.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, DEB) of & kmid; have been compiled. to solve this problem, you need to download a source distribution and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole file to a collection, but I don't want to add all files.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To be understood, so it supports & kmid, drag & drop. open the file that you want to add in & conqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activating the collection of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can claim the arrow button on the left from Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard speed, you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kle; -working area a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this way I would like to play if the collection is at the end or I want to play a file, merely go to the & conqueror; -windows to change and the desired file to the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you don't want to listen to a file, if you add just a file, put the setting of automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file will be published to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have to play the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. not only want to play the first file. so you will set the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you complete, also B.mid and C.mid, and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all thanks! when I see these songs or the postcard, animated me to program on & kmid.</seg>

<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this re-dispensing in configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured through manual processing of file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. this is an example like a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>

<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data records) in the kmplayer, the dialog appears under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. you should be found ports to be selected from which one is chosen. that can be used to use it (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name has probably contain a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of displaying video devices under Linux is only supported. this is also, the videoforlinux extension refers to the X server must therefore be functioning in his configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog appears above in & quantaplus; window to launch and check the TagXML. to select another dialog appears to follow its easy instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, checking only in the load XML files in & quantaplus store.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family of 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; -element from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the filename for this TagXML file is Shema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2026">A action can be fixed with settings... to be created. click New Action on the same dialog:</seg>

<seg id="2028">The easiest action. can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the promotion, this text is inserted into the current Cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful shareholders. with the help of these action, external applications can be started (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantitative; yourself are the quickstart -dialog or the various See in... Actions for (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed to use the% script.sh. this way is suggested to use the% script.sh. on this way: global script file: $KDEDIR / scripts in their path: $PATH. there are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% PID: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; -process will be replaced. if by & quantaplus; this text is unique to the PID number, this is useful if DCOP is used to control the control of & quantaplus; the external script will be used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the enumbated methods, a script input of & quantaplus can take part in the standard entry. in the evaluation level can be determined to send the default values. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document will be sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the application can also be diverted. there are two types: normal output, which is written down to the default edition. it can be specified, which is set up to the default issue, by the value that the evaluation level is set to:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create any group of own toolbar. in particular case it is not too many, therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">As soon as a tool bar is added, you must add action and configure. choose the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this fan are fairly self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill all the necessary fields and add the day to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the day attributes and you are planning, activate dialogue "day," when available, adding a input while action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is the tiny symbol. who should consider the action in conjunction with this icon? replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the promotion is better represents, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & kmenu;, graphics further programs (or where else is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to understand what the action does, but also all the other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I've decided to create a start button as a symbol. due to the use of green (green is usually regarded as undless, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message for users can be entered; -per day in the current document will be entered.</seg>
<seg id="2048">According to the creation of symbol, it must be connected to the action. this happens over the menu with settings... (in & quantaplus;) and choose the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Choose the file, in which the stored symbol is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">If you continue to push the button, press it with other tags, so there's still, or confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some usual & quantaplus; - functions to the toolbar must be divided into several groups. open the toolbars in several groups. open the toolbars to set the toolbar toolbars. make sure that the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separators (left top) for my toolbar. after the selection of the element that should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow request to the right. this adds the element to tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to access a quick way to access the Conqueror Preview. I will select it and add to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separators wanted to support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar, could believe that the & conqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by prostitching all symbols to ensure that everything worked.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the proper file. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored in the right file, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the right file. please adjust the tool bar (s) if a file is opened by the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the mentioned evaluation expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for script language or the formatting language. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; Documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might check in & quantitative; -Repository if any one has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search a existent documentation for formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we have to leave you for the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # 1, tage.html-2 = tag2.html tag1 = tag2.html tagn = tag2.html day 3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section Tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentary section. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation here:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc = php42 / # top level elements, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... basic syntax = language.basic-syntax .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">NOTE the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. it shows that there are no known border with its own content. there is no known border for the chess competitions (except through the verge) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">NOTE that the contents should not be referenced directly to a file (and is advised at the upper end of the building view & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Empty spaces influence nothing but look up & & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resources. files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The ingredient is the range of docrc file, which is for example when writing a & PHP; for example, when writing about Ctrl; H for context-help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the text list (ContextList) and file binding files.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of using separate text elements which should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc file and save up to $HOME / .kde / share / Apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a file (such as you have indicated this file docrc file as docrc file and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and it is worth, send your docrc files using a description of important information, such as documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantitative; -community. they are not rich, but we are proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative; you are not alone. it is possible to divide resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do that:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else which are sent. in different places there is an email message, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbars and folders in templates and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be loaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them as correctly and useful for the publication. to signifying what a GPG / PGP key needs. thus, the source of resources guarantees, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are being asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase will not be stored), or in the case that you have several keys, you can be completed in the dialog for a new resource (URL preview can be empty) and with click OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP) to load tool bar tool bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantitative; the integrity of resource has been warned to notice. if the integrity is given and the resource can be signed correctly, a message appears with the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work with XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, the preparation can be needed to work by using a DTEP files. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD option. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that is to be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP, will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quantum / dtep file.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitions: the string set in! DOCTYPE Day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after the conversion: if enabled, scores & quantaplus; after the conversion of the newly created & DTEP setup, which can be adjusted to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key designs. to understand these to understand and full advantage of & quantitative concepts. this chapter attempts to give them exactly these concepts, without understanding & quantitative; little benefits are browned.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this differentiation concerns a range of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; are available. from toolbars over actions, everything is marked, in the common file-structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure machine, actions and samples in the global tree, which can be available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of WebDevelopments for a single user. these are customized patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user directory, allowing them to use only this user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project related elements are available within a certain project. that can be set up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a certain project. all elements are set in the lower part of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: editing window, the construction views, the box points with info and the toolbars. please turn in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the key figures with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document validation, such as close by current, other or all card tracking, download or upload document to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Recorders in the editing range lead to another accounts of documentally, such as basic processing step (add / copy / Insert), arrangement of under the mouse pointer or opening the file, if the string is called under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editors of Editors. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is being shown as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to include one day, e.g. & lt; pgt; in their document, then you can add the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert the data for this just the attributes (such as anchor), then you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building view (QIT;) enable it to navigate into the information & quantitative information; to navigate them to opening and to pass through map material, project, patterns, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that presents & quantitative files. this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing files in the project using a right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading, or deleting of the memory media can be carried out with the then expanded console menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program components, a whole website & etc; there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category hangs from & quantaplus; -working area. global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of the recording in Global, Lokal and Project will also be available here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can download the available information on a script file, such as the script will start to work or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view shows the internal structure of active document. by links-Click, the cursor is set to the position of the element. by right-Click, a list of command in terms of navigation and collection of building.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other construction views. with him, manfast attributes and namespaces can change. all the attributes for all available attributes with few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for Web technology for your development. you can download documentation here and quantitative documentation for & quantitative; of the quantaplus; document can create your documentation, and by adding a Ordner doc at a project can be reviewed and considered to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed the best from top to bottom, since B. after the fill of the project called the entire directories for the rest of the project, all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. at the input of Name will be automatically filled out.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative; -project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces using the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine where you want to access local data. either a name (hostname.example.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If this field is empty, the default settings of the chosen log could be used. depending on the adjustment of the remote invoice could be necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2162">It allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project. several files or whole file can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have a static web content you can download and change. with serverside script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you must go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Check-out if files that are located somewhere in the main event of the project, where a project is started anew, not comment.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Using this option, all files and folders will appear within the main folder and you can catch a precise selection of good.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main ordner. you can select the desired files by hook or, through removing the hooks, staples from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant includes three adjustments which allows you to simplify your work. this settings can be changed in the menu space in the menu space in the lower window profiles or with the key-down Shift; F7.</seg>

<seg id="2173">In the window profiles, high-load profiles (see in) can be set up as the display of a building view for each profile, by calling a own building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the window team configuration, project members can be added, processed or deleted as well as a mailing list. see in detail.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the window event configuration, one might change event actions and change these actions, change or delete. event transactions will be carried out if a certain event occurred, as about the sickle of a file. see in detail.</seg>

<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select the project... from the menu Project or the Symbol Open Project open from the toolbar. the dialogue project is displayed and allowed the selection of project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be automatically stored. you will be asked if you want to back any changes ahead, if & quantaplus; modified files. same happens if you invite a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management provides free access to the files in the project. there may be the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">File characteristics are equally, however, the entries must be open and open with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can find different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profils. if only a profile is present, the button is blinded to prevent removing distances.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the core memory and your option is useful if you need to store files if the frequent uploading of files is necessary, and the rather unsecure password on the record option is not taken into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-end profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded on different server. at work or creation of a profils, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server, to copy the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Port for the transfer. normally this must not be changed, except the network administrator has not running a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attachable function, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. if your password will be stored on the plate so that it cannot be read, but each with programming language can see it easy to see it.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple divers, can be loaded, and replace the current files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu or the project tool bar, accessible via the settings of the tool toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjustments to & quantaplus; to own design.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are designed in the best over the toolbars. use and Add to adding toolbars below in the section of toolbars below.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols will be set to be created by using a textiles menu (right click on the toolbar), you can rename other actions such as tool bar, toolbar, rename or toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog, where can be displayed on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the Context menus to a toolbar (symbol) in addition to a toolbar, additionally the entries must remove this promotion and action, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can be set up in menu with Settings toolbars and set settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in the essential document chases, code escalopes and files to link. & quantitative file system with enhanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any of the system existing directory within the board. templates are in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions that allows for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative; included precedstocks have conditions for their use. please read the conditions before using the conditions before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not the purer text. it can be inserted any text except text, so images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc; binary layers are inserted in documents using img src / src / url). some examples can be found in the preset under global templates. further information to the templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. based on this templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple framework for the purpose and organised the work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples can be found in the board tree under global templates. see more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type templates is useful if not a new document will be inserted into the document, but the same text area always should be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system to Javascript or perl basis. some examples are listed in the board tree under global templates. see also for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name suggests, these templates for all websites as templates. they are a collection of several documents that can be organised in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus in a compressed tar archive.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure to taste (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File Report as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it is done, you will notice that (even if it was stored as a project licence), it is not visible in the project tree. look at the steptics under project conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be pulled with pulling and lay down on the construction supervision.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: to copy the file only to a system folder. all file administered functions can be used, e.g. draw and depend or Insert over the file tree by Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">One can select in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder and secure site template, secured a name for the template and secure. by default, it can be stored as local or global inlay.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project conditions allow a very targeted approach. you can add headlines and footlines or dynamics with & PHP; additionally, add files or associated with them. in addition, one can keep some things for use in projects very low in mind in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The setup structure in the window is based on the $KDEDIR / share / Apps / quantum / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / Apps / quantum / templates. each of this file corresponds to one of four types of containers, as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To define the behavior of a folder hand in the template table with the right mouse button on the folder and select the text-menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">An evaluation box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is low as soon as a result attributes versened.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default and fits for everything except the family gatherers in the template. if a regular folder would be explicitly deactivate, unless it would be explicitly activated. in case of a normal file, the Blah would appear with something like this text-module. if nothing appears, you can probably be in a family ordner.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allowed pre-set or reproduced text for templates in this file. that could be general headlines and footlines for all templates in a file with special headlines / footlines a whole presentation already with the appropriate headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, you also have context menu (shown on the right mouse button) via a complete source collection for adding folder or copy and paste of templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the VPL; Editor and the second, the editing window will be replaced in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: he invites you a document as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and when needed to the source code editor in which the implemented changes in the VPL; editor is visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document, the & PHP; it shows a small symbol the Vohandenenits of & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit these directly with the VPL; editing & PHP; there is no plans to change this comparatively.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode just like the first, except that at the same time, the changes in source text editor and in VPL; -Editor synchron is activated and the Cursor in source code is activated in the VPL; editing the key-pressure of the active Cursor of a window to others, whereby the position is retained in document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. -view can be set between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection, the period can be set automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be used for fast computer and a large chip for slow PC.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose, you want to select the title of the website, such is the presentation of invisible tags in work with the VPL; editing is also called, once a new document can be created with the VPL; Editor. that is the device of the hanging code. thus, you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags states the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. impact words for internet search engines. meta elements can be added by pressing the two switching surfaces below or removed. one click on the list enables change to the contents of content, such as keywords in the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new path of the design of the view of the browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change of the list is just like the Meta elements. the work of CSS Rules will not be supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to create a external CSS installation, by adding to the file button and chooses the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is as usual in a word-processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the markings works as usual. text can be inserted into inserted and using the button or removal key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The tags of tags will be made in the same way above the toolbars, as in source text editor, it is not removed if a anchor day, surrounded by text must be surround with text, each other supposing anker can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the tables assistant or the lists-Assistent are deactivated. they will not work on & VPL; in this release, tables or lists are to be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for Compare. why & kdiff3;? let me explain shortly, why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributors had been carried out in many places. another programmer had changed in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts at merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">This program showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly is in these lines. and there was no evidence on the digits, where perhaps only the entry had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences in line and changes to white signs. later, any amount of useful features were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you like to compare this text, simply copy it into the clipboard and add him in one of the comparision window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the Compare and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merges will be fully supported. this is useful, if two persons independent changes in one piece of code and visualize changes in the automatic file. the screenshot can even directly edit the expected result. the screen photo shows three Quell files at merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you complete the Compare and merging complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; the file merges:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and differ for the possibilities of current colorims. if you're commonly verify code, you will like to test this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed in a certain number of white signs, one can see at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no troubles changes more if no man changes the entry.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in a row, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same names, but in different folders, you can make sure the typing work easier to write only the filenames of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner2 file girder kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual transmission to file names, select the selection of file browser (file...) or select one of the file openings. if you have any third file, if you have to leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be done.</seg>
<seg id="2295">If you select a file for the button... you can also choose a file, if you receive a file, then use a file, then used for B and C, however, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other files.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is crossed, the input field is active for the goal. however, it is not necessarily required to define immediately an output file. you can also use this step later in the storing.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before starting with the Compare / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes, you don't want to compare all the file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the intermediate shelf to the active comparision window. the comparison will start immediately. in the opening dialog you can't connect to the dialog easy using the breaking button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and depend: draw a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let him fall on a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind? sometimes it contains a file e.g. several similar functions, if you want to figure out how much of these features would need to create it in & kdiff3; load and then compare these functions. now you can easily add the relevant sections to copy, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">NOTE: currently you can't pull out anything from & kdiff3; only the cover from text to a comparision window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some edit the pulling and deployment of text in another program as a cut and insert (instead of copy and insertion). in such case, your original data might go lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each Textile window is the info line. the Info line contains the characters A, B or C, the file names and the line number of the first visible column in window. (note that Windows C is optional.) you can rest the mouse a while on the line. then you will display the mouse to view the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. A has the colour blue, B and C is magenta. (this default settings can be changed over the settings menu).</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can distinguish this file, the default colour is red. (colour for conflicts in the settings), the colour scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's the next section (merging) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text, the enclosed column. when differences were found, the colour shows the corresponding colour. in some programming languages, the colour is not so important to see the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, B., white signs are only relevant to character and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column of text is interrupted in places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line is activated, the line is broken by broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result-window (below the comparative windows) also has a info line with the inscription issue:, the filenames and [conscience] if you have processed the result. usually, it does already contain text, but often does it contain conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflict is dissolved, the storing is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to the next soldered / UNGEDANCE conflict around the remaining conflict.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparision windows are used, each difference is also to be solved at the same time as a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By one click on the left mouse button in one of the window, the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will not appear. (this will also be visible by the beginning of the group otherwise.) this group is increased with the color display for current area and to the left a black beam appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, if you have any further line more in the group; then, in these lines of the text & lt; No line in the Quellies; then it is only a placeholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps again another source. this text appears not in the final stored file, nor in a mark that you may possibly copy and then.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merging fliers; however, if you copy this text from the list window when you start such text from the list window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">NOTE: if the sources you select the options numbers ignore or Ignoiere C / C + + comments, changes to numbers or comments are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly with the image processing and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard exercise left, right, high, rbelow, side down, side from the beginning, at the end, Strg-beginning and Ctrl-end, look like it can also be used by other programs. the oversight column next to the vertical bar can also be used for navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In Augabefenster you can also use the other keys to work. using the Insert key, you can switch between insertion and handwriting mode. (default is the insertion mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click on the left mouse button in one of the summary columns to synchronizes the view of all windows based on the beginning of the respective group (as already in paragraph merges and the editorial output.)</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar includes seven buttons for navigation using the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous Conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-top), to the next / vorous Conflicts (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-down), do not dissolve any conflicts. therefore, it must be distinguished between dissolved and UNGESOLSTEN conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the stopboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Strg Insert), you'll always copy the option to copy automatically into the intermediate shelf. be careful with this option, but you may obtain the content of the intermediate pboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line of line are stored according to the roundabout operating system. UNIX variants use a line-type\\ r\\ r\. KDiff3 maintains the line files for source files, you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The list and list of the last used files will be saved automatically and re-made during the next start. (menu setting up-up &gt; Kreducing 3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a lettering with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog appears with variable width, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are depicted in italic writing. if the chosen Scriptures are not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be illustrated. in these systems the button provides a unsuccessful color automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, the corresponding number of the tab button introduced the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or Return, the return of the previous line is automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be copied to the stopboard. the manual copy is stored in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select whether line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing Files attempts & kdiff3; first, all of identical lines can be ignored in the source file. only during this first step, white signs will not ignored. the second step is not ignored. even at merging, white signs will not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car backlog '\' at the end of row, but then save files with different sizes in the side-side-side comparison, though they might sound differently. if this option is enabled, the car can be treated simultaneously. while the use must be deactivated. in the default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting, this option deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding character ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default setting, this option is disabled. Changes in comments are treated as a white character.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense even smaller subdivisions. the option is activated in the default setting. it is effective with complicated and large files, but slowly at very big files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Auto-continuing mode, this setting, as long as the result of the selection is shown, before the next UNGEDANCE conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatic all conflict in white characters by the chosen file. if you need this time to time. (default is manual selection.) It is useful if white sign in many files are needed, then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoiere C / C + + -comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options will be treated in the chapter to scans of folders and breakthrough a merging. look for details under documentation to the directory-comparing and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the Suffix .original file. if you have a backup file with the Suffix .original, this will be deleted without additional backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">The language of the user interface. change this option is not the current running program. you need & kdiff3; make sure the change is active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & kdiff3; because the language is set there via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coefficacy settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, it will be used for all entries the upper setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">On the selection design for the coding, a short notice that the local coding is. (this can't be changed here and has been purely on your informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this influences how special characters is treated and be interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, can be compared to different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you arranged a file, you can specify the coding for storing to store.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you specify pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files can not work 16-bit ASCII, but the processing command can only be converted to 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch it off to press review of changes in white signs to the text or review. (NOTE: this is also valid for changes or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoiere C / C + + provisions.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are visible. but sometimes you might only need the differences between two of three files. in normal mode, gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C becomes a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes one would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. keep just the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">The reference window is classified by each other or overlap. this may also be useful for advertisements of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, you consider the differences and decide to execute files. if you use only two files, if you use only two files. if you use only two files. (if this function is used to start merging file, then the name of the last used output file will be kept.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">At reading a file, it will be given first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the issue of command is visible, and not the file. you can also use your own prevention, which allows for out to cut out parts or to corrected the return.</seg>
<seg id="2350">At the reading of a file, it will be given first to this external order. if also a normal precaution command is given (see above), the issue of command is only used only when the command is equal to your own request. every input line has to have an associated output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought-behind is to enable the user to allow users more flexibility when using the diff results. however, most users don't want to program their own self. good news is, however, that in most cases, the good news or perl is fully sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this process cut-out command for line response in large letters to form: SED 's /\\ (\\\) /\\ U\\ 1 /' This text is in relation to each character. the\\ U converts the found text in the first complaints. the\\ U converts the found text in large letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other versioncontrol systems use some key words to insert automatically (info: / cvs / Key _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\ $\\ _\\ $\\ _ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\ $\\ _\\ $\\ _ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\ $\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\ $\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\ _\\\\ _ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you do with my experiment, you might want to understand, and perhaps you like this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignore of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another process cut-out command for line equal. it's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a number, and each number is replaced by nothing, so quasi to be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you would like to perform several requirements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the requirements of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also use something different such as perl. perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / Erase / Switch' All ings are needed at perl some details. where\\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">Data after normal preprocessors are kept for display and merging. other operations known only the data, which sees the line-like algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">NOTE: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessors, the line of the calculation automatically sees the output of the standard Preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as if any function, the text changed or differences, you can not notice certain differences, and the worst case important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often have to edit many files in a file. from this reason you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively compare and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a suggestion: you can adjust the proposal before start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can cause simulate and shows the simulated changes to perform without them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads the selected action either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6-button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the Compare and merging of each files. you need to open only folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three file are merged, Ordner1 is used as the basis. if no goal was specified, used & kdiff3; Ordner3 as target ordner.</seg>
<seg id="2367">NOTE that only the folders automatically starts, not the merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the file informs a small news window over the current progress. if you checked the scan of the folder, only the files are listed that compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning is completed in the file, shows & kdiff3; a listing window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder of the scan was found here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder superstructure will normally be folded. you can use a file, by clicking on the + / - click on the object or transfer the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions of all subdirectories can be open all signposts with which you can open all folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file is started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol appears in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the datatype is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in detail window to the selected object. in such case, the collapse is not automatically elected in such case, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As in the above picture, the colors are used in the columns A / B / C colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical when their entire contents are identical. then the folders is the same colour. in folder, the age is unsignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this colour scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours leaves the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes old.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exists, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exists, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exists, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same date type (e.g. if A is a file and B a file): bug: contradictory datatypes. as long as such defective objects can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same date type (e.g. if A is a file and B a file): bug: contradictory datatypes. as long as such defective objects can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active when only two folders and not an explicitly target numbers are given and if the option directories is active. then choose "kdiff3; the necessary action is that they are identical to both folder. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: merging and the result in both folders. (the user sees only B; directly after the merge file only B; directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two file are merged and select the option of new file (uncertain), then analysed & kdiff3; the date of files and suggests the same date, but the date is identical. if the date is identical.. Solange code cannot be solved, the file can't be started automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While the merge is signposted a file according to the other. you can copy status column, when the merging was successful, and according to other reporting, if the merging is finished, you should see a final review and see if the status is OK.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the alignment dialog, the file comparative method of complete analysis is selected, the number of unsolved, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts is only displayed if three folders will be compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can select either the just selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all computing actions (also in all subfolders), you can launch the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target ordner, then in the three-file merging mode C is used as a target, when two-file merges will be used as a goal and used to synchronize A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have chosen a target file, please check if all entries should be displayed in the target number, also in order to prevent certain entries due to certain entries. check these options to avoid unsweet surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To perform all entries: select directives in the directory or press F7 (the key plush). to perform only the current entry: select the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If through contradictory datatypes still invalid merging actions exist, a message appears on the faultful elements. you can choose a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you execute all entries, a dialog window appears with the options, simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">If you want to see how you want to see what was going to be done without any changes. you will recieve an exhaustive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then take certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merging a single file), then a merging window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready to start with a file, select another directionaries / continue or press F7. if you don't have saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, you will continue to continue his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error, you'll find out a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll be able to try out the cause of problem (F7 key), or kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other way before you continue with the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually merged, scores & kdiff3; this entries must not be confident again. even if you examine the collage, these entries will be ensured when you perform the merge promotion, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kreducing 3...) now has a section called the directory associated with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed on the displayed pattern, are displayed in the element tree. a valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default value is *. file must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, are not shown in the element tree, use the semicolon; as separating signs. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>

<seg id="2500">To make it even clear: even if & kmousetool; pain helps with pains that can be caused by clicking with the mouse, used by the mouse, used by the mouse. and as with all ergonomic help, the result can vary for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movement and leads a mouse click once, once you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart shifting enabled, power & kmousetool; a break, after the end of the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the mouse button. in this way you can use the draw at pressed mouse paste. the smart shifting requires a bit exercise, but you need to reconcise quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This time has to return to the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; click a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If smart shifting is enabled (1 / 10 s) this time is set, the time is set up, the unmousetool. once again, the mouse button is waiting, if there is no lack of mouse, if there is no evidence of mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can move & kle; to move the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go on Sound & Multimedia, select the sound system and here the rider generally. there is a slider sound buffer which you have to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">This setting is marked & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; started. this function is currently only under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window sizes, please refer to rate to figure out how you will start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">All settings back on the values back to the opening of the dialog. have you already suppressed up the button, the settings will be reset at the stand after the last shifts.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular the smart shifting should first be switched off. if you have then click on the automatic mouse click here to share the intelligent consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kle; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should deliberately aware, in which places a mouse click without any effect remains: clicking on neutral constituents of windows or on spots in browser window, which does not represent a link, so that you can use the mouse to such places, until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is printed, you should clean your mouse. it is normally quite simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse hemisphere, but also the rolls that come with the mouse hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take out the mouse hemisphere. as this happens, is different from mouse to mouse. but it should be clear if you watch the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. the Dreck and the dirty, you can easily remove a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breakdown the version of & kmousetool; if you are just a shift process. if in this case the intelligent strokes means that the surgery could not end through the exercise of mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool, use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run yourself a mouse click. thus, the status of & kmousetool will be reset, and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; still click mouse to execute Cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Workaround: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you don't want to use it. but if you don't want to consider the mouse on a neutral range of work, if you don't want to consider that the mouse button for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray surfaces around the toolbars and the menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shifting, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart shifting is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you want to move into the clipboard, to move it into the mouse, and want to move up the mouse with pressed mouse button. but there's probably some problems with the mouse. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent strokes, if you're just start to start at the beginning of the text area a mouse click - and hold the switching to the other end of the text, while keeping the mouse pointer to the other end of the text.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this makes a sound look like a mouse click. so you know exactly what when the smart shifting begins. later you can use the intelligent strokes without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; it must be installed the Xtest extension for & X window; it should be the case for most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is available only when the system has a sound card and speakers and these correctly set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; praises the mouse button once the mouse pointer shortly interrupted. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI Syndrome and is preparing the concrete of a laying.</seg>
<seg id="2527">And kmousetool; also, it may be configured that it is a certain time that a draw weight begins before the mouse button is left out. in this way, the draw will also be carried out with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of business & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filter does not require.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, before he will be sent to the program the preparation of the language dispatcher. you are useful for improving the language, to select false words or abbreviations, to select a matching language and speaker to renew certain terms of voice synthesies and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the work of filtering, it's important to know how the program is "Current dispatcher" with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The issue of Screen Readern has the highest priority. it will be presented to all other orders. if the output of the screen reader is provided, the orders received continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning have the next priority. this stage is important news as & eg; processor will be getting hot. a warning has preceded and holds the issue of messages and normal text. these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the closest priority. a message is subjected to normal text. & thmouth; is an example of an application that can welcome you with & kmouth; someone welcome you to the room. & kd; -Notifications are also News. Read all this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text contracts. each order to create a text order. KSayit is an example for a applications that are made text papers. text papers are intended for the issue longer texts that have no particular look.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except for the issue of Screen Readern. when applying the issue of a Screen Readers, while & ktts; just such a pre-read, this edition will stop and terminated this issue.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of Screen Readors. you will be applied to normal warning, news and text papers as well as & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters the text and give it to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filter are designed as modules. in the future it can still use further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character sets replace parts of a text by other text. that can be set up either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; with pre-defined animation of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Transformer use a XSLT-file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format into another format. in delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT-files to the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With interference-selection filtering, you can send essays depending on the text by text, or depending on the text of the text, sent to a speaker. if you can read the text by KDE news about how you can read the text by KDE news.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter is adjustable rules, according to which he is applied for a voice edition. if the filter does not realize that his rules are unchanged, gives the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -Notifications to & ktts; it will be arranged through all active filter, which is set up on the side below. editing filter takes place in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2638">For the device of animation, you must enter a list of words or regular expression as the same type. this pattern is found in the text, then the text is exchanged against the respective replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Specify for your filter a name. this name, you can choose to choose to distinguish only by the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the string chains in the column agreement and replaced it in accordance with the string set out of column design. the list is used in the shown sequence of the above-down.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Currently & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) because this is the default, the festival is used at the SSML issue.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pick-up in the festival configuration line is not set to 100º; SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2728">Here you see the proposition of limitations. in the first start of & ktts; it will be set automatically as a set of limitations filter. you can change the settings or other puncturing filter, but it will be unsealed.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the easiest way you can try out the number of speaking selection, which spokesman and ktts. switch the speaker selection, change some features and try out how to have a speaker, you will need more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with the board can start, since only the first movement can be processed, and not the whole word block which can take very long.</seg>
<seg id="2731">If you want to keep text orders on map orders or break, even if the voice synthesizer did not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal precrealization filter will automatically be set automatically when you can start kttsmgr. it cannot be removed only. change not in this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filter compare text with a regular expression of proposition and insert a tobacco mark (decimal code 8) to the propositional sign (tabulators are removed from the text removed from the text). notice that the default set of limitations will be maintains the charset filters.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Sbd filter will never be applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warning, news or the issue of Screen Readern.</seg>

<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user management of a number of system and desktopsettings on a single, integrated surface. & kcontrolcenter, can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to enable the management of TCP / IP network settings in the same way, like other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; creating a simple surface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed in & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knowworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It's important to understand that & knurworkconf; network hardware doesn't install. physical devices and their drivers have already been working and configured, thus & knetworkconf that enables the device at all, and enables the setting of the network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in Installing & Linux; with installed and set up. network devices will be added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded, if the network settings will be selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -index will be selected to automatically detect the platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not recognized, the hanging selection is offered. it is the platform from the list, the distribution of the distribution and the releaser, can be met permanently. by the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings are possible only in the system administration mode. before, all options can only be viewed, the changes can only be considered, the change is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can easily manage the password mode at the right end of the module. it is the input of the password required.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The semen network interfaces will be used to manage the system devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the Reiter network interfaces are carried out:</seg>

<seg id="2837">This will be recommended only experienced users. however, it's not difficult to compile & crisp; the following commands should afford.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about fundamental network technology will be discussed in the second, all of & knetworkconf; alterable configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can't replace an additional knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC can be connected to a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4), and 5 has never found great spreading. from IPv6, it is expected to pass over IPv6 as well. this description is concentrating on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that addresses IP address of a network interface. in foreign network, at & eg; workstation is the network administrator, that can be used as a valid IP address, or if available, can not be selected any IP address!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When replacing a private small (home) network value should be selected the IP address from a specifically designed for this purpose to avoid IP address to the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore it is possible to use any other use.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, you can access the Internet for such machines through setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">Smaller networks are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the network mask is set to 255.255.255.0, so all the calculators are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the standard route is required for the IP product line.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine. usually, the address is 127.0.0.1 is assigned to the so-called loopback interface that works as a closed circuit.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; this may happen on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; Spult the band back and reads the pretensioninformation of the band. identifies & kdat; the preset on the band will not be asked if the band is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Identifies & kdat; the templates, searches it according to the appropriate index on your disk. cannot be asked if the band index is new to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went straight, the symbol changes the band for band, to indicate that the band was bound. in the status strip a corresponding message appears. the volume of the belt can now be searched out through the entry of the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to design the band, the integration must be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; exists by a change of symbol for the band that the integration of the band was solved and shows an appropriate message in the status bar. the band can now be rejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A bandarten need to be formatted before you can be used for saving of data. this process does not need to be formatted before using the band from & kdat; it cannot be formatted before you use the band from & kdat; usually a formatting of the bandes ahead, DAT drives not yet to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After input of the band called and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all the data on the band go lost! after completion of the formation, the band will be automatically bound and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you drive the backup process, you need to make sure you need to make sure you want to make sure that you can happen on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Choose a file or a file in local file tree. only this file is secured or the file.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Markings a safety profile in the tree. only the files will be backed up in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Markings files in local file tree with one skins. only the so marked files and / or subfolder are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click the right button key to the local file tree and select in the sip menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog appears for backup. in this dialogue, you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears in the dialog. dialogue shows the progress of the backup process, including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Marking a file or a file in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or the file is checked.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the bandindexfile using the band content. this process solves all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a fuses profile with the straight marked files and default settings. you can use the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current occupational file where the safeguards are to be made. the list of the files will be updated automatically, according to the chosen working files.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all file, which are listed under securing files that are located on the same filesystem, which are located on the same filesystem, which can be used on the same file systems, you can apply separately under securing files. every entry is collected from tar independent of the other file systems.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Conduct a incurmental backup. to determine which files have been used since the last incurmental file, a snapshot file will be backed up since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that uses the changes of changes in the last incuringual backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files will be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons are & gt; lt; lt; lt; files was not completely implemented for the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can make the settings on the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. the following settings can take you:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path has to refer to the non-winding variant of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transferred & kdat; before the band is bound to the drive. in some drives this is necessary, before reading or writing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If this option is switched on, attempts to shut down and shut down on tape drives. possibly this setting does not work with all bandages.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the connection of the integration of & kdat; automatically discarded the band automatically. use this option not using floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched, attempts & kdat; not all drives support variable log sizes. whether this setting is active or not, you must be & kdat; in any case the block size for your band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a band formatted, writing it a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should just give a memory block on the band. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N byte) The band ID. the format of this character is invoice: seconds, whereby the host name is the full name of the system, which was formatted on the band. seconds is the number of seconds that have been formatted since the era.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to be used with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar -archives that can operate directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar -versions should work, as long as it is not invalid fuses.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kle; -viewer for system protocerolls. the program is available for unexperienced users, where you can also need information about your system. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users can access the fast access to any problems related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer doing in the background. the program is suitable for unexperienced users, which cannot know where you can get information about your system, or where the system can be deposited for the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users the fast access to the example of information about problems which perform on their server. & ksystemlog; thus tries to provide some enhanced functions, supported the protocol files modified programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 possesses & ksystemlog; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog-Servers and Samba format</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition and are discussed in the subsequent chapters of this hand.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, shows & ksystemlog; functions for the individual protocol of a protocol can be easily filtering and sort by means of the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manuscript.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol takes place, and it opens not instead of a small news window, so you don't want to have using system forerunner. the protocol files are usually taken in the folder / var / log, for the normal users usually have no authorization to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip for filming after a selected criterion or according to the specified character set. in the default setting, the selection box contains only displayed next to the filter, if in one of the columns the string set is contained in the filter search engine.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another record. the string set of the filter search results will be used in compliance with the setup of a process. if you have a process in the filter strip the names of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines sent to which of this process have been sent.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of stage errors will be displayed with a striking colour than protocol lines of stage. the colour display of protocol-lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you would like to see certain process (for example in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this may be useful for example, if you want to examine the issue of a certain command as for example to the Samba server. in this case you can use filter strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to activate all new lines in the context of the main window, to display all new add-off lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate windows. to open this function, use the entries in the window to open extra window and to manage. once you have selected a window, select the menu to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more recent information about the source of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also in the following file of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kle; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following so named) as & ksysv;. this section does a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init develops rapid to the standard for controlling the program, at the highly cycle of system in the & Linux; world. therefore because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time flexible is as the traditional BSD inputs.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going on stratially aspects (and others because I don't know about this: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not below / etc. this is therefore important because somebody could try out a machine at system V Init, without a new installation and reformatted. that's why you need to ensure that the old Init was removed there, if there was there any one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init is also distinguished by the BSD content that the configuration files in a subfolder from / etc will take place directly in / etc. this file is rc.sysinit and following further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole amount of scripts. generally, you need a script for any system service that you want to run on another round level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services would not include such things such as setserial, which is only once started. such calls may include rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie down under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there are not much using this file, even if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d when you want to do anything with the serial connection, what you want to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for various locations after the program init and starts the first, which he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see the following line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can design a look into the second column and probably reveal that the pre-set runlevel 3 is. if you wish to edit / etc / inittab by hand, then you can repair all this, then enter it once you start the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, you can probably look like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this file. instead, each entry is an link to one of the scripts in the init.d list.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init all system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would reads the httpd server. init reads the name, and if a K contains, will be called the script by the argument, will be called the script by the argument by the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people would like to create many purposes such as httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; can also be run. furthermore I could even have a user-lap level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another character unit is simple to say not to say trivial: draw an entry from the range of disable system services to one of the six runlevel to launch him on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You may also move the scripts between Runleveln move or position within a level by changing it. so the entry will be removed from its original runlevel (or his position), this is only going to withdraw an entry from the range of disable system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">NOTE: entries will be postponed when you need to copy these into a new range. in order to select only one new runlevel, you need to select copy from the menu and then in the target range, even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sort code number of a bit can be not calculated. in such a case you must work the concerns of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">NOTE: there is no possibility to restore entries to the paper bin. be so cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab -key to activate the various workranges (disable system services, runlevel 1 stop, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a choice of upper or below previous previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To shift one entry into another round level, move it with cut into the meantime (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired round level with Insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sort code or the name of a piece manually, press the entry button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog through reboot the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to refuse the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the risk of the data loss, all entries in the menu is a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have tested the standard Runlevelop experimented, and now is the machine-resistant to the machine. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read details in the manual page.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services will be launched in these distributions, but unfortunately not any standard. the authors of & ksysv is planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check whether all configuration files are required (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end no message if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, even if you use a version of version. if you can use another distribution, please send us information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the text adaptation of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have done changes, you have to save it. either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry Save in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple use. the main window is made of two boxes, user and user rating list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog User or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards will only be displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you don't want to use custom settings. if you can choose custom settings. other cards appear if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd as are installed in BSD.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card panel passwords appear if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd as are installed in BSD.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if you can be activated for at least a set-up file system (Quota) and initialized (recognizable on the file quotas / quota.group on the filesystem), and can be changed for each user parameters, whereby the registration positions each are in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for any file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the field system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The board map provides information on the group members of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs, you will find in the field of Primera Group. furthermore, users can be member in other groups by placing these in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to add that users in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or add a group, select adding from the menu users or group or click on the appropriate Add-button of the toolbar. editing or deleting of the selected users or the selected group will work analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can remove the LILO Bootmanager, remove the boot password, remove the time to add the standard operating system, list operating systems, change systems, change and more.</seg>
