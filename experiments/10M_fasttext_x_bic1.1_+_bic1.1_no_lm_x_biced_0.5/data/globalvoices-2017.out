although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would live for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is excep@@ tionally great .
like many of my generation I have grown to American movies , I have read American music , American authors and operated in his sport .
in fact , this country had a good pro@@ found impact on me that I was mainly due to a American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enzel Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who led to a terri@@ fic rep@@ orter who accompanied by the help of a oil @-@ magn@@ um who had his interest .
I was caught .
Free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was it as if the absolute Truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I was living in Arizona , I had only strengthened my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country , in whom I have ever lived , whose variety can always be that you can always be that you are , and it is easy to find an acceptance in a community of equ@@ ili@@ ate people .
I had even written a very low love letter through its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the stran@@ ger and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his entry is for me , as it goes with his Eng@@ ad@@ iness .
he never stops in his opinion behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he think , like a former colle@@ ague it ex@@ press@@ ly , and publicly declared that his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ Americ@@ er and Women .
nevertheless the people have re@@ acted to his testimony , and in vain for him .
the 13 million votes who won the Repub@@ lican elections , was the highest number formed by the party nom@@ in@@ ized candidate .
I was l@@ ingu@@ ished .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ est person ?
I could not kill Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers who I bring with people in Phoenix during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist , people from all over the world , a deep belie@@ ving man , with whom I could keep me about Islam and past ten@@ se .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps also voted the editor of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Sun@@ s &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is also reflected in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I lived in Sandy B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gling for life with the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son .
yet it fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and pri@@ de to me and my colleagues helped us to acc@@ ust@@ om@@ ed us to the complex@@ ity of the American life .
then Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kathr@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er has helped me much in my career .
these people and those by they short@@ ened values in deep@@ ened my love .
while Tr@@ ump on its way to nom@@ inate repub@@ lican Pre@@ sidential candidate , they sent to me a stop and the counter@@ part of its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pre@@ sidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the med@@ itation with the idea that people have voted for tr@@ ump , because they were either willing to see his rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , because they were willing to see these things almost the heart broke out .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to record the Tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as a La@@ wn .
people to ord@@ oned , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is super@@ fic@@ ially and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those that deal with a different kind and manner .
it shows the people that their concerns and fe@@ ars about the hec@@ tic changes in their con@@ greg@@ ations are not taken into account .
could it be that these vot@@ ers , of which most knows are , for tr@@ ump , because they wish to win control over a country that she dis@@ appointed .
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in that America ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who comm@@ ented the cru@@ el &apos;s decision to draw a man who looks at those with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) : as much as &quot; Re@@ j@@ ection of the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; Word Game from white in action on the wil@@ lows and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what it means how great Van Jones called exactly what America did so great .
millions people estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether my@@ th or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have , America is every welcome .
for this country chose the president , twice the son of a Ken@@ o , whose history is as he says , now@@ here else in the world .
however , with the selection Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of America this promise and says : hell comp@@ as@@ ible , religious freedom and the entire term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America , after 9 / 11 , the white man again is at the rud@@ der , tell them .
at all that I have to remember K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a fest@@ iv@@ ity for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , one place in your America ? &quot; said Mr. Khan .
the multitude answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; if Muslims were a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the quantity turned out .
&quot; have a space in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; sm@@ ell her and their voices were li@@ cked .
&quot; would anyone who did not like to enter a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a voice and a loud &quot; No &quot; !
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was correc@@ ted .
the land , for that his son did , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all people who like to look like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

that music that played at both locations , not only the lives of children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill colony , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but wor@@ lds away from the nearby pre@@ colonial Ru@@ ins and his world famous kitchen .
for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) now plays in the congregation : one of children and adults existing Symph@@ onie orchestra , which has found in their musical instruments a possibility to over@@ take it in poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the village of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church that is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs mis@@ use and the Ban@@ den Viol@@ ence .
however , that after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth as a rare hop@@ per .
the young band@@ members take their oblig@@ ations towards the music group , we@@ ep the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch break them through the dust of passion for their great passion .

music from Mül@@ l
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that lies practi@@ cally at the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ un@@ ción in Par@@ agu@@ ay capital - in instruments that are made from restored waste materials :
music with restored instruments , made up of local firm waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the Recy@@ cl@@ er under management of Fav@@ io Ch@@ á@@ vez began to trans@@ form parts of the waste in instruments .
instruments im@@ it@@ neys , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double bass@@ es , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trumpets , trombones and percussion , all from the gar@@ bage were produced .
the re@@ per@@ tory comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , of Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times Fav@@ io Ch@@ á@@ vez remin@@ ds a local ec@@ ologist and mus@@ te@@ aches of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to re@@ hear@@ sal and we had to contact the parents in the same place , the children k@@ icked no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them are not living together with their children .
this changed when Fav@@ io was something that he had ever seen before : a land@@ fall was given .
today there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) dra@@ ws the musical performance on :
the world generates approximately one billion tonnes of waste every year .
those who live with him and of him are the Trou@@ ble - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Par@@ agu@@ ay .
and here they walk him into a somewhat .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his in@@ spir@@ ational rock@@ ing play from gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
this Eastern African countries will show how technology and te@@ am@@ work together to fight illegal fishing industry .
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing .
this report , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , published an magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with global Vo@@ ices to the common use of In@@ hold .
in West Africa was known that this ship had already been operated in the liberal waters of illegal waters before the other coast had sought to Africa .
the East African countries were en@@ rolled in this way and hum@@ bled , a stat@@ es@@ cri@@ min@@ als of this kind to their c@@ ows .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ for@@ ts , Moz@@ ambi@@ que , and Sey@@ ch@@ elles mobil@@ ized rapidly against the ship . they refused to have one of their ports and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ama was surrounded by countries that you simply ref@@ use everything , &quot; remin@@ is@@ cent of Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fishing industry . he is part of a team that discovered the ship with a team .
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it did not succe@@ ed to catch there fish .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of these initiative , crosses the criminal practices and resources , FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal f@@ ish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagas@@ car , the six countries that followed the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal together and are facing each other , where it &apos;s about illegal fishing industry , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the Pe@@ w CH@@ ARI@@ TABLE Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers FISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regul@@ ated by definition : what is captured , is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to feel because of the illegal fishing industry is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
through the estimated dis@@ ability of the laws , of which particular hab@@ it@@ ats and species are being protected , the illegal fishing industry can sh@@ ades which have a del@@ ic@@ ate balance .
but while actions against the illegal fishing was passed through bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dles , and also through the worm de@@ vi@@ ate , with the information between individual countries , so the actions happen in real @-@ time , with per@@ secu@@ rely on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there may include the individual countries , for example , to susp@@ end licenses for susp@@ ect activities or details , not@@ ice@@ able during a port inspec@@ tion or see .
fish @-@ i per@@ sec@@ uted the activities of ships also very atten@@ tively , when they move on the open lake , by satellite data .
this enables the authorities to record ships which flows in b@@ anned areas . also , such susp@@ ected driving ro@@ uting - about such that suggest@@ s that a ship will go on other ships on other ships .
in the ideal case , such studies indicate whether the ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the way and may eventually , if they have a criminal case .
countries which are against illegal fishing , can be ref@@ use to the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships could not sell your charge , and that they even could be forced to numbers of pen@@ al@@ ties , as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant losses for the owner , meaning that the illegal fishing is not benef@@ ic@@ ial anymore .
and that &apos;s what we want to reach , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a mountain company that foc@@ uses on the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD of lost sales , which seem to lose the eight members of the network of H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fisher@@ men that enter into Eastern African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una f@@ ish@@ eries , which is responsible for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . including those of illegal fisher@@ men also .
in their intern@@ s include actions as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ ed licens@@ ing documents , stated by ph@@ as@@ ien@@ names , the fish protected species , and the fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; you are using the missing international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ rest@@ less organized control systems &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; formerly been a ship illeg@@ itim@@ ate and a country could not say &apos; You will not go to my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ales are trying to complete FISH @-@ i .
so , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 investig@@ ations of susp@@ ects .
it has dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ted networks , which had f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it compet@@ ent ships and found .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to the fight of crimes , FISH @-@ i can provide information about illegal fishing , over large distances and preserved .
&quot; &quot; some of our investig@@ ations lead us quite well into networks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system to help FISH diagnostic , susp@@ ects ships even more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which has always been developed , hel@@ ping us also arrange the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ men use very ra@@ ff@@ ed techniques to destroy their activities and their position , &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Ch@@ ef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , a N@@ RO which also offers technical data with f@@ ish@@ eries and FISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships on the example of automatic identification systems , where they can no longer be used by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information each other . there should be FISH @-@ i hel@@ ping to find a dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating ships with greater precision .
one model program
however , FISH @-@ i &apos;s Team afri@@ can nations actually influence on the und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes it .
recently , Sky@@ Truth together with Google and the marine protection organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana will open the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed with the position of each single @-@ fol@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get a better picture of it to get a better picture of it , who does that do - this makes it simple sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to use and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; PE@@ W CH@@ ARI@@ TABLE Tru@@ sts has a similar project , with which a global system per@@ secution of ships .
there are evidence that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only re@@ sign@@ posts , but they are also scre@@ ened .
ships that previously no license explo@@ ited and hardly to count with consequences , knowing that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in FISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in F@@ ish@@ eries , since then fishing boats are more licenses .
after FISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 had taken up , the inspec@@ tors found there on board bases , and their use is prohib@@ ited .
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries will notice this successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa annually dis@@ appear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries joined the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight the illegal fishing industry , after exactly the same model such as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With Safety , the goal is to create more such initi@@ atives and structures also in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member land shows its first big victory : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was used without licence , and have been used to be b@@ anned in the meantime .
the ship was still b@@ anned in b@@ anned waters that are reserved for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a strong sign that they go towards illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for FISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time , the fact that a sol@@ ch special , collab@@ orative work to protect the oc@@ eans is actually working in the whole world . Emma Bry@@ ce is free lance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .

the street movement in Venezuela appear only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstr@@ ations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for the President of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

the debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the region of Bar@@ inas , in the village of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the central north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta .

Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ izes in its latest articles in the context of government surface as follows :
within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , the highest proportion of inflation and medicine has been estimated to include the referendum for many as the only way to give country the chance to res@@ em@@ ulate its institu@@ tional structures and to include a new government alliance .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father , a secret prison in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine town of Cordoba .
in the context of adult men , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the frame of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba towards his father .
the trial comm@@ enced on 24 August 2016 , a crime that were committed during the Argentine military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not see his life .
starting with the offices , the same name as his father bear to the brut@@ al military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he took enough .
he felt the family home for 34 years .
in the situation at the time I think that was fine .
I felt like a secret sequence .
in the age of 15 , you do not know that man will man@@ ipul@@ ates from his father .
I could not know that my father had a th@@ ief , fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Service department 141 , in prison La Per@@ la .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had seen the extent of the world &apos;s extent that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a par@@ ent about his child and how this child has chosen one way of re@@ dem@@ ption .
from the Sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me up to the military base , I often went into the Sports hall . I got myself with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts took me .
all known him &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ and photo , and asked me to identify my bo@@ y@@ friend to identify my bo@@ y@@ friend .
he said :
you are a he@@ d@@ hole , you have rounded you with an ER@@ P around the world .
Pass only that they don &apos;t have to leave you for one day , and I have to save you .
the ER@@ P ab@@ bre@@ viation ER@@ P stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ ebl@@ o , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of revolutionary workers Argent@@ ini@@ ens .
therefore he offered me to go back to the Sports hall . some days later he took me with the work on the military base .
he told me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and I was in the situation I was fine . for so my Father had taken me .
on the military base point I had to destroy Pap@@ ers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University ends , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ anda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ da dr@@ illed the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he made me to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he commanded me to asc@@ end myself . he led me to a Bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - simply all possible .
everything was st@@ olen .
he gave me a little house in a blank@@ et , and commanded me to carry it to car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the st@@ olen objects were taken , and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he interpre@@ ted on an open space and said :
the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
I saw in and saw a couch for tort@@ ured on the human being .
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ springs .
later I found out that they for@@ tified an end of a cable . the other end was fixed at the body of the person , which was right there .
they rarely rarely spend a person with hand straps at the bed , shot up with water and hunting a charge of 220 Volt into the gen@@ italia .

the st@@ ank there was wrong ... such as a dir@@ ty win@@ del .
years later , as my father stood under house arrest , the same sm@@ ell came from his room .
I recognized the sm@@ ell once again and I was clear that the sm@@ ell of a body in need is .
I was never forgotten this sm@@ ell .
and I asked me : how is it possible to do a man can do with another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed .
when my Father took me for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners with hand tor@@ ments and eyel@@ ids were carried out .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also indicted only in the process ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses that bare people with the face down , all were at hands and feet .
near the entrance of the cr@@ acking people still had peace on the matt@@ resses .
when my father saw that I saw at the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ilt thou so , Ass@@ ay ? &quot;
I enco@@ unters &quot; Why have you brought me else ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that , because my father counted at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were called the offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck there a man and killed him .
( according to survi@@ v@@ ors of survi@@ v@@ ors , the civ@@ il@@ ization Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina was sentenced to death in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the head of the mem@@ orial La Per@@ la , through the former fol@@ ter@@ ets .
the way , which you come here to come here is also the way , on which they led here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this track and tort@@ ured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were named as part of the process of de@@ hum@@ ane number .
when she survived the torture , prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the top came to be moved .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the purpose of man and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all possible st@@ olen things with home .
at that time , in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they knew it was .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war@@ fare is a bay@@ onet or perhaps a military insignia that man fought against him to fight against him .

but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not a lack of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is the@@ ft .
I always asked me how my father , the leader of security forces , at this Vand@@ alism could do .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was army officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al it all in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do .
once he called me a crime and I said : and you , that you joined the street in the street ?
you are no crime ?
he re@@ acted before W@@ ut , he sm@@ ote me , and cried , saying ,
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
do we need any other one !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory to him .
when I said in the process , I showed a picture of that , on which I made a jacket and a roll @-@ like wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he brought clothing to her home .
then , he accused me of defence , a fellow cont@@ ested at this crime . I said , no problem , they may take me to load what they wanted .
I was something there , to speak .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the pl@@ ague is the last ab@@ eu@@ rial ac@@ ute &apos;
now , where I am older I find re@@ ue .
I have children . if you only have children , one recognize the value of a life .
you have developed further and det@@ ect that it is wrong to kill .
I even walked so far to say :
so , you have executed a rep@@ airs during the dictatorship , but what the bodies are dis@@ appe@@ aring ?
why children are kid@@ n@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost as a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always turned back the question : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ?
you could have been able to bring it to the prison .
I reck@@ on , it was simply decided to kill these people . but what they dis@@ appear to van@@ ish ?
in those men , these people do not have families who could have been handed over to her remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the suffer@@ ings is the last ab@@ ul@@ ent act which can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to elim@@ inate the remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and somewhere . no idea where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
just um it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even with the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 cri@@ min@@ als , among them my Father .
the thought to show my father , when he was standing under house arrest .
I made him conclusion because of all the cru@@ el skills , I had to experience s@@ log@@ an because of all the cru@@ el .
then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed me . &quot;
I felt him comp@@ as@@ sion and asked me when the entire Patri@@ otic Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian fe@@ el@@ ings &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended , actually was good .
then , cr@@ ying me ,
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
you have a terri@@ ble crime , and you have forced to cast me as a child .
he only said &quot; Oh , then po@@ inting me . &quot;
exactly what I did .
in 2010 I ref@@ unded the first display .
I finally realized that he was a break@@ ers .
nobody can th@@ rowing to me that I am vo@@ re@@ ingen@@ ommen . I finally have told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 at the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 416 counts : among them severe , un@@ law@@ ful of liber@@ ty in 158 cases , torture in 98 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of one under 10 years of child .

a translation errors makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terri@@ fic car drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors on a center in Kyoto , one can pro@@ long@@ ed his guide .
the photo was spread in social media .
arrangement of the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers received a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long@@ ed his leadership , in the last month witnesses of a very special mis@@ sil@@ enced translation .
on a sign , the Japanese word ( E@@ co@@ rei@@ un@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means accid@@ ent@@ ally - maybe even with a back@@ wards and # 8@@ 212 ; as the &quot; aw@@ esome motor@@ cycl@@ ist &quot; was translated .
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September at electronic ads in the input and in the building itself .
arrangement of the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided into social media in social media .
the error was a trans@@ lat@@ ors of Julian Hol@@ mes , a population of Ky@@ otos with a population of Ky@@ iv . it was also to attention to the local time .
the liberal daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n was written in Kyoto .
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this shows that no one has read the translation .
this is an ad@@ her@@ ent for older people and in an international city as the Kyoto un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; fur@@ ther@@ able car driver &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate designation &quot; Elder Council &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture acc@@ ru@@ ed for the translation errors that the error was already in the text that they had been tested by the trans@@ lat@@ ors and that translation was not tested on their stra@@ ight@@ ness before it was published .
a b@@ logger reported as follows the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if older people felt right through in@@ adequate correction ( translation ) , the police said .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat in detail with the phenom@@ enon of the &quot; aw@@ esome &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fur@@ cht@@ able &quot; was used as an appropriate description of older car drivers . according to the police , the share of older car drivers who are devast@@ ated nation@@ wide in accid@@ ents , but are very reason to wor@@ ry .
in the Kyoto f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , a total of 19.@@ 460 causes of sen@@ iors were caused by sen@@ iors . this represents a proportion of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the senior citizens voted 1.@@ 803 from a total of 11,@@ 850 .
thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accid@@ ents fell from the same period , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused accid@@ ents in the same period .
the nam@@ ing was not called Rep@@ orter released on Yah@@ oo published version of the article Comments to Light , who show how to make the advantages some Japanese ten@@ ds against older autograph@@ s :
the article on Yah@@ oo about the translation errors got the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terri@@ fic car driver &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; If the translation is not true , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; I cannot find that this is a true translation error . &quot;
there are not a few other comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so spread throughout Asia
transmission error are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bi@@ z@@ arre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of transl@@ ator are varied .
to transl@@ ate two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output of the output and active language skills to trans@@ mit it into the target language .
the latter requires the active behavior of the target language - something that is in the mat@@ ters of the case . generally , the trans@@ gression is that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the native language - par@@ l@@ ingu@@ istic .
in this case , a French native speakers for example , transl@@ ating from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies emplo@@ y any staff with English as the mother tongue , which might have translations into English . this may be missing of understanding , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers , learn Japanese language .
some companies that have not have no foreign staff , don &apos;t want to manufacture fir@@ men@@ intern@@ ally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is made as the best one , as good or bad his language skills are really good .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
mach@@ ining translations are also widespread - often with fun results .
the phr@@ ases and r@@ ass@@ le@@ es sets that origin@@ ates by Machine Transl@@ ations , show that this technology can do not have any human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages very particularly .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including those who are often used to decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or pockets , only for sty@@ list@@ ic reasons - not to read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r User Joseph Br@@ ent .
the translation errors may be acceptable , or at least harm@@ less . but of great companies or from the government to ensure higher standards , you can expect more carefully translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a seri@@ ously ill source for their translations .
Venezuela : prot@@ ests and ens@@ ity measures on the Internet and television
the main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to PR@@ EN@@ SA y Soc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday , the 7th of April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users decided that they have no access to the online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later other user wrote that the Internet access is V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV be also accessible .
other online stations delivered to the prot@@ ests in Carac@@ as , organised by op@@ positions groups involved in the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s government .
the protest started in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ band@@ ed the parliament and the Supreme Court transferred to the executive court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ em@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection was called , and recommended the Us@@ ers , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN .
it seems that the sites can be imprisoned again in the Venezu@@ el@@ an Provi@@ der .
this is from the page by @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ern with Internet access , especially in periods of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been in the reporting on prot@@ ests since 2014 . then , the Commission for telec@@ omm@@ unications offer them with money pen@@ sions and make contact , when they continue to report this as &quot; Call to Viol@@ ence &quot; ans@@ ah .
I signed up with cable TV and informative national TV channels at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
aston@@ ishing that that is still favorable , than two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ F@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is un@@ accessible by a re@@ pl@@ ement of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also includes two more online transm@@ itters . this also includes website , where the National Assembly transfers their sessions .
earlier research @-@ research institute of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local network oper@@ ators have to use DNA . it is aimed at answer through the DNS server of a certain dom@@ ains .
if a website is block@@ ed through the DNA , answers the server is faul@@ ty or ref@@ using the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third closed channel , the transfer on Thursday , April 6th , was set when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ eram@@ an El@@ vis Flo@@ res which was transferred to the prot@@ ests in Carac@@ as .
Flo@@ res was be@@ aten , while he was imprisoned in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV returned to the show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regul@@ ated the Internet connection : thus the Ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ern is continuing to be more accurate over the current events in the country .
in Par@@ agu@@ ay , many girls will become of s@@ la@@ inside to get a training
Tina Alvar@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
today Tina was fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts testimony of other Cri@@ mes who were exactly like the victims of mis@@ use and dis@@ cri@@ mination .

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report of short , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying c@@ ows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Alvar@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they were not together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university , she returned once again into the house and heard , as the owner of the house full of pri@@ de talked about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
die , who has become something , said , &quot; she said .
but Tina Alvar@@ eng@@ a has never been treated as a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas in Par@@ agu@@ ay , the more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school to school .
the shop is quite simple : a great family with little money over her under@@ age @-@ old son or her under@@ age daughter is a different , rich family . in the exchange , the child receives the child meal , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned , however , the children must not be paid for the count@@ less days of house , who can never be paid and victims of ab@@ use and ab@@ use systems - and all that can &apos;t lift up in the context of a contract .
this as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is described in Par@@ agu@@ ay , due to its participation and acceptance through major parts of society and despite many compl@@ aints affected by human rights organisations .
after completion of their studies , Alvar@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that f@@ ights for the rights of the boys and girls .
in particular , she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected testim@@ on@@ ies , resear@@ ched , and repeat@@ edly .
she tried to call things on behalf of name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated with the cri@@ mp@@ ity , guaranteed to be still silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double activity , explains Alvar@@ eng@@ a .
there is one of the family that they improve their daughter in the faith that they improve their voc@@ ational training in society , and &quot; something from &quot; can be translated into a different family .
on the other hand , the family stands on the other hand , and whose explo@@ itation is just@@ ified by faith that they would give someone to give someone else , who would not be hun@@ gry , and perhaps would be hun@@ gry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
when the girls is har@@ ass@@ ed , his family will see only many years later .
sometimes they never know them .
in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenom@@ enon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a vision .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , the body showed heavy laden stro@@ kes . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of former Mil@@ ás Ferreira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as civil servant at the population of the population .
Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ ería , a small village with just 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ un@@ ción .
at the end of January 2016 , Ferreira stroke Ferreira as long as a stick on Mar@@ ín , until they suffered f@@ atal inju@@ ries .
this should be the last confirmation in the life of young girls .
a few days later , the media reported on the incid@@ ent .
they st@@ ressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNI@@ CEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of s@@ la@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen people came to protest in protest together and required that there is no further Carolina in Par@@ agu@@ ay in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
the name of the girls and photos were widespread in the social media .
in Par@@ agu@@ ay , more c@@ ows are registered as children , mo@@ urn@@ ed Tina Alvar@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier , un@@ pun@@ ished the rights of children too .
without an official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neigh@@ bo@@ urs of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society demanded a gener@@ ous investigation .
they want that Tom@@ ás Ferreira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the murder of the girl .
if the case fall before the court could be the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín , until the first time in the history of Par@@ agu@@ ay , a fall of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is a fall of judgment .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as workers , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Alvar@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the color , in whom her father worked , bank@@ ru@@ pt@@ cy , and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all works and began to sell money on the street or on the market sweet to earn money .
but they went all to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital of As@@ un@@ ción .
in the house of their emplo@@ yer , Alvar@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
during this time , they had to share the time that her still stayed at the learning .
it got every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their emplo@@ yer .
Fri@@ days for example , it clean@@ ed the fridge , used the living room , polished furniture and des@@ ires .
when the school was at the end , she went back home again and had time to learning .
the more time they had done with the learning , the more leisure had it .
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their emplo@@ yer .
Alvar@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to be hun@@ gry , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to collect more books from the house of the house under the fridge , &quot; remin@@ is@@ cent of them . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the household of Liber@@ al , a former military and symp@@ ath@@ ist of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some even@@ ings of the Ho@@ er@@ r Alvar@@ eng@@ a , next to him and head of opposition such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ ebl@@ o &quot; on some even@@ ings .
in this process he tried to con@@ vin@@ ce them to give the reports of the official media about the regime of the dictatorship .
he held her for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; the Ho@@ er@@ r had found someone who spoke to him while he spoke over policy , &quot; says it .
&quot; you don &apos;t have to visit my family , because they were the mind that I would come again &quot; bad hab@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Alvar@@ eng@@ a who belongs to the indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ ani who would speak to her mother tongue of Guar@@ ani .
their Lord fe@@ ared that they had done the education that she had allowed to lose it , explains them .
she was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid for them with their hard work .
also in the school there was Alvar@@ eng@@ a dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken are mo@@ bb@@ ing and the arch@@ ic@@ ans of which cri@@ ad@@ itas are subject to school .
because the other children are parents , they know immediately that any man has no parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could invite you to my house . I didn &apos;t have a friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships produce , I felt very clearly that I belonged to any group .
the ins@@ ul@@ sion was the worst of all , &quot; Alvar@@ eng@@ a .
the Company reduced the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group , where they work spaces for cleaning staff and nurs@@ ery products in Par@@ agu@@ ay .

in the third comment posted by &quot; a girl from the inner city that wants to work . &quot;
then the author of the ad had once again one :

legisl@@ ative draft of soci@@ ability to register social media , to register at the government
image from Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
publ@@ ishes under the Public domain CC@@ 0 .
six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary report has recently submitted a bill to &quot; the regul@@ atory in terms of use and usage of social networks . &quot;
if it is accepted by Parliament , users have to register social media in Egypt in Egypt , to register social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law the law would then be established , which is to use civil society and citizens to share permission to share social media .
within six months with the assum@@ ption of the law , users would have to register users with their proper names and staff numbers to register social networks .
if it is fo@@ amed to do this , the pun@@ ishment of up to six months were det@@ ained or a fine of fine .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ils and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt instruc@@ tors , defined social media as &quot; any &quot; any application that goes on the Internet and used to communic@@ ate with others by voice , video print and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear as the law is pres@@ cri@@ bed if it is assumed that the draft should not be addressed to the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ler , parliamentary report and funding of the legisl@@ ative situation , acqu@@ ain@@ t@@ led the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and user from the telec@@ omm@@ unications Ministry of usage and a password to come across the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;

I doubt about the technical capacities and the understanding of the neither authority in Egypt concerning D@@ ingen , which have to do with technology .
according to my opinion , it is so that the same physical public and private premises can also be done online now .
if I feed them , then it means that they apply a powerful surveillance system to apply citizens , or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of men and also to execute a ju@@ di@@ ment process .
this is techn@@ ically very realistic but in Egypt is all possible .

why is this specific type of Leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Per@@ sian Leopard is the only two remaining pre@@ payment in the Kur@@ dish ec@@ os@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the thought of the ec@@ os@@ ystem is also present that a big noise is present .

early March 2017 , documented in Japan &apos;s daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the past six years , to re@@ build the life of the three @-@ fold cat@@ astrophe , which had been affected by the &quot; Three @-@ fold cat@@ astrophe , which had caused the cat@@ astrophe in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima in March 2011 .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its seat in Sen@@ da@@ i , which lies in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a perfect pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , which had to see the earthquake and the t@@ ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ ing sites Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had dis@@ appear to dis@@ appear from the map .
yet the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima survived a atom@@ ic accident , only 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows a local view which has been achieved after six years later to re@@ build the life of local communities .
the detailed report of the newspaper comprises both the official statistics of the Japanese re@@ construc@@ tor as well as the survey results of the affected itself .
the housing location in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare houses ( bear@@ ers of Ar@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to draw Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of planned spare houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas at Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima runs 70 percent .
even though six years after the cat@@ astrophe , there are still six years after cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by j@@ uris@@ diction ( called San Francisco , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) for the final spare houses .
after the three @-@ fold cat@@ astrophe , almost 80 000 people saw to live in containers .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such actions .
nearly 40 percent of the Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima still live in not@@ ation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are still involved in not@@ ice@@ ably in emergency cases . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ates that were hau@@ led after the disaster zone , were converted into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ rate , the number is at 34 percent .
the state of work and daily life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by the disaster that will re@@ opened their doors until December 2016 , which is almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been operating in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima only 30 percent of the fishing ports operate in their work .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ ic accident , have moved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land in @-@ ob@@ es@@ ity .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was restored 93 percent of agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of the farmers in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
it is un@@ likely that the only one epis@@ ode of nuclear power is , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed the ar@@ able land of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima in the &quot; nu@@ cle@@ ars &apos; zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered well , but also the Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima remains stri@@ cken back here .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate rose again to 90 percent in the same stand as before the evil . Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , however , can only be 75 percent below .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reported that in the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants of the coastal area , there are more difficult to earn their hab@@ itat .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total figure , the newspaper conducted numerous surve@@ ys under the native population and under ev@@ acu@@ ate . she asked them over the state of reconstruction and even as their Emp@@ lo@@ om has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey through to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awar@@ eness among the native population in experience .
the survey was that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local population , measures taken up to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough in terms of dis@@ ast@@ ers prevention .
how to those who stands out of f@@ ush@@ ima pre@@ f@@ ecture in f@@ ush@@ ima pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ima from Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima had not only had the mighty earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima was also witness of the worst , cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ phen@@ ols , atom@@ ic accid@@ ents , had to experience the Japan .
nearly 63 000 people from Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima were moved to almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people back to Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , in permanent spare houses .
after the date of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants live in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astroph@@ es , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ates , which still remains in containers for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima embar@@ go with massive construction projects . this is a construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games which will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week in the intensive course : last Friday , a police officer held a police against the head in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nation@@ wide , millions of protest@@ ers participated in a protest against as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
Mat@@ eus Ferreira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has been a cran@@ ial brain trau@@ ma and several cargo c@@ tures .
doctors operate him on Saturday and got him into an artificial coma .
his state is considered to be critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread quickly in Brazil by a few days .
on the pictures the face of the police be@@ am@@ ten , which is identified with a strike . the man was identified as Augusto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incid@@ ent , the military police was known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the pre@@ cip@@ ation of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggest@@ s in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia and his impact on the face of Stud@@ ents Mat@@ eus Ferreira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer would test a demonstration of a police raid at a demonstration station , would be able to see his face six months in television and the entire repres@@ sion would be just@@ ified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ur@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activ@@ ists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , which is attacked , as Mat@@ eus down of the police attacked and several san@@ itary shortly there@@ after .

in the bottom , the clip can be seen from the attack on Mat@@ eus down the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of Brazil , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to stay in order to stay in the hospital , where he lies in the hospital at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia .

Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political power : here the activ@@ ist of a Wh@@ ats@@ app Group has been killed , because he has attacked the very sad school of Mat@@ eus Ferreira da Silva , who has attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Ferreira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officers , who has be@@ aten him with a strike in his face .

Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , during the last Friday of the brut@@ al police sent@@ ences against demonstr@@ ators .
polic@@ emen trained as a prot@@ ests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had erected a stage for speakers , rubber fin , and te@@ ard@@ as .
the Flav@@ io Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , Brazilian media prot@@ ests destroyed the focus on another , un@@ expected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window washer .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported on a broken glass windows to design their cover pages .
in contrast , O Glo@@ bo I prefer a title story with a reduced bus .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window at over the prot@@ ests of thousands that serve as defense of a special thing .
this must be recogni@@ z@@ able if you stri@@ ve stri@@ ve against any type of damage .
the term &quot; Vand@@ alism &quot; is also receiving a ab@@ sur@@ de , distinc@@ tive significance and the typical violence in military police are destroyed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police . &quot;
the villages of Cuba &apos;s un@@ du@@ t forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Álvar@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all the doors of Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ equ@@ e , is commonly known as a Central - on Spanish sugar mill - that there is no not@@ able sugar harvest .
it is two years ago when the activities were l@@ ayed .
after reaching the sugar cane industry in the region silent , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to be found .
some changes the work .
others re@@ signs and end@@ ul@@ led daily to factories that are still m@@ unded .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dat veter@@ an , who reads every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis is smo@@ oth@@ ly rough its sleep .
he heard that it has been in the east of the sugar cane factories , which have been in operation after a long @-@ active time , because they were preserved .
this was something that he is not expected .
N@@ ene remin@@ ds us exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resist@@ s the pl@@ agues , the case of soci@@ alism , the low market price , in@@ efficiency , cru@@ cial administration , and climate change .
in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
the message would have been some decades ago , a motif for wor@@ ry for the country , but the poor yiel@@ ds are already no re@@ vers@@ at@@ ility anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an cane industry switched off ?
the old train st@@ allion of the church saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was a cost @-@ economic necess@@ ity : the 155 sugar cane factories were techn@@ ically man@@ ages , and hardly competitive they were in@@ trac@@ eable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factory , the annual production rate was 4 million tons .
they just left the factories that can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the mot@@ ifs , which led to these measures were the small productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the fe@@ ather@@ ing rise in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased before approximately one decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 review of the &quot; Agri@@ cultural spec@@ torate &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the United Nations and Nutrition organisation of the United Nations .
when the current production reached the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar increase of roughly 85 million dollars for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; the present day is going to go through security in history , &quot; that were the first words of Cub@@ an president Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ and@@ ero .
from there , the process of re@@ struc@@ turing in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the bre@@ ast@@ feeding of 98 sugar cane covers , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same was in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repeated most , &quot; fr@@ aud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are not one of them : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to obtain the place , they created a full time working group .
before the first construction year , the first letters began to come .
this is the official documents , which only concerns about the parts , which would be removed , the address and the date distingu@@ ished .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the ministers could be appro@@ ve any auth@@ oriz@@ ation .
from there , the responsibility was passed and the letters were more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of the factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for that even in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in a stand@@ still in the factory , with whose construction he helped .
each piece , which he removed , dis@@ man@@ t@@ led one of his 31 labour years .
the best developed industrial area designed by Cuba and the most important workers of workers was removed .
in many cases there were no altern@@ atives to work and services that were generated in the municip@@ alities in which they were established .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former chairman of the Pres@@ ent People , when he guaranteed , that for the regions , whose factories were no longer in operation since five years .
the price of the population for closure of the sugar cane factories
in 2004 , the sugar cane was extrac@@ ted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always to better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory lock , or better , when they started to comfort it , they heard also on the road to asph@@ alted , it also had other establ@@ ish@@ ments .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , had to search N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories .
they have been delivered to spare parts .
once again , many young people left the region at once again .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not used for the power supply of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are im@@ posing .
in the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

the workshop achie@@ ves that the young participating in soci@@ etal topics such as cultural identity , language , med@@ itation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever they may also found in mind .
these questions are in@@ spiration for songs and videos , where the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations headquarters in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organ@@ ise a similar workshop with the trunk of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Ne@@ bras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Y@@ oo in the region of the tribe of Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , is part of the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of te@@ ars , &quot; which almost two do@@ zen were mostly indi@@ genous young women have disappeared or murdered .

that is the day when you &apos;ll kill our Schre@@ i

almost any restaurant plastic courts can be seen in Japan .
in order to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu list , are located close to the entrance of sho@@ ku@@ hin , &quot; &quot; Plast@@ ics &quot; ( &quot; ) of everybody food , which is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry , dedicated to the manufacture of this plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes , who documented the German film@@ maker Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a 20 years ago .
for most Japanese are these plastic dishes so that they cannot stand more . a new trend , however , is turned into a show@@ case for mobile and other g@@ ad@@ gets today .
the b@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published the b@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual Twist of sho@@ ku@@ hin .
now in special cases : new with plastic dishes , decorative tapes , as they are displayed in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have turned to kit@@ ten collec@@ ting objects , as in this case , cooling and cooling :
here are a few Sho@@ e fri@@ dges for a new exhibition at Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of the essence is increasingly w@@ ished .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular trip with se@@ afood ) is turned into a mobile phone support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found as a cell@@ phone support .
we also made this part to the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here &apos;s a apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like a apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing pl@@ ough into the county .
some mobile phone support and mobile designer allow you to produce your own art works . in this case ik@@ ura or salmon s@@ win@@ dled , a popular to@@ opping , served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their dou@@ b@@ ts :
there is someone who would say to me : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can kid@@ n@@ apped my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think , I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appet@@ ite form to surprise colleagues or family members .

in reports and foreign media about the inf@@ am@@ ous &quot; fight against thre@@ ats &quot; in Mexico , the missed and killed regularly only in statistics . this sp@@ ies however does not affect the extent of the human trag@@ edy that fight against this battle .
the reporting on Dro@@ gen@@ bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ell , ren@@ dered the stories of the vic@@ tim of conflict in the background .
on the day after a violent incid@@ ent , someone hardly any someone on the mo@@ urn@@ ing or to the churches that have learned to live with pain .
there are behind any dead , behind every bone found in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves that are twenty @-@ less parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their w@@ ounds might be never he@@ al .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co will learn the digital project &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( in German : &quot; with the drug @-@ trade live &quot; ) , giving the voice of a voice and stories of people who told the fight between the pro@@ secution and cart@@ ons .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
a organized crime us not allow us to fear our life .
the effects are much pro@@ found .
for example , if you close , because they are threatened by drug tra@@ ilers and whole municip@@ alities have to travel many kilometers to buy something like milk as milk .
the pain of Vic@@ tims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear of fear , &quot; ) tell this stories .
a main character is Guad@@ alu@@ pe , a father , who is looking for every weekend of secret gra@@ ves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Rod@@ r@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father , their four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of their nephew .
Pri@@ ests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task that we have made us to go and after the gra@@ ves , according to people who loved us to seek out . &quot;
Guad@@ alu@@ pe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
he left the house on 13 October .
on October 15th , he was back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now with three children who need a training .
there is even my mother , who also is with me here .
at the moment it has no income .
you will not understand the insurance of my Father , but who gets not paid out , because those who require a d@@ ying .
where should we get it ? &quot;
the ed@@ itors of &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are going to be afraid . we must show the international community , the conflict and the State .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from the stories .
KY@@ HB , a reading of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this contribution from tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Europe .
their contribution remin@@ ds us that you should never consider that violence should never consider as normal , in which form it occurs :
disease and sens@@ ation journ@@ alism I have now know for some years .
I come on a newspaper cutting every day and see the front page with pictures , which actually can only come from a text@@ book for cri@@ min@@ ology or experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only one who is rep@@ aired or sad . it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be valid or consider it as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old co@@ usin believes that he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people songs on the &quot; ly@@ re &quot; of the offen@@ ders , when they go through the streets .
for me , when they were those who hate those who have lost none , and those who have fear , that it happens something like them .
I see our weak@@ ness , if stories about naked figures in a statistics .
the crime of people is un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students are just@@ ified in neighbour@@ ing countries that they were up . &quot;
I think they try to say they don &apos;t stay from such a trag@@ e@@ dies when they don &apos;t touch and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of thre@@ ats in the main city : like a family with thre@@ ats , as it describes as armed crime month for month money from their business , until they were not only destroyed the shop , but also their family had torn apart .
you think about everything you lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain gets lost over it , the mo@@ urn@@ ing remains high when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
we have removed each other , the better .
they shut down their report by the words :
we want to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they should lead you or to kill you .
I asked me in these terri@@ ble days , if I would solve my deep@@ est fe@@ el@@ ings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to live . I have to learn how to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence .
in the introduction he asked questions on how : who takes care of the child of a missed wife and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ?
how is it in a settlement on the out@@ skirts of the most dangerous city of Mexican ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents can take care of them .
Bry@@ an is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells that he had to kill himself , how to make a egg , potatoes and makes &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine fol@@ ds on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and learn to live therefore to live .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared .
but that was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the blo@@ ody per@@ ch of his father saw , who had been shot by armed men from an early car .
when Bry@@ an was born when Bry@@ an saw the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez as follows :
Bry@@ an was born in 2006 when violence was mixed with the organized crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world by the number of murder for public security and the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secution found 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this transl@@ ates to 8.5 Mor@@ als per day .
these are just some of hundreds of stories that organised the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories living in view of the new head@@ lines . this project remin@@ ds us of those that we cannot forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; launched the data of journ@@ alism project Nar@@ cod@@ ata in 2015 , whose purpose is to include the complex information behind the drug market which has led the country in the past four decades , in under@@ way manner .
if a figure is worth a thousand in@@ true words
&quot; sharing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he left , include pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment where it is about to raise a rum@@ our or a counter@@ feit det@@ ect .
but how is the years after something that appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , incl@@ ined to stand further .
let us take this photo of a terri@@ ble accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
since its first publication , it has been used to be used , trag@@ e@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong copy of picture and event - &quot; false page &quot; or &quot; wrong text &quot; in the termin@@ ology of global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - does not den@@ ess the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but there will be any questions about our desire to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank wag@@ ons passed the place S@@ ange to the East of the DR Congo , typ@@ ed and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people living .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second biggest country has been neg@@ lec@@ ted and devast@@ ated thereby . the streets in the region have become extremely dangerous paths with impact holes that were difficult to travel .
load @-@ wise fell vic@@ tim to the gas station .
there was described a fire ball , the do@@ zens of buildings , including a cin@@ em@@ as nearby , which was full of people who looked for the soccer world championship .
houses burnt in the streets and scattered abroad in the streets .
many people were burned to misch@@ ief .
one picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , January 12th 201@@ 5.@@ Multi photos of the curtains are the cru@@ cial scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of short@@ ened body that are rounded up on the ground during persons .
but here the story is not their end .
over the years the same picture has been made several times on social media , b@@ logs and other platforms , but could not be attributed to the trag@@ e@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar .
on January 3 , 2015 , figh@@ ters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ le@@ genic Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
Aug@@ ers reported dra@@ st@@ ically of atro@@ cities where they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down in streets and pra@@ yers .
there were reports where 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ claimed .
the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count Lei@@ chen , &quot; said one resident to Human Rights Watch .
many were z@@ im@@ ated , shot or burned .
only from satellite images could be represented .
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflic@@ ts between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and an attempt by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here is the picture of the DR Congo again , as a result of evidence for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris , two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , in fact , this is the use of presentation of the DR Congo , only one in a series of mis@@ align@@ ment ; Africa Check has issued assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass destruction .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arg@@ uments .
the image of S@@ ange also occurred in conjunction with the dead@@ ly per@@ secution of the Muslim Br@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who could flee , r@@ ape and some dead , some through burning .
while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported post@@ s like the following to that these descriptions were related with photos from the DR Congo :
this image is derived from an sau@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which was involved in 2012 , the president My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an ear@@ ed , mon@@ ks and polit@@ icians have been involved in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo in order to be illustrated by this information .
the original contribution , which was access@@ ed on April 26 , 2017 , can be called here .
other Nachricht@@ ent@@ ities , the AF@@ P as their source called , had also canc@@ eled Th@@ an His testimony , but did not cover the image from the DR Congo in context .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these incor@@ rec@@ tions to date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere in all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse image search &quot; we can see how far information borders can be exceeded .
one of the search engine search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has been found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) in 344 pictures , which are very similar to the occup@@ ying picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mask of private pages , platforms soci@@ ally media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have gone mis@@ led reports , others have attemp@@ ts to de@@ filed the counter@@ s .
we have some examples of the ab@@ bre@@ ed use of limit@@ ations and they associated with the respective countries in connection , based on which page it had been published . thus , we want to display the range from more than by language alone .
from the listed listed countries ( which were linked together in some cases ) can be used several examples of ab@@ out@@ ous use .
here some cases , which can now be applied again ( on the map in Orange ) :
Map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of Fal@@ se Kop@@ pl@@ ings of the bil@@ ical dated from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ coloured countries show on pages or servers that are still available on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ se@@ ations are still available .
the countries in gray are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available through Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Bur@@ ma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion Forum ( addressed to al@@ al@@ ties and interested troops ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Iran , 2012 .
a open letter to the The@@ ology Association of The@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to the support of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and used to illustr@@ ate the picture of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria this photo was sent from the DR Congo as a demonstration of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion for@@ ums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of a mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo , with a Twe@@ et that symp@@ ath@@ y was down opposite the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other part of a b@@ log@@ gers , which claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya will be pursu@@ ed , because the photos of which ab@@ usive were used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
in Myanmar , the government of Myanmar published an inter@@ viewer , what she published as a &quot; abstr@@ acted news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this Jud@@ gment , which is published exclusively in English , includes also evidence on counter@@ feit pictures of rum@@ ours and used by extrem@@ ist groups to kill that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and and@@ ers@@ rum ( which often is widely used by bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , devoted to the members of the Russian @-@ orth@@ od@@ ox parish , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who sl@@ ay Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ an will have been cle@@ ared that Mon@@ ks and polit@@ icians have been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication is the picture still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explic@@ it@@ ly explained that the picture was not of the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ row@@ ed attack . &quot;
when the image later in connection with the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist the connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , on and dissolved a discussion under Muslims after the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre and the book on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve these events that they took over this events , which took place in the name of the Isl@@ ington &apos;s name .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was taken as a cover for the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ ained ) . but the messages that were associated with no religious text were attacked .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( in english ) , 2014 .
after a message that was report@@ edly written by a &quot; p@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos - on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , in circulation , it was translated discussions like this here on Vi@@ etnam@@ ese and explained the wrong indication .
from the message , in which the image of the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos .
there are further examples of a def@@ ective use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Gray ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but are no longer re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiop@@ ia , Sri Lanka , A@@ zer@@ bai@@ jan , Japan and possibly China .
( data collection with UR@@ L@@ s and time / date stamp exist at the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and merg@@ ed them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases first published only after the original accident of 2010 , the picture was ulti@@ mat@@ ely possibly a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong them@@ es or frames ( sections ) that pass through this post . the first frame is on religion .
the photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians through Muslims or - for the Defence of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is valu@@ ed in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth exam@@ ine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a de@@ eper question is however , what happens if readers can &apos;t give these pictures longer .
with social media there are only fifty people who have un@@ inten@@ ds to prac@@ tise the water around a trag@@ edy .
suggest@@ ing this mood of false and counter@@ feit information , that actual cru@@ sts are un@@ true and tast@@ es it &apos;s real hor@@ ror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of some pictures have been deb@@ ated in detail ( example , for example ) .
a argument is that that you can reg@@ ain from pictures of a gr@@ ading to det@@ ect the trag@@ edy . these images are even demanded by the victims itself .
at the same time , the conc@@ ern is that certain pictures of readers and vie@@ wers des@@ per@@ ate and you will find the ability to find Emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as these study en@@ rolled out how common media on it , to help others ) .
during this respect to discuss the news media , fact , fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting , because with Alg@@ orith@@ ms , to support the fight against &quot; f@@ ake News &quot; in which a picture has to be sug@@ ared , but actually ab@@ loos@@ ed from the context or completely ab@@ usive kind can be used .
however , any investigation false supplements should be also consider how internationally it can be internationally .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( can be und@@ isp@@ ut@@ able ) , language enthusi@@ astic can offer a selection of words from all over the world , difficult or not to transl@@ ate .
such words are in any language : you press certain situations or fe@@ el@@ ings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these ind@@ isp@@ ut@@ able words are already well known ( as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are conf@@ id@@ ated in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ tur@@ esa ) .
but all resist@@ s slightly dir@@ ts each attempt on a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation , and sometimes somewhat context are necessary to understand what is meant by this one .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in a online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and L@@ ingu@@ ist , &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird , decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ atu language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Mus@@ u@@ h to raise your parents in recognition of it , how to make you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The conveni@@ ence or sl@@ oth , who fe@@ els you , after being heated to cold days in the sun .
in my own words out of his blog About :
they fe@@ eds other cultures , reve@@ al another thought and sm@@ ells our curi@@ osity .
sometimes , as we have analy@@ ze the world to analy@@ ze us and classi@@ fy the l@@ ingu@@ ists on this page , even more this &quot; non @-@ translated &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .

after a statement of the dis@@ ast@@ ers of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are killed because of the flo@@ ods and mud .
over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and roughly 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe stay .
the ra@@ iny falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters deposits in some areas went back slowly .
health and hygiene rules of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos have an impression of the extent of the fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrophe :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water volumes of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .

I trust my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sted to me their children : she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute , we call for the rights of women .
in the next channels , we add rights to trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of um@@ bre@@ ll@@ as and humans , some hold the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf , bound from a American flag , other channels Par@@ tial against Islam@@ ar@@ ity .
my gir@@ l@@ friend look at me , saying , &quot; these things do not enter you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; , I ask .
I have already led this entertainment .
people , with whom I have been working or people who have been working for years now - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the far widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which had built up in her performance .
they mus@@ cular me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all of them .
we pract@@ ising our religion .
we identify us to be Muslim , at different . but some@@ how we all plug all in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective presentation , that once Muslims they don &apos;t want to pu@@ rest it .
Muslim Br@@ otherhood
I stand not alone .
that &apos;s even the poet , whose po@@ etry is selling in America , Rum@@ i .
which pictures are in mind if you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was an orth@@ od@@ ox@@ er Muslim pre@@ acher and sch@@ ol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an , and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his po@@ etry .
but in the Western performance , religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his po@@ etry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the re@@ duc@@ tive pictures of Muslims , the West books had been colon@@ ised since centuries .
this conf@@ id@@ ent image language is determined by the dark man who should be fe@@ ared , and the exotic woman that you should save .
after the 1970s Palestinian sci@@ entist , Edward S@@ aid trained in the 1970s , history behind these pictures .
but these pictures are still going to continue today .
our polit@@ icians , the news industry and Hollywood are still to continue .
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the telec@@ omm@@ unications industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty fo@@ urs@@ ors are domin@@ ate our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ u@@ ativ over@@ sh@@ atter@@ ed the reality that led in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries during the US in 2016 , while the US could not choose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ u@@ ativ gets ir@@ relevant to re@@ alize that if French , Muslim women suffer from their government to cover their scal@@ p in public buildings , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which they are both with two sides of the same medal .
a mighty group of control &quot; control &quot; is committed to the &quot; other . &quot;
this powerful f@@ ool we@@ aker mus@@ cular women who lead movements for change .
it looks like that the first Muslim pra@@ yers have been spoken on the American floor of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who had been brought together with slave .
it sol@@ ves the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ u@@ ativ has found our collective pre @-@ ordin@@ ation of such as deep and def@@ ective that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are to become an@@ tim@@ ely lim@@ b attacks and ch@@ ik@@ es .
because of this stories that we tell and tell the kind of what we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we can do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us understand the world .
and my industry is said to be failed to capture the scar of the 1.7 billion .
and we are rec@@ ie@@ ved here , where seven million Muslims are the highest degree in Europe in the highest degree &quot; religious group in America .
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African American citizens .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

we don &apos;t have to be a the@@ olog@@ ic experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional security box at the airport .
there are hundreds of stunning Muslim sch@@ ol@@ ars , Muslim activ@@ ists and inter@@ mitt@@ ent activ@@ ists that circul@@ ate , widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ist valves with fin@@ ances , th@@ ink tanks and experts for counter@@ feit detection which is already a Muslim ; or of which Islam is , man@@ ipul@@ ates .

I want to explain it .
I was born as Muslims who was born to be Muslims , but when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social sci@@ entist blas@@ ph@@ ased life , they attack them back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging to affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour is not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would see my neigh@@ bour , my rock in the fire that I am Muslims , if it could walk through the 15 metres of concrete and air , that can separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I saw her in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the protection that is called the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every of them I get back three times .
I be@@ fore@@ hand that it is protected from evil , evil which can see , and evil which can &apos;t see it .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim breeding is always part of my shadow .

Muslims will be to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have created all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means that the first fli@@ er bom@@ b of history was rejected by a Muslim country in front of a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my Grand@@ mother , a native , k@@ ash@@ mir of the British Empire , called the newspapers of his time as &quot; haz@@ ard@@ ous , &quot; since he led the first mos@@ que in England .

it means that four hundred years ago , the first prayer of the first prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a fre@@ ed black sl@@ aves with the name Bil@@ al .

there is another group that has been exposed , exp@@ on@@ ally by the &quot; others &quot; created .

initiative for nar@@ rator wants to pres@@ erve urban language diversity
panel of stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , under license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can it be possible to join here and now , despite a voice barrier with someone at the connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ bb@@ n Perry , founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the creation of stories in their original language has an answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported some more than another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ translation blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language diversity of major cities and di@@ ble .
in fact , in urban regions such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has been conducted since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as little languages are not given to children there .
the project applies to the project :
the mass mortality of the world may be avo@@ ided , if we do towns , the di@@ vers@@ ität - safe areas where residents must not forget to hear them .
while &quot; hear often this to understand , &quot; don &apos;t want to understand these events instead , &quot; the listening to feel to feel , link . &quot;
this format will present their story first in their own language , and transl@@ ate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , so their goods and its representation is that the audi@@ ences can be turned aside .
they call laugh@@ ing and emot@@ ions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is nar@@ row@@ ed in language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the co@@ at@@ ings of Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou accounts also the opportunity to clar@@ ify the land of typical Ge@@ br@@ aries of t@@ ales .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel of Has@@ en and the Pav@@ ian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
after he asked the importance of his F@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to a public that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad Gr@@ in@@ sen it divi@@ des his feeling of in@@ cl@@ us@@ iv@@ ity :
you got up !
they were atten@@ tively ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and organiz@@ ers hop@@ efully to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project , to contact T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS to organize their own proj@@ ect@@ ings .
Puerto Rico requested by the USA Re@@ fest@@ ive of the State
with the aim of a new check of public deb@@ ts of Puerto Rico , who took over 72 million US dollars on the past 3 April 2017 , took several religious and bour@@ geois organisations involved in a mass of endem@@ ic form@@ ations ; the Mar@@ sch started the capital of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ d@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil front for the ne@@ ur@@ ity of the debt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church Assembly , Puerto Ric@@ os .
the adv@@ oc@@ ate of the re@@ struc@@ turing of deb@@ ts have also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the United States .
this is its demand :
the people Puerto R@@ wan@@ dan calls that the polit@@ icians , B@@ än@@ ker and government agencies , responsible for deb@@ ts are responsible for their cor@@ ruption .
we call for financial examination and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public deb@@ ts , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate rem@@ un@@ eration that acts in favor of the economy .
we will pres@@ pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os is ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between formation and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be able to canc@@ el their pension payments .
we require different measures .
the island - not into the State of the United States in the United States , suffer from a serious financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an reign@@ ing non @-@ profit organisation without party integration on the soci@@ o economic development , a law on the state manager , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ric@@ os requires a long re@@ struc@@ turing of state infrastructure .
without the outside of the outside , we will run without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens , the people will be rejected by the people .

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ que Saf@@ adi , has been missing in a year since more than one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after having been arrested by the Syrian regime , he continued his supp@@ orters and members of the campaign for his freedom , and remember the contributions that he performed for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : pub@@ lica , the annual conference for the digital culture , which will be align@@ ed to Berlin , dedicated to the event of the # Free@@ B@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientific writer at Book Prize for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of the so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &quot; finished books within three to five days , las@@ e ex@@ cer@@ pts from the book of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published in the last year and is licensed here , contains a number of sent@@ ences which deal with free culture in the presence of suppression .
it is an hom@@ age to bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to be mounted to movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are connected with which this is connected .
activ@@ ists , artist , designer , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have also been working on site to ren@@ ew our news fe@@ eds and create something out of our experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ que Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and ac@@ claimed Internet volunteers since March 15 , 2012 is imprisoned in Syria .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
we have since ever been running any information about current state or stay .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the entitled Collec@@ tive memory gives his friends and his family a voice looking forward to his release and want to know him back in his normal life and liber@@ ty in freedom .
how to see Bas@@ que will pay a high price for his participation in free culture , has many of us begin to re@@ cover their own dest@@ in@@ ies , acts and decisions .
why are we now ?
what did we op@@ ted us ?
what do we have given in this process of evidence extreme belie@@ fs ?
the Web@@ developer of Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been det@@ ained by the Syrian government agencies in March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institu@@ tion , which was transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer No@@ ura Gh@@ az@@ i reported that the military police base on the basis of a &quot; str@@ eng ge@@ heim &quot; reported command of the military tribunal of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
Gh@@ az@@ i reported that she was cont@@ acted by persons on 12 November 2015 , having submitted themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad administration and replaced by a con@@ voy against her husband in knowledge .
however , his stay and state remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , bas@@ sel played a cru@@ cial role in which access to the Internet and to knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ olog@@ ian and currently translated from the lad@@ der of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the Bas@@ que , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ otypes as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construc@@ t the ancient ruins of Palm@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the scen@@ sion of many civil servants and here merg@@ es Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ rel@@ ate traditions and pers@@ onic influence .
bas@@ sel was not yet able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS had all these things to do this architecture , which is not only the cultural heritage of Sys@@ ri@@ ens but the world em@@ bodies .
this strip into the digital archae@@ ology and the con@@ servation has created a period of time formed for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of un@@ estimated value .
based on this project , Bas@@ sel was not able to complete this project .
No@@ ura Gh@@ az@@ i also contributed to the book , and writes about the passion of their man , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream about freedom and taught me to comp@@ ile them to poor .
I have been over@@ whel@@ med when I called his name .
Bas@@ sel had made me English when he was found in jail .
I have learned to read English well to read and talk to speak .
he has always dealt with every knowledge that has asked . he has taught other in@@ ad@@ missions , English to read and talk to speak .
Bas@@ que has opened me the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also brought other in@@ ad@@ missions , as they ut@@ ili@@ ze computers , at least theore@@ ti@@ cally , without that they actually stopped their hands in their hands .
Gh@@ az@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ sab@@ bath which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was found in prison .
Bas@@ sel and No@@ ura have worked together for a year long along the book .
she k@@ iss@@ ed the ly@@ rics to him , when she visited him , he delivered them out of the Arab in English .
the book is explic@@ it@@ ly available .

the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens in every visit ,
that I should fall in the world of your en@@ chan@@ ting eyes ,
that I left the crew in the moment , in which we are poor ,
that any of the danger is no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sho@@ cks and watch@@ men
I forget the prison length of the prison

since the beginning of the protest against the B@@ ash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads in 2011 , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 65@@ .000 people .

Mos@@ am@@ bik@@ inis re@@ acted with anger on a cor@@ ruption , when a government member , returned to the workplace in the state appar@@ atus , committed to cor@@ ruption in which the cor@@ ruption was committed .
this was arrested by Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other accused were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza was from 2005 to 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and ordered immediately his re@@ inst@@ ation into the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the General Public Pro@@ secution of the Republic that had no obst@@ ru@@ ction to rel@@ ate the application for Cam@@ b@@ aza , again his old posts , since the company had no discipl@@ ine procedure after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants are not good .
the Centre for public integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , CIP ) , a local institu@@ tion which imp@@ lic@@ ate public transpar@@ ency in an interview with Deutsche Welle &apos;s decision to re@@ loc@@ ate the director :
represents a return on cor@@ ruption against cor@@ ruption and illustr@@ ates the lack of transpar@@ ency and even a return in regard to the efforts of our legal system , the CIP .
what we should assume that the company would have to have a discipl@@ inary process against rein@@ for@@ cement .
however , the firm was silent and las@@ h@@ est no reasonable steps for use of the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio Vaz , a major voice in the mos@@ cu@@ ous social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well as &quot; contra@@ dic@@ tory &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a compet@@ ent type that he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence .
he could pay attention and motiv@@ ating re@@ ins , he could adv@@ ise and his image pol@@ ishing .
but because he is ink@@ able to enter into the company , he has helped to add damage to the company .
consequently , it is obviously : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be paid for his silence .
g@@ av@@ ely !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ am@@ bik@@ ers and student of politics in Brazil , says the director of no Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was re@@ warded by the state , because he could not believe him , that one would be re@@ warded to someone else , who has already ins@@ ult the state as a massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ al to serve and to serve the state , * he had already serve a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead of itself the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was used the state , as a handy it was to become an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself has become ti@@ red , the pre @-@ charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was re@@ warded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te is preferred to re@@ mind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to re@@ mind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Mos@@ am@@ bik@@ ers not only remain for the first independent President in memory , but also as a sharp , single @-@ cutting and - in the way of proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous represent@@ ations , when he confirmed energ@@ etic , that &quot; a hon@@ orable man should be able to be able to sell his own individual interest , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a amb@@ ition man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not apply to his amp@@ positions .
an ambitious man is a criminal in@@ criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions also re@@ jects :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he sat 10 years old and came free .
and today it sets him the company , where he has betra@@ yed money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - BE@@ α@@ λ@@ α@@ λ@@ к . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 . May 2017
Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( zu dt . : @ truth ) states that cri@@ min@@ ality in Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
in fact , in # Moz@@ ambi@@ que Die@@ b and att@@ endant of the # Fre@@ li@@ mo p@@ ays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , to the longest possible imprisonment , returns to the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que - Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo ( @ Em@@ ild@@ o@@ Sam@@ bo ) 11 May 2017
Facebook block@@ ed the consist@@ ency word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to infin@@ ity
the Bur@@ sting word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ er@@ b@@ se or sp@@ lit@@ ters .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted
according to the Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network of its mail from the net because they revealed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still deb@@ ated , it is usually used to refer to people in East Indian origin , or generally as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook makes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or so called &quot; ( in bur@@ mes@@ ial script ) as part of an initiative to enter the widespread problem in Bur@@ ma into the social network .
over the last years , the A@@ scen@@ sion has been given radi@@ cal nation@@ alist movements to the word an extremely ab@@ ru@@ sted K@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , there is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists than hat@@ chback against Muslims , which represent a min@@ ority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort , hat@@ ched speech in Myanmar , the company has provided a lot of sen@@ ds content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; is commonly associated with rac@@ ism , but the word do not calls automatically speaking .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people reported that also postcards were discussed in which they have discussed the use of the word , or dou@@ b@@ ts of his own needs to be expressed .
in addition there are several bur@@ mes@@ os words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letter as also other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ alter ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ k@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ e@@ book@@ n@@ utzer A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words by the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; as follows :
one post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends at the spiritual kind of being asked if they could cr@@ ush his back pain when he made a word play .
the set ku la - &quot; C@@ ure &quot; ( ku ) + the Frag@@ ew@@ ort ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - res@@ em@@ bles the sh@@ aving term , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win wit@@ ch is the opinion that they will decrease a radi@@ cal nation@@ alists , however , st@@ ressed that Facebook analy@@ tical is being min@@ t before it sol@@ ves all post@@ s that is in the sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
Facebook proce@@ eds the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word .
the automation will not understand what you write on Fac@@ il@@ ook .
what you should make it instead , check the post carefully and check it by adding the words to the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ alter Age ) .
the Good News is that these three nation@@ alists will spread out a quite good lesson .
now it is at time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
while the promotion is a powerful signal to all send , the Hass@@ le language , the efficiency of this strategy is not long long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have demonstrated that the users can simply start social networks , using social networks , a new word or an alternative writing of the arch@@ si@@ ent word to use their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to delete his post@@ s , when he would only agree to his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is :
... when I was caught on this new law of Facebook , I made a post to keep my Facebook friends that the word was locked .
ir@@ radiation was removed my post by Facebook and me , the li@@ ken , post@@ en and parts of In@@ hold for 24 hours , because the post &quot; the &quot; Facebook community &quot; is not accepted . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of postcards from humans , which have no negative de@@ vi@@ es or simply try to show their opinion against them , radi@@ cal nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ Language :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
in the post , the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook could have been doing more than the beginning of the initiative , for example the bur@@ sting Internet community will ask :
Facebook like a prosp@@ erous inten@@ tion to decrease rac@@ ism in Bur@@ ma by their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
such words will only be able to bring more hat@@ red within the different communities .
additionally it seems , as if they started using this without local context or technical support , such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Er@@ bs@@ enc@@ ur@@ ry &apos; . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistake , they tried not temp@@ ted the post@@ pon@@ ent post@@ s .
if you have just more respect for the 15 million benefits , they would have a big turnover , would be great .
Fac@@ e@@ books automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has su@@ cked for a lot of don@@ ors among users .
instead of it serious , users make users on Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ Language to see if their post@@ s are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posters that have no hate speech but still have been removed :
used with approval .
the bur@@ mes@@ o text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and look for a Indian movie .
only to try if Facebook contains the Post , which contains the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;

in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious findings have had used to extend social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks the violence in the con@@ greg@@ ations in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to bring out hat@@ red on his bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control .
but rather than simply to handle the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it could have been better running in the context than on the code of focused initi@@ atives and lear@@ nt from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 038 ; Tobago is finished with the children &apos;s before
a wedding ring in the sand .

the Children &apos;s Wo@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illeg@@ ally .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country voted un@@ anim@@ ously decided to offer this practice such a marriage @-@ capable of married at 18 .
in front of this change of the former members , some members had gone du@@ istic and Muslim religi@@ ons , and in May 2016 there came to a great public authorities . then , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country was gathered that the state did not match the state that the state did not have the maturity . &quot;
this happened un@@ certain of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago a contrac@@ tor of the UN children &apos;s legal intervention is the min@@ ors than , for every person under 18 years . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married at 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistics of the country aff@@ ir@@ med that of 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 .
online @-@ pet@@ itions and social media movements that were en@@ rolled together , laws about the kinder@@ garten , followed by foot and refresh@@ ing a great support . und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly put them into consider@@ ation this result .
nevertheless , don &apos;t work any smo@@ oth@@ ly .
a Hind@@ u leaders , e.g. had any concerns the cr@@ itic of the children &apos;s tur@@ f , they shou@@ ldn &apos;t be dam@@ ned to take care of their own mat@@ ters . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition made mat@@ ched for st@@ resses in this actually un@@ comp@@ lic@@ ated matter , and somet@@ ime there came dou@@ b@@ ts to agree if the opposition might agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill had decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including one woman ) of opposition and an independent , which he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where he would already make a simple majority to the law .
now , only the president of the country must agree to the law and let the law be announced .
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country has a status update , which once viewed the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of the children before was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes in favour and no one against it .
after having decided in the Senate , the draft can now be used for the law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws have been finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was cloth@@ ed in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and needed od@@ ede , which has disappeared the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illeg@@ ally , and that &apos;s almost every price .
during A@@ bel Jackson &apos;s opinion it was definitely long enough to watch the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas sur@@ happy that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which occup@@ ying :
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who list@@ ened to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society that was quite open on it , how important the appointment of the law is remarkable :
the marriage @-@ capable old age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independ@@ ently of the religious affili@@ ation to 18 years .
the draft for the change of the husband has been decided on June 9 , 2017 .
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , there are 41 members , and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were against the law , agreed for the law .
the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tobago is no more allowed .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ min@@ age@@ ild@@ ab@@ use .
many thanks to all activ@@ ists who made it unusual .
congratulations to .
a Dan@@ ke to our members .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma M@@ aha Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organisation of the country .
during the months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj Mah@@ ar@@ aj informed his inten@@ tion , the ju@@ di@@ cial steps should be adopted , and it seems to be the law en@@ ligh@@ tened .
during the general lawyer Paris Al ra@@ wi , a fe@@ eder of the law , thought it would be law@@ ful when Mah@@ ar@@ aj opposed the law to the law , wish most social media users , one would go on the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
rather , if we wish , instead of the discussion so commonly found that we wish to say the state into our bedroom , that the state that may protects our daughters that they may benefit from large , hard fleet males , which are compared to them in the benefit , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that there is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a ju@@ di@@ cial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places on the world where the children &apos;s before in different grad@@ ations legal or still the norm is , although there are laws that they are talking about .

by web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English Wikipedia page was announced on January 18 , 2012 , opposite to the S@@ OP@@ A ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright Act in the USA , internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey has now locked the popular and to the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle @-@ based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for Tag is clear how important the platform is for users to find helpful and reliable information .
both students as well as rep@@ orter and fans of TV series felt against the pl@@ ywood .
although many techn@@ ics users have been used , converting tools for block@@ ed websites ( a current article by New York Times that Turkey has the third largest V@@ PN prev@@ alen@@ ce of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users are not in this category .
although Turkey joined by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society on Harvard University , will find regular log @-@ up of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
to China , Turkey is the most famous country of the world when it goes around the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues remains closed , several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages are now locked ( pages that will be updated the content of Wikipedia and frequently ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Planning File System ) than the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which does not make a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is not@@ ice@@ able in spite of the legal ban .
in a logical post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via the cur@@ l of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to keep Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so , the opportunity to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and convic@@ ted .
this can help users to view all Wikipedia content , even though it can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ k@@ ipe@@ di@@ a.org himself .
IP@@ FS announced that this step is performed independ@@ ently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and only around screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to ren@@ ew the sper@@ m .
c@@ rist@@ ian Con@@ sun@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has an open source of Wikipedia , as well as the Wik@@ i@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that every use can be locked up by similar Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages if stored in the country of Wikipedia .
Con@@ sun@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ r@@ ah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Moz@@ illa in Pan@@ ig@@ r@@ ah@@ i &apos;s Open speaks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a Mir@@ ror .
one gets to the other UR@@ L , which is not the original . that which one can see , is of Wikipedia .
essenti@@ ally , the server runs on the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even though this is locked in Turkey .
because this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese Wild@@ animal photographer uses his camera to make attention to the need for natural protection

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never pleased . they were gone with bad positioned mot@@ ifs and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated him even a camera to wear and try to gra@@ zing the situation .
at that time he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar was trying to bring home to the international stage .
and his home location directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that len@@ ess the attention to Nep@@ als wild@@ life .
he described the Facebook like this high @-@ quality location in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a pas@@ sion@@ ate wild photographer ! !
I just rested me at home when you called Nav@@ ar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) , and he had received a call of my father that would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River on the shore of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river revol@@ t is only a few minutes away from the tourist destination of Sau@@ r@@ aha .
I went immediately with my camera , and was in few minutes there .
my father had wat@@ ched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the Leopard was and I immediately began to kne@@ e pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stret@@ ching a cooperation with the authorities to make global recognition for Nep@@ als nature and wants to be the understanding of the deep that wild animals are not so f@@ urch@@ asing as they look .
and he should know it , because he got ti@@ ers from face to face :
a tiger can not be anno@@ ying from the mind of the sheep in sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also at home in the way home when suddenly the king of the Bus@@ ch@@ crafts appeared . he immediately go immediately , and let &apos;s see me through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , placed Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the funding of Nep@@ als nature and wild@@ life is not always simple .
he was waiting for 22 days , and lived in a tent at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings . up to 12 days it lasted until he could shoot a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live in the vicinity of tourist information .
take a look at some of these photos .

years after the wedding was Indian women for the first time , to arrange the name of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la Jam G@@ ay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , originally written on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , a award winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was re@@ produced here as part of a Content @-@ Sh@@ aring Convention .
in many parts Indi@@ genous people avoid women with the largest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even by older men in the family .
instead , use a Pr@@ on@@ omen or tell &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ err@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect the husband due to the husband &apos;s husband , as well as the fear of consequences , they should inter@@ pret@@ ending the norm in reality .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state to O@@ dis@@ ha by a headlight level and handed out by their family and the village community , after being addressed a married relations with name .
the tradition has not even sp@@ reading their wives , too , is also common under men . however , they have far more widespread use before it , however , they should not return to this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health@@ care , and house fr@@ auen , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main spec@@ im@@ s of the city .
it is a place only for them only , to whom they discuss the host@@ ility of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss them .
when one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , who is operated by community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and has set itself for the construction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ worked for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of intern@@ ships , such as children &apos;s homes up to the feder@@ ation of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ Inf@@ ected , and guides this clubs .
it reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them to am@@ bass@@ ad@@ ate inside the wall@@ paper at the same time .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion group , hand@@ led by women who call their hus@@ bands not by name .
she has decided for this topic , because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves .
the name of their hus@@ bands are not loud as loud , a Br@@ auch , who they have pleaded not guilty and have never changed them in question .
Roh@@ ini we@@ ep :
this tradition test@@ if@@ ies that a wife respec@@ ts her husband and wish him a long life .
one woman who doesn &apos;t know it is regarded as a broken , as wife without mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deep conf@@ id@@ ent that we have never made us up to these discussions round about this discussion .
at the beginning of the Roh@@ ini , the husband had never called her husband , so far , she never had called her name , as it runs at home .
she showed the video of the discussions round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were still long , after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and told me to call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ trust in luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never heard . some believed that it was a good cause , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in ais@@ le .
Roh@@ ini bat any participant in the name of her husband with various fe@@ el@@ ings - happy , off@@ ended , mo@@ ist , lov@@ ingly , and so on .
then they asked them , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , meaning that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it be not equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought to the name of their hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the bre@@ ach of a year @-@ old tradition , in which he married women the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
one woman was so sh@@ u@@ prising that they were just before the whole exercise , and another decided to allow the whole fru@@ str@@ ate fru@@ stration against him and his family trying to c@@ ursed him .
the expression of their faces were ek@@ st@@ atically .
I think , I will never forget it .
even in the ad@@ ren@@ al sw@@ ap about it , with an ancient Br@@ auch , the women chose to try to try out her husband and their hus@@ bands in the name .
and they held their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a wife called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas were women in the head : his wife could not stop to stop his name .
another member member decided to do it for dinner before the entire family .
when her mother @-@ law she touched her , she was afraid , saying that it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of an participant in war was less favour@@ able and the situation in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported as women attemp@@ ts to stop other practices , such as the Tr@@ agen of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the fore@@ head which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women need to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the cin@@ no@@ red point when it is open too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard it to bear him .
the other women do not have complete this , but mine , they are now in a better position to choose to carry him to some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange up their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip with every discussion club .
usually we pack@@ ets lunch and water , and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make women who hear what could hear , &quot; says it .
in the last months , they celebrated their own bir@@ th@@ days for the first time in her life with cakes . they dance and talking about things which they never had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working here for so many years ago and yet I have been talking about some things , for example like our identity in our hus@@ bands , never been doing so hon@@ est@@ ly .
it fe@@ els great , certain things to say , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion group , we have under@@ go about the concept of glory and how it is associated with clothing .
some women in the group have been named Sar@@ is since her marriage .
for most of it is okay , but some wanted to bear a sage @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a p@@ ants ; they don &apos;t have baptized .
after the disp@@ ute and discussion of the pre@@ ferences of your own h@@ anger , the Mor@@ al is associated with Sar@@ is and much more , curi@@ ous Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion group , allowing women to carry them .
next , they now have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can bear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will create it .
the question that in the five months have already been changed since their first discussion club already changed , Roh@@ ini confirmed that the things are slowly into the rolls :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women tried it a couple of time , but then heard it again to tell their husband &apos;s name .
some , en@@ rolled me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two say to the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women bear at any time of interest in their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion club knowledge that the changes that they would like to reach more freedom of movement or your own hang@@ s - at the end of a difficult navig@@ ating river .
by taking each other self @-@ trust , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
any of us is a vic@@ tim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman in the club continues to go home and other people , what we speak and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

Singapore : City or Land ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question is st@@ up@@ id , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered a city as a town .
this mark has trig@@ gered a debate in the b@@ log@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the An@@ w@@ al chamber Association of the State of New York , the minister said that many people conqu@@ ered the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it &apos;s support that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one contained in question whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , whereby most people go an error .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice , &quot; the logic oper@@ ators &quot; to def@@ end logic oper@@ ators to def@@ end power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and ship@@ ments , this valuable country is created , we hear that we ulti@@ mat@@ ely be no country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the cause of a escape before the respon@@ si@@ bilities , a mandatory last .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am stated there were not very Nobel : he def@@ ended up an idea , according to what you could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , and in view of what he appeared in@@ feed und@@ em@@ ocratic .
however , it was on the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared to the same cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York .
these cities are dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally .
as soon as you reach the core point of the Th@@ reads , again the good old fo@@ unders came from the aut@@ or@@ itative mach@@ in@@ ers that they for@@ c@@ ord@@ ed dem@@ ocr@@ ats , since they fit it better to their power .
in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am there were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our je@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really not answers .
according to the relevant questions , he secured a r@@ ational r@@ ational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on his mind that they haven &apos;t understood this conclusion .
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult .
if Singapore is no country , but a city is , thus to what land belongs to our city ...
shortly , I understand nothing .
I would be very gr@@ ate@@ ful if our commercial K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take up the effort to stop this point when he was paid up to be part of the City of Singapore to be part of the city of Singapore .
by An@@ on on his comments , he demonstr@@ ating regarding the crit@@ ics that one should begin to understand the entire tran@@ script of the conference , to understand the context of statements by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to the Singapore a city and no country .
Read the heading .
when he said that Singapore rather a &quot; city &quot; be considered a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we are looking forward to free and just@@ ified elections .
he also has Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party win ? ) .
when he said , Singapore &quot; would not be a country , &quot; he doesn &apos;t mean it in that sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the ju@@ di@@ cial minister of Singapore has said , ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w and the members of the old Gar@@ de which I expected - whether I agree with them , or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but by K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of political leader of Singapore , I doubt and I &apos;m not sure that he really believes , right and consci@@ ous what he is def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ asek review frag@@ ments the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Lord Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am resol@@ ved a mistake , or was an Fre@@ ud@@ scher digest@@ ers ?
if Singapore is no country , we will only viewed as an independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is ali@@ ke and city .
since he plays an important role in the government &apos;s government , are the statements by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am of serious importance .
why does people aff@@ ord the people of their military service , they def@@ end her city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister In@@ vo@@ icing ?
what is the value of our rose personnel ?
are we the citizen of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the year of a Dec@@ ade , Singapore is always a town :
&quot; I don &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this pro@@ position seems to have many people of Singapur . ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we were always a town / arch@@ ip@@ elago .
I can understand that we often say often as &quot; the defence of the country especially , &quot; etc . listen , but that &apos;s not really true .
we should speak rather from the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked recently its editor : what is the aspect of the aspect of your living areas or home country ?
their respon@@ ses are published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ours about certain pieces of the world reve@@ als and a different Fac@@ ette will be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , Canada and Japan .
the question that is home to me in Japan : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , and answer me . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
according to the situation in which the situation is taking place , there is a pol@@ ite , interest in his con@@ vers@@ aries to show personal questions .
in my clar@@ ification then follow the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadian people are still to be conf@@ used for Americans if they are kept for Americans , but do not mind me .
for someone who does not know , there is little that diff@@ ers from Americans to us .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadian flag flies well at their back@@ pack when they are travelling .
all love Canadian .
Americans , by contrast ... .
it was also known as I began 20 years ago , through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th September .
Canadian @-@ fl@@ yers have always applied to their bag@@ gage , to distingu@@ ish their American neigh@@ bo@@ urs around their American neigh@@ bo@@ urs .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gender equality are legal legal in Canada already since 2005 !
all appear to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also considered as the toler@@ ant country from ethnic groups compared to ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we are nice .
I hate the .
first , I &apos;ve got many American friends who I ad@@ m@@ ire very ad@@ mi@@ red .
there would be nothing worth to make me change from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called , is said within the reason of reason - such as the gut@@ ti@@ red , gentle , but trag@@ ic imp@@ ur@@ wise figure N@@ ed Flanders of &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders would be that in fact a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nett &quot; has no person@@ ality .
there are no corners , and edges , nothing that can be cast out .
harm@@ less , his name is un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting , and earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , watching from the things that pass around .
I would even go to say that the wish is free and alone to be a major core of Canadian .
we t@@ end to care for us to care of our own mat@@ ters .
what is nice as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadian people don &apos;t talk about the fence with neigh@@ bo@@ urs .
we lack a warm heart , open kindness , which I have to connect with my American friends .
fortunately , for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , then Just@@ in Tru@@ deau the stage to show that Kan@@ adier is more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has taken something very sex@@ y .

the post@@ war company recovered only very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years has passed since the Georg@@ isch @-@ abstr@@ act war officially ended , but his fol@@ ds are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of Northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al will show significant pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal pool of Ab@@ ch@@ elles .
various ethnic groups like Rus@@ sians , Gre@@ eks , Turn @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ er and Armen@@ ians lived and worked as Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the biggest part of Rus@@ sians and dep@@ ases in the area .
such sett@@ l@@ ements are called in Ab@@ ch@@ elles also .
in the pre @-@ war period there still lived more than 10,000 people , today only a few hundred people live in these spirits .
this phenom@@ enon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al characteristic .
since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people had hardly risen by a decade .
around 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls on him hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk with you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ?
it &apos;s still clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens , who served all the community .
now there are only paved road with f@@ ender Prac@@ tical buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and had its contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , leaving the district since .
the city of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha are living approximately fifty inhabitants .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks like .

two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they move back immediately .
&quot; our mother has b@@ anned us , we let us take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply prohib@@ ited us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girls fl@@ atter@@ ed her gir@@ l@@ friend something too and suddenly leave the destroyed building and dis@@ appear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultiv@@ ation of land products for own requirements ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable .
it &apos;s difficult to come to the laps .
the district administration supplies in winter free candles and bread to the villages .

Gal@@ ina wants to take no financial aid from their daughter , and they wa@@ ited to support their young grand@@ son instead .

in Mexico with &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses the mig@@ rants on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Brack@@ et was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI@@ .org .
on the way of mig@@ rants who cross Europe or Latin America , will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a young woman with a cor@@ ro@@ sive pink frame and gold @-@ colored s@@ cour@@ ing in t@@ eddy Bear .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and has grown there . however , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this top name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) became a target for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans , who are on the journey .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep in simple rooms , with gro@@ unded , ab@@ stain@@ ing walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no signs to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an mig@@ rants were here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , who start the people in full inf@@ ants and start the upper part of the coast to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the time it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez was already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some are also hat@@ ched outside on board .
she would like to re@@ ject it .
they also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they bought them medic@@ ations that they cannot pay them , they tou@@ red them with a bal@@ m to swe@@ eten the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ iao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if m@@ um Africa was a reasonable top name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ iao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a j@@ og@@ hur@@ l ) po@@ inting with Conc@@ ep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and h@@ opes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Brack@@ en .
&quot; Yes , yes , &quot; answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to you because African women are very nice women .
really loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ iao travels with his sister , the h@@ opes to go to Boston for her husband and the three children .
you have already lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way into the United States , to make normal one first stop in South America and then to the north .
the family had belonged to other road accompanied by Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; Felix Mich@@ elet , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ kaner are often travel together and they that the Afri@@ cans already speak on Wh@@ ats@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his way , Mich@@ elet has lived in Brazil and has worked as a buil@@ der for building the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ nit@@ et to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez Contact .
&quot; m@@ um Africa is our mother and we never let them go , &quot; reply to smile . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests have often tell their guests , if they have continued to gra@@ b them , or to report her over the course of their journey .
they declared that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know a lot about Africa , but their guests have brought you to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps known here , but it &apos;s not the only radio hope for mig@@ rants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a S@@ ack@@ gasse street to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family res@@ orts mig@@ rants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bu@@ ffer@@ ets are sold too expensive for numerous African mig@@ rants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on ce@@ il@@ ings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ ery outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border on the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived there for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his work in the United States .
the majority of mig@@ rants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from men who wanted to try out of him money without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for a accommodation and an unknown , an all par@@ ent , has offered it their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives and attemp@@ ting to decide where the next steps should go .
Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
to cons@@ ult the travel@@ ers calm your phone .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a large majority from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but she is nost@@ alg@@ ic because of them which went away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , it fe@@ eds their album with many photos .
there are one of their daughter with African hair fle@@ ece that you made a Kund@@ al@@ in , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travel@@ ers more , boy and Alte .
she mo@@ cked mo@@ urn@@ ing while she was brie@@ fly .
&quot; Ya @-@ eron &quot; is repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their phones a surveillance app .
a Check @-@ Point for personal communication units in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter Us@@ ers &quot; ( 中@@ 文 )
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic min@@ ority region in the Western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile user using the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an area of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell al@@ ies , where it shows the District government , a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the notification , the app &quot; App is said to get access to terrorist information . &quot;
however , however , the authorities have also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kazak@@ h women in aut@@ onomous ili Kazak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they were installed shortly after they had installed the app , news with a private chat group .
in the communication of the police conf@@ used that the app is the sources and distribution of terrorism , and would follow together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harm@@ ful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ ed por@@ no@@ graphic website , by online fr@@ aud , Tro@@ jan@@ ern and ph@@ ased pages to make users to make sure how much time they come online to remote control your own home net@@ working .
this App with the fil@@ tering for min@@ ors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a App with these features can be used can be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker helps to man@@ ipul@@ ating the home network of a person to man@@ ipul@@ ating or from it .
these introduction stands in line with other measures to control of digital activities in this region .
while information about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China are most likely to focus on the experience of users in the greater cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ ow@@ ers for those who live in dist@@ ant ethnic min@@ ority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to reduce un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often occur extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ on Internet .
this was published on Twitter based media Out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( Ar@@ en@@ zu@@ rich News in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point , on the police officers un@@ checked , if they have installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app in 10 days .
if you have discovered an Check@@ point using a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for the techn@@ ological development .
they are forced to use those people who are intended for older people to use .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by sub@@ marine technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( Gal@@ ician ) , in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which indicates that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the hard disk of the computer .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , which minim@@ ize sp@@ reading of illegal content .
all government agencies , authorities and associated facilities including universities and research instit@@ utes are ob@@ li@@ ged to follow the instructions of the Cy@@ ber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication devices .
a current report of Freedom House , an American Human Rights organization , also mentioned this new surveillance method :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a decree with the directive to all residents and entrepren@@ e@@ urs , supporting external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ e@@ books and media storage cards &quot; at the local police .
the inten@@ tion is obviously to identify themselves &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . this promotion , however , viol@@ ated the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives it pen@@ al@@ ties for a whole number of other verses , including those who refer to pe@@ ac@@ efully religious or political communications .

this is the first six reports in the row &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane acts his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you looked at you and consider that you are entirely alone in a place where everything has disappeared .
everything changed after and dis@@ sol@@ ves and a truth which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one who makes their names all the glory .
one that has be@@ aten in a list of po@@ ems and ex@@ pres@@ sions that no met@@ aph@@ s fail .
but when you come back the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the per@@ formers - trans@@ form the characters in nature and blood , and all cry to death .
all dou@@ b@@ ts himself in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even though the earth is stretched out on the axis of the un@@ he@@ al . you will clearly that you are between the walls which your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone to stone .
they have arrested me and arrested my father in three times , but that was not enough to re@@ alize my lesson - as the b@@ oss of security services - with the promise that it would be a pleasure for the fourth time .
he set his power over us , by giving even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn apart during a peaceful prot@@ ests like un@@ her@@ b from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to be the city &apos;s darkness with &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ er . &quot;
all the distri@@ cts co@@ v@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was silent , un@@ condition@@ ally , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that led to the ar@@ ter@@ ies with state of government and their compli@@ ces .
during the third night , things were a little so@@ othing after the power supply in the quarter were to work .
I interrup@@ ted the silence by holding several times , &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends decided to me ; we al@@ lied us to a glori@@ ous picture that fulfilled my expectations full and fulfilled .
in such a moment you will be aware that you delivered the Spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the sm@@ ell .
I received a call from my father : &quot; makes you ready to make us at the military safety building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can hin@@ ted - nothing can return to you your voice , after you have got your way up to the service of security services from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father had already there , even as I do now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear how you are &apos; all@@ ah@@ u &apos; , or you are only encour@@ aged enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot;
his eyes filled in me .
&quot; and you mo@@ urn@@ ing to look to me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with cour@@ age .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , nau@@ sea ; perhaps on the revolution .
I was so safe to me when I said : &quot; I would not have thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never heard you to look into eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such a dis@@ ast@@ rous consequences for me , and yet I have no word from what I said .
&quot; then he is in sol@@ itary and his father equal with it . &quot;
&quot; his father like this . &quot;
the structure of this flu@@ ids , lies me in the nose until today .
he was sentenced to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ian torture that I was exposed to the monthly torture .
I cried out the farm .
in the first office I let everything I go with me .
afterwards , by the yard and the second office , which leads through a speed of the individual cells .
I pre@@ ach to me all details before I entered the room .
unlike otherwise , they have been al@@ located to me a larger one .
I have to share them with only one another prisoners , and it may wait for me without waiting for their permission .
after some minutes that felt like a whole life left the civil servants , and I left the communication on a well @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I knew that my cell floors was a &quot; initial appearance . &quot;
after long Z@@ ö@@ ger he finally answered me .
appar@@ ently , in no one of the surrounding cells there was a strong man @-@ middle age that looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there is no mark@@ ers to recogn@@ ise that there is no mark@@ ers here ; we are all numbers only .
&quot; perhaps someone who sounds like my sound ? &quot;
all respon@@ ses linked to its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will he@@ ars instantly .
the investig@@ ator had in@@ sured me , they would be fre@@ ed when I stayed .
li@@ ar .
I would like to have had a bird po@@ che to distri@@ bute all these forces , who lab@@ s in the fruit in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear them &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time he k@@ ills the fri@@ day , every day .
the door opens .
I always was convinced that black colour of the cor@@ ruption is , until I saw the yellow light , which gave us the hor@@ ror in the person : the Ra@@ ad ( approximately : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; play@@ through on the 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
in order to protect the un@@ certain@@ ty : to protect the state security in front of us , they speak the betra@@ yers and terror@@ ists in us , they speak to the al@@ a@@ wit@@ dic dial@@ ect - therefore they played the narrow perspective of their world view .
this is not a house there is no country . it is a curse to call them co@@ existence to trans@@ form the crime of their cl@@ ans in a her@@ oes .
I entered the hearing space and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and cris@@ y man ; at least he comes so on .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; con@@ vers@@ ational , despite the face of view that moving to him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can claim as a lot of important thing with your life and demonstr@@ ating these meetings that will soon be found anyway . &quot;
I don &apos;t answered .
I have p@@ amp@@ ered it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t tell more precisely when loading and stro@@ kes in a friendly conversation for me to have become a usual communication tool .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to be re@@ conc@@ iled to be pun@@ ished , even though I had done nothing to make this pun@@ ishment .
pun@@ ishment in all its diversity .
its command is to ri@@ p me as much as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably dates back to the clo@@ aks .
your H@@ enk@@ er gives herself to your cry .
give it a pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him and you can &apos;t keep your fear .
my Schre@@ ie lik@@ ed him not enough , so they re@@ plac@@ ements the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked about whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a gar@@ bage burning or whether it belonged to normal operation .
they had four cables connected to each other , to present us from their sight , great in@@ vention of a giant cable .
within a single hour , three of them , while I still was still in the range .
I lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , why I heard in writing .
the H@@ enk@@ er saw the cooling and found no pleasure in all , why it was a neigh@@ bour for a electric charged rod .
electricity flow through my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter .
my hal@@ ved body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect stream head .
the do@@ ck@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was back .
after two hor@@ ri@@ ble hours he decided that he had filled his duties for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to put me back again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
some hours of forget that happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens , and the morning light ful@@ f@@ ils the room &quot; .@@ R@@ as with you , Ass@@ f@@ ick@@ er . &quot;
I answer with the voice of a exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; my lord , my father must make fe@@ ar@@ able wor@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; be silent and walk you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had been released me .

the photo was taken by A@@ man Ma@@ dan , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib brings the most of his time . he sn@@ ared out to his screen once again to his computer , go and again at his couch .
but what can be left , you can discover a cigarette between his fing@@ ers or his fing@@ ers with nic@@ ot@@ ine spot@@ ted lips .
he is living in the upper floor of his family house which had been heard since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank , and lived in Palestine from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Farmer ) .
for more than six years , H@@ da@@ ib has been a pas@@ sion@@ ate activ@@ ist that the conservative majority are mut@@ tered and their alt@@ ell@@ ent opinion about LE@@ CH@@ TER@@ RO@@ LL@@ EN , sexu@@ ality and free Mein@@ ungs@@ an@@ agement through art and r@@ ape .
with his music , which is often replaced with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian Ge@@ ow@@ ers . all these them@@ es will not only find in his native city of Amman , but also in cities where Damascus had enough to grow up to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib sees itself as a som@@ eb@@ ody that is not limited by bound@@ aries , and he can feel the people with people to suffer from foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it is not open to it , he ab@@ bing a special down@@ turn against US American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ ib considered his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded from the author .
H@@ da@@ ib believes not that his co @-@ feeling for those who are trying to do in war zones that he was trying to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Ge@@ ush@@ ers of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan , and so far in Palestine was never before .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own living environment , &quot; st@@ ressed H@@ da@@ ib .
then add it to : &quot; I think so because I am a man , while it sp@@ ends in the waters of N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the Holy month Ram@@ a@@ dan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , sunrise to sunset .
in addition to the Jord@@ anian law says that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ a@@ dan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ ib took a certain weak@@ ness to break with ancient traditions . on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag is little with protest against Islam .
in principle , the bul@@ ls of loud coffee and the weak@@ ness of Kent @-@ cigarette smoke in the first line of freedom .
sometimes the Jordan fe@@ els like a prison in free of heaven , especially when you throw a look into the neighbour@@ ing countries .
of this , it avo@@ ids easily to do basic things - like to drink the public in the Ram@@ a@@ dan water - to land not in prison .
recently , the Interior Minister Jord@@ ani@@ ens has said one appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Le@@ ila , already for the second time .
some par@@ li@@ aments that support the Islamic Emirate - arg@@ um@@ ented the Islamic orientation of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - arg@@ um@@ ented that the sexual orientation of hom@@ osex@@ ual Fron@@ ts@@ ar@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dic@@ ted the cultural and traditional standards of the country , and the main reason for the concerts .
dep@@ uty and former press spokes@@ person in the Islamic co@@ alition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert has been cancelled &quot; because of sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ ers .
many claim , the commitment of the band in mat@@ ters like the Arab Spring , Human Rights and free Mein@@ ungs@@ gesellschaft in the Arab world , has end@@ ang@@ ible ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m that represents the old leg@@ itim@@ acy of aut@@ or@@ itative regime in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive destruction of human rights , &quot; which continue to continue to use a intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply sil@@ ky r@@ het@@ or@@ ic , but actually an important crystal @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan ir@@ resist@@ ances that occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib experienced gen@@ ital gen@@ italia killing his vision by the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ it@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously unknown woman , whose arms and legs are stret@@ ching up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of count@@ less women who lost their lives by the hands of those who should actually trust .
over the past years , the number of &quot; Hon@@ mor@@ de &apos; increased the number of Hon@@ our &quot; in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ our during the year 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan was missing that Jordan has become the institu@@ tional infrastructure to support women who tried to assist victims of public or domestic violence .
according to a law on bre@@ ach control from the year 1954 , women who have been exposed to the danger of comp@@ o@@ unding violence , &quot; and for their release is often a lon@@ gl@@ anger bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic effort , as well as the warranty of the family needed , that the woman will happen nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music is great popular@@ ity and is known for this , also not before subjects that are in his country long as tab@@ u .
H@@ da@@ ib found that his work is polit@@ ically , however , he sp@@ ati@@ es his music that is full of explic@@ it@@ ly appe@@ arances in sexu@@ ality , freedom and Mein@@ ungs@@ extern@@ ally , not by politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
in me , politics was troubled , &quot; says he .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ ib took the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are polit@@ ically isolated in the core .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ ib published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
the song was repeated in this song :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it too . &quot;
in another course of the songs , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , at which one can get , in his words , &quot; what I want &quot; - be it or not believe , h@@ eter@@ o- or hom@@ osexu@@ ality .
it not@@ ices that any someone has been talking about the rights of sw@@ allow and les@@ bian , and that comments concerning the equ@@ ation of LG@@ BT + -@@ individuals still in 2014 were stri@@ pped .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online programme Ro@@ ya to mer@@ it that his comments made from the context of the context , revol@@ ving and his opinion .
&quot; on You@@ tube it was up@@ loaded on You@@ tube , but was only a modified version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ ib open for the Arabic LG@@ BT + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is not of hom@@ osexu@@ als against Islam .
it is mentioned in Abu Nu@@ de , a po@@ ets of the eighth century still has remained in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ er@@ otic po@@ ems .
H@@ da@@ ib asks : if Abu Nu@@ de , who was able to work once on the order of Kal@@ if@@ en , in the eighth century open to hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can &apos;t it be Jord@@ i ?
the real problem , then H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian Kingdom , there is nothing more to re@@ alize that the government attacks on free Mein@@ ungs@@ add@@ ressing and the progressive vote will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian telec@@ omm@@ unications service took several former government representatives and members of the teacher , who had become critical to the comments in social media , which were related to comments using deep in the country .
in view of what is the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs only the top of the Eis@@ berg - the real challenge is to work , structural change in the next generation of Jordan .
for him , progress is a permanent building and pleasant . Jordan has become a gig in a row , but the way of progress - it looks at slow , well @-@ thought and comp@@ as@@ ible changes . it is sure that this changes of day is held in the heart of the Jord@@ anian Society .
finally , H@@ da@@ ib was finally dre@@ amed as millions of others , but of a Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he dre@@ amed not only to bring his work up to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; them . &quot;
there is perhaps the region using music , art and literature of a real and basic op@@ enn@@ ess - and not by bom@@ bs , scatter itions and an artificial type of dem@@ ocrac@@ ies . at least he h@@ opes it .
until the time is far , H@@ da@@ ib is far @-@ wide and therefore also aff@@ ord resistance .
this report was rep@@ aired by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Cris@@ is Rep@@ orting that A@@ man is called Fel@@ low as a student Fel@@ low .

rarely , outer appar@@ ition and body care as important as in this history , because they help to maintain the per@@ u@@ vian youth from the crime and maintain a leg@@ itim@@ ate prof@@ ession as the hair@@ style .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug market .
in April 2017 , a survey showed that 5@@ 1,5 percent of the population could not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus the unusual hair@@ style of famous sports scientists such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Art@@ uro V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Peru ) , has to re@@ alize that more Normal@@ ities into the experienced hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers , which can make this man@@ eu@@ p hair@@ style .
the exceptional demand for hair@@ style , which go to the outer edge of the fant@@ asy and cre@@ ativity , even has an annual event inspired , the competition of hair@@ dress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts each other to show that those who can see the ec@@ cent@@ ric Loo@@ ks as you can see in the following video ( more videos for current compet@@ itions , there are other videos on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational facilities such as the Augusto Salazar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to con@@ vin@@ ce young people to con@@ vin@@ ce their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice , who allows them to find work in the hair@@ dressing art that allows you to find work .

Colombia : love letters to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ eholders

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love Message to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ figh@@ ters &quot; to publish the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
this entry is published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices partnership .
why do we write only love letters to people who know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel out to feel aff@@ ection ?
this question was exactly this question the two young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation is not out of the head and inspired them to write the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ c@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to re@@ conc@@ iliation ) that young people ex@@ h@@ orted to write gu@@ err@@ illa &apos;s letters .
only recently , her country was a historic event , and they wanted to contri@@ bute to their part : after the years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with gu@@ err@@ illa armed forces F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces live in Latin America ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International is the signing of the peace agreement as much as that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos was awarded for its involvement in the Nobel Peace Prize .
however , the column is still a long way , until one can speak of a real re@@ conc@@ iliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ figh@@ ters who lived for many years in illegal camps , and around the clock their weapons at themselves , have to integ@@ rate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company again , which had used to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hat@@ red against gu@@ err@@ ill@@ aries , it must record in their rows and supporting the structure of a new life .
Leonardo and c@@ rist@@ ian were convinced that the young ge@@ ck@@ ers have to close together and help the integration process .
and just that they did so : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa figh@@ ters to welcome them again in the company .
the aim of campaign are 69@@ 00 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa figh@@ ters - which should be handed in to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as in@@ spiration for Camp@@ aign
the idea for the letters to re@@ conc@@ iliation was held at the World Summit in Bog@@ ot@@ á , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and c@@ rist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people that we love to write to thousands of love letters , but those who need to need a lot of needed .
he plane , he told him to share his love with people who needed at the most urg@@ ent additions .
thus , the Plan , letters full of hope and support for the former figh@@ ters of the F@@ ARC to write their place in society and have to be a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a joint history of peace &quot; say they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all larger cities such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never have thought that someone would be for@@ given me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region in the Cal@@ don@@ o region .
a group of 40 students , University of J@@ aver@@ iana , Cal@@ i , two members of the Municipal administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art travelled to the camp to deliver the letters in person .
the members of the F@@ ARC were so on how they had done before to order the commands of their leader .
but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters full of sub @-@ protected people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all shar@@ ks . &quot; it &apos;s un@@ belie@@ vable how many different fe@@ el@@ ings can occur in just a few hours - from an@@ xi@@ ety down to happ@@ iness and everything that is between , &quot; told the policy student Manuela J@@ im@@ éne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff of the governor of the Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after having handed out the letters , a former fighter caused me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa figh@@ ters .
when I was living in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ err@@ ill@@ aries live ) saw I saw a gu@@ err@@ illas that wrote something .
I had afraid to go , because next to the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer &apos; , a f@@ atal weapon in a thorn .
I said to him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing now ? &quot; he said , &quot; I answer you in a letter that someone has written me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life , someone has something that is written , therefore answer me . &quot; there was suddenly the te@@ ars about the che@@ eks . &quot;
I enjoyed him very firm , and restored me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer .
perhaps he was also the war , it was sorry to be all the years of faith@@ fulness of this fighter and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life as war . under the F@@ ARC , the only possibility to keep him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never have thought that someone would be for@@ given me for my error .
but now I know that there is a society with open poor to us there .
until now I have learned only how I need to walk with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ n@@ ity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
for the kick @-@ off , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion group .
the students had grown up all over the war , and the F@@ ARC already lived in the bor@@ ough .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC has seen the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and issued in@@ sight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced the opportunity to develop us to create a political party , we can contri@@ bute to us to create the society in this country .
for a aim of this size , it is worth to overcome all obst@@ acles , &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was im@@ pressed :
these people were listening to hear so far never hearing had found , and to recogn@@ ise that people who had often seen often than mon@@ sters , and even had only people with beautiful po@@ ems that were turned through their living environment and their environment was very pain@@ ful for me .
the reality that lives in the country , is sorry for me .
but it is com@@ for@@ ted that all men - even those who have killed and so much har@@ m have to bring us something and a smile .
many former figh@@ ters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the column was rep@@ ain@@ ted that they would rule peace after the dis@@ arm@@ ament of peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is in@@ equality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there is always people who are ready to attack the weapons , and they are completely just@@ ified . and this is also completely just@@ ified ( ... ) .
we take place from the F@@ ARC now on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that &apos;s why we call all the defense of peace on - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology , they hear about all those that are dre@@ aming of a country in the war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution , and sacrifice , because we know from my own experience that nothing is simple . those under us who def@@ end life as the basis of the existence , many difficulties are coming .
on our way there will be many obst@@ acles , but we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ ac@@ sum@@ ova and its first published on the OC Media website .
hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed in a wide range of d@@ ang@@ ers - including dis@@ cri@@ mination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ pressing .
in terror , activ@@ ists have experienced the reporting of the last months over the per@@ secution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which was based like a dam@@ cl@@ onal file over the dor@@ ci@@ ous LG@@ BT community , is not only produced over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual wife from Gros@@ ny , who informed us some of their experiences with us , and told us what has happened in the Republic .
LG@@ BT Legal Situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports were published that the to@@ wing , torture and killing of que@@ er males in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ised .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light to the methods of the ch@@ urch@@ war@@ den authorities , the dam@@ p men and they took place in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was in reality a woman since her childhood .
she was aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she went to Moscow .
after a group Ch@@ ech@@ ens were experienced by gender equality in their country @-@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sabrina .
her life went out of fear of her life in the USA .
Sabrina : I was active as a volunte@@ er hel@@ per during a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that a man needed my help .
it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , an transition to trouble in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itate .
while I tried to help her , someone made a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the Internet , with my phone number and a picture from me . he gives them no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can be elim@@ inated this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents caused by quite Wh@@ ats@@ app the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I just returned to fet@@ ch some shopping m@@ ills from the back seat of my cars , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt anything in my body , but I did nothing .
then I heard a set , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you escape the family , you sc@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot;
I knew not the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consci@@ ousness and a@@ wo@@ ke last du@@ des in the hospital .
appar@@ ently , some women had to get away and started writing .
the man fled .
the women had a am@@ bul@@ ance .
in the hospital I knew that I had two j@@ uris@@ diction in my right lung bu@@ ck@@ wing .
OC Media : in which pot@@ ash wings were laid out - in the men or the women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name ; but the doctor stood up and laid me in the women .
for that , I am very gr@@ ate@@ ful for him .
when I read his name for the first time at his offices , I got to do it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned himself as good man .
I &apos;m th@@ ank@@ ful to him that he is respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they sm@@ ell me , wrote me - relative , stran@@ ger , and some un@@ known .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neigh@@ bo@@ urs and some dist@@ ant relations .
the desired , to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie .
they set ab@@ sur@@ de claims : some told me that I will prove it by the streets ; others wanted to say that I was not changed in the official television in grand@@ ny and say that I was not changed my sex , and Phot@@ oshop only .
I have a cup size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how does your family try to t@@ ack@@ le this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some el@@ derly people said to be my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world , not only your family , but the entire republic .
we don &apos;t touch you , because you are a good woman , but you must dis@@ appear here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she lay down a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neigh@@ bo@@ urs came and rescue them .
at the time I had to change several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and just a few hours later , under the window a car with dark@@ ened window discs and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ auf .
after it happened for the third time I was clear that there was something f@@ au@@ l .
my human rights activ@@ ists exam@@ ines the number plates - it turned out that I was per@@ sec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activ@@ ists .
for safety reasons I will not give their names , but I will say that I have all rec@@ all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belie@@ ving .
I can &apos;t even re@@ alize how it could be .
shortly before my departure , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it , without notice , without ID , without any thing .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I connected the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother per Wh@@ ats@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you believe not about , you war@@ st in safety because you for@@ got the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you think . you know even your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : you are in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , but this is a tobacco ema .
some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements are I still in me .
so very much I wish it , this se@@ el@@ ian barrier can &apos;t be overcome .
I always say that , while my mother is alive , I will do my best to destroy them .
if we ch@@ ise with camera , I give me a bit of trouble , as the person is remin@@ is@@ cent of her past , so on my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current location in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do we have remained ?
Sabrina : I was submitted a report in Washington on one week .
for the used I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone to eat the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that while Ram@@ a@@ dan had been arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of the Ram@@ a@@ dan could hardly wait , and he completed a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and rel@@ atives .
so that my I invite you to un@@ load the rel@@ atives before , these may take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end , a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood co@@ ve experience .
OC Media : are now even we@@ alth@@ y men in these secre@@ ts being held ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says , there wer@@ en &apos;t be very many .
if , then all these that have no rich rel@@ atives or those of their rel@@ atives have been en@@ rolled in order to make the Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s dish .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so they can present it later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim it in some village or a military base point .
do you understand ?
as if these people are not simply disappeared , but targeted to achieve a radi@@ cal .
OC Media : is that now only a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I went straight to someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun in a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard was growing .
there has been nothing new from them .
they simply have taken them .
and so , Lord , this person was involved in this way as these people were taken away .
until now they were not released as Band@@ ites , but there were yet no reports yet . we were avo@@ ided to that such actions are possible .
why would you not allow this man to sh@@ ave these people ?
do you know if this per@@ secu@@ tions and demonstr@@ ations of people who was a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sabrina : I &apos;ve got my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in the Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria had never had problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was more saf@@ er than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; civ@@ il@@ ization &quot; , but ulti@@ mat@@ ely returned to the stone .
OC Media : how is it possible by the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ row were off@@ ended ; I had colored eyelashes , w@@ ished tubes and short f@@ tops .
even the security Ministry of Sh@@ aria has never made me a hair curved .
before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood still , and all the city knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never s@@ worn .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a re@@ use : Khar@@ k@@ ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte is not far beyond the disaster of another . &quot;
it often says about children when they make a sick fun .
OC Media : so they simply turned their eyes before you , because they believed , you are sick ?
Sabrina : Yes .
they never sm@@ ote me , never f@@ aint , and never sm@@ itten him . &quot;
OC Media : how long does this grace rise in time ?
Sabrina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 he began to talk about Mor@@ al in television .
he said not to us per se , but forward to the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , you could feel the people who began to change people in the city .
those who stood before , and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with a sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the period I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I couldn &apos;t feel like the situation in the Republic .
OC Media : what activity go to now ?
Sabrina : I am working as a winery .
I don &apos;t have much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
I saw that I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
at present I have been responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ates with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize tea re@@ ef , meeting , I &apos;m offering them to the hospital , hel@@ ping them to get food types .
I lost none cent .
I discovered these people as I have a refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : apply a Hid@@ ing to you ?
Sabrina : this is the hosts .
so , the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as the Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no weak@@ ening at them .
the Dag@@ est@@ ans have those who have the cables have you who have the Rus@@ sians also ; in the whole planet , they are not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is not pleas@@ antly to listen to it .
I meet here so many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - pract@@ ising Muslims who go into the mos@@ que and in the Ram@@ a@@ dan rock - live together with men .
know , many think of Tran@@ sid@@ ental in men who love men , and they believe that you changes his sex to make more in@@ timate experiences . but that &apos;s a tr@@ ug@@ ging .
that are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ations to be exact , different quality of life settings .
for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and har@@ m me for my body .
not , if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I may be personally personally , but my last in@@ timate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad , because I know that I am now myself .

the burning of a man called Jas@@ si@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the situation of the situation of the Arab Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i @-@ Community in Iran , influ@@ enced by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Th@@ aw@@ ra in the Sou@@ thwest of the I@@ rans in the South West of Iran .
he suffered under Ang@@ st@@ ress@@ ors , Dep@@ ression and he sh@@ amed for his own Hil@@ de@@ viation , the in@@ ability to come to his family , Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups that work in Ah@@ wa@@ z , and anon@@ ymous .
a YouTube @-@ shared video held the mom@@ ents after he had agreed to himself .
some people made it fast to remove the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was put into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the combust@@ ion were so strong that doctors could not do any more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide in August , within the Arab Ah@@ mad @-@ min@@ ority , activ@@ ist activ@@ ists before being there that even more men could take care of life .
the Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that these month have some other - Ham@@ id Man@@ i@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mo@@ uss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hung .
their stories will have one thing together : there were all family v@@ aged who fe@@ eds themselves because of the per@@ secution of the I@@ ran@@ ian government , help and un@@ able to feed their families and a secure work .
Arab Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i suffer poverty , unemployment and dis@@ cri@@ mination
the region , which is a large part of Iran &apos;s living Arab Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i community , has been killed by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to maintain their hab@@ itation of local Arab population .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z took over a mainly aut@@ onomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took power and took over in 1925 great effort to end ethnic aut@@ onomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran next oil and gas fields as well as some of the most portable and valuable commercial areas for I@@ ran@@ ian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to remain slowly , and the local population gets just little from this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and kid@@ neys .
the I@@ ran@@ ian regime refused to adop@@ t the Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s system@@ atically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of dem@@ ons built into the Per@@ sian areas in the Per@@ sian territ@@ ories , where the provinces was Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m .
these dem@@ ns have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation of destruction in the region , and the local agriculture , as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry .
unemployment rate under the Arab Ah@@ aw@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the I@@ ran@@ ian General Director for co@@ operative , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ v@@ az@@ is that completed a work , completed the elem@@ entary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; system@@ atic strategy ... which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ imi , an I@@ ran@@ ian Ah@@ az@@ i @-@ Human Rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ial ethnic dis@@ cri@@ mination , &quot; a &quot; high rise &quot; of su@@ mor@@ den under the young Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
Doh@@ imi said that especially the unemployment has become worse and worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z newly @-@ coming ethnic group and an anti @-@ Arab dis@@ cri@@ mination in the setting process :
since function and institutions prefer non @-@ Arabic workers , the local Arab Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i will have access to business opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of a system@@ atic policy of the rul@@ ing reg@@ imes which aims to destroy the spirit of national an@@ cip@@ ality of young Ar@@ aber , and they will earn their hab@@ itation outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their first@@ fruits and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i , as well as Arabic names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because the speaking of Arab language , or the mo@@ ist Arab clothing .
in view of the given circumstances which , the Arab Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i have to carry out human rights activ@@ ists , before the situation explo@@ si@@ ves .
it remains silence , whether the world will wake up , and of it knowledge .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated de@@ pression .
de@@ pression is treated and su@@ icide is avo@@ ided .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the position that was posted by Ay@@ om@@ ide Z@@ uri and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject of several discussions that many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am no Fem@@ in@@ ist@@ in , many women re@@ act in particular white women to record themselves as a sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fr@@ ust .
they w@@ ander , why I am not part of the movement .
they even raised scientific and social arg@@ uments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ized * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men , despite the same education .
however , women still have under str@@ enger ob@@ serv@@ ations when it &apos;s about to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidem@@ ic .
or that cultural and social standards are still attri@@ but@@ able to ensure women or later in various areas of life to a smooth cover , and dis@@ cri@@ mination based on gender equality still across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware and known .
I &apos;m convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women , black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q congregation , or black women from the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; when I had to mention , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , dis@@ connect many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
however , all of them that women should come together to get women - all women - come together to sing &quot; their voices and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to reach the equality ( some ) of women .
however , they don &apos;t want to talk about sexual violence in addition to sexual motiv@@ ated violence that we are subject to black women on two times .
or in addition , black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and Her@@ c@@ commodation price less des@@ erve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls are trained with a migration background more often than white girls , due to ob@@ vious integration process .
or that women in black sp@@ ar and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , than white women .
in one way , I want all women , all males and all men each man have any skin color ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t consider ourselves as a black woman , who refused to take effect on both gender as well as on the skin of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and I &apos;m not going to battle my refuge in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented Sp@@ h@@ äre , which me and count@@ less black women always has rejected .
in 1851 , So@@ jo@@ ur@@ ner did his speech in their speech : &quot; I am no wife ? &quot; and I also ref@@ use me to maintain a ide@@ ology at the black woman in a historic view of a simple and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature .
I ref@@ use me to join me in addition to cultural incl@@ ines our customs and customs service to pres@@ cri@@ bed their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will not try to bear white women the importance of skin color and gender quot@@ ation . for some of them will continue to kill the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to do it .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional Fem@@ in@@ ism was formed in order to spend a home of different origin and ren@@ ounces away from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; Fem@@ in@@ ism &quot; is still in his name .
I go before , fully release me full and completely from Fem@@ in@@ ism , to put my coat for my dark skin and my status as wife , instead of me for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , which is so tough , that Inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenom@@ enon .
now it is more important than ever before we define the black women after our own performances and give us to the Sp@@ här@@ en@@ ary , which are created by us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the Bu@@ ches Afri@@ cana Th@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can def@@ end ourselves through our own kind , and not only the - black women can be converted to this way , in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ el@@ ian , physical and even spiritual elements can be found , which make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately shall be called separ@@ at@@ ism and excl@@ usion , after they have read these lines , please inform them about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this Para@@ dig@@ m existed .
I will be recognized due to my dark skin and because of my D@@ as@@ one as part of this Para@@ dig@@ mas .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in a environment where my life has neither exceeded , still ig@@ no@@ red .

Par@@ agu@@ ay Women and her difficult struggle against violence

the following article is the short@@ ened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Par@@ agu@@ ay , &quot; by Kur@@ z . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # her@@ ich@@ ein@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ am ) , who talked about the forest @-@ over against women in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
most names were changed to protect the affected people .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ vez said that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , who had become a partner that had become active in comparison to a violent , company .
since the end of their relationship had something time , and the police said , her statement would be laid on the ac@@ ute , but more could not do .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was shown for mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , you also benef@@ ited the ad@@ mon@@ ary display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ vez .
a few days later , the second wife moved back to her ad .
violence against women break against women , is difficult .
if women appear at all once , they will not receive any support at the State Court .
in many cases , women have also dependent the financial assets of men , which they mis@@ use . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence to be at all in the pro@@ secution of pro@@ secution .
content and Statist@@ ics and Statist@@ ics 2 In@@ visible mis@@ use and legal system that nothing under@@ sh@@ imm@@ t@@ 3 Par@@ agu@@ ay laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics
it &apos;s hard to be found such as many women really ab@@ use , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , Resear@@ cher for gen@@ e@@ ys on Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institu@@ tion in Par@@ agu@@ ay . &quot; there are different information and reports , but not even ans@@ wering the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Par@@ agu@@ ay , explains them .
the numbers available are al@@ arm@@ ing .
in 2015 at the District Court of Pro@@ secution 9@@ 600 publ@@ ishers for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of advertis@@ ements in the police came by women .
there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace of peace . 86 % of all women come from women .
in the advertis@@ ements 40 % of women that they were har@@ ass@@ ed physical ab@@ use , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mis@@ use .
however , these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi will appear only a few of these offen@@ ders . &quot; on every woman who will be ref@@ unded in Par@@ agu@@ ay because of mental ab@@ use , 9 women who do not do this .
for each woman who ref@@ unded to physical mis@@ use , come two women who do not do , declared it at the end of 2014 .
because women &apos;s su@@ icide in Par@@ agu@@ ay is not a personal off@@ ense , the pro@@ secution will not be noted , as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
up to August 2016 , journalists spent at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
coordin@@ ator for human rights in Par@@ agu@@ ay , documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
after their estimates , in Par@@ agu@@ ay , every ten days a woman dies a woman due to violent actions .

invisible mis@@ use and a legal system , which under@@ takes nothing
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , it &apos;s in@@ sist@@ ed that she called his name of all their former friends .
at the beginning they didn &apos;t wanted to do this , but after that . this should be for ever .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but for two years the psych@@ ological force took part in one of the most common forms of violence against women , and at the same time the most severe :
I never have thought that I would have been victims of ab@@ use .
if I have read before it , I thought that that just happens women to be sub@@ mar@@ inated because they are violent in violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mariana arranged social media to report about the mist@@ re@@ ation by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions to Facebook , where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told them how he had isolated .
many people said to their contributions , including Carlos even . he asked if he had raised the hand against them , and refused to be ad@@ vised that his behaviour was also a form of ab@@ use .
other Facebook users asked Mariana , why did they leave the so long of Carlos , and left him not before .
it seemed almost so , they wanted to say that victims of ab@@ use had to have a certain co @-@ school .
Victoria Santos , who were not born in Par@@ agu@@ ay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Par@@ agu@@ ay in order to prove their former partner .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you , &quot; ) that consists of women , all in any sort of ab@@ use of Mis@@ use .
in the group they can talk with other than their experience , listening to one another and support each other .
you do that which many other do not do : they will take the end to the women .
in Vic@@ tori@@ as case , everything began with mental ab@@ use .
her we@@ alth@@ y partner finally managed to con@@ vin@@ ce them that it was valuable .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tori@@ as displays the authorities remained without the results and also of their rel@@ atives , they received no support .
she led a trial against their former partner , which developed into an un@@ break@@ through legal struggle between Par@@ agu@@ ay and her home country , in which it was primarily by money , power and influence of their former Partners .
Par@@ agu@@ ay laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Par@@ agu@@ ay there are many laws that are very good but not applied .
the ab@@ use of ab@@ use is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against cor@@ ruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ aur@@ i , an representative of the UN organization for women in Par@@ agu@@ ay , also looks great problems with the use of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Less . ) are part of a campaign on Twitter using the Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original draft of the law sees Fem@@ dom@@ id to explain to a stand@@ alone off@@ ences and har@@ dening as it is already in neighbour@@ ing countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature was changed in some points to win the members of the law , that the way for dis@@ cri@@ min@@ alization of abor@@ tions , the current in Par@@ agu@@ ay is bas@@ ically prohib@@ ited and pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had provided , most of the ( bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process costs which have to bear the victims of violence even though they simply have to receive only display and secure accommodation , to the state .
Ech@@ aur@@ i arg@@ um@@ ented that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature doesn &apos;t have sufficient financial resources for this :
in Par@@ agu@@ ay , Mis@@ use is seen as a part of a human relation@@ ships .
here , there must be a change that violence is not more than a somewhat lower part .
who is going to be found in view of these facts and contri@@ butes to that the per@@ pet@@ rators are coming .
we must pay for a long display , until ab@@ use is no longer regarded as normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted by the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law was changed , amongst other things a passage was cancelled , which had been established in cases of domestic violence to re@@ conc@@ iliation .
the opinions on changes go to each other .
the section of re@@ conc@@ iliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ g@@ ress@@ or his vic@@ tim to attack his victims .
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman has suspended a year after prohib@@ ition of a newspaper .
&quot; this website has been closed due to a decision of the information of the Information Office , &quot; we refer to the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the Korean authorities have closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting on cor@@ ruption in the sult@@ an@@ ate .

on 8 January , the Minister of Information for an order , which extended the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister for Finance , personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; has been extended to three additional months , and the Minister for another time against the decision of the App@@ eals Court introduced the publication of the newspaper .
the and@@ au@@ ern@@ de closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only time to viol@@ ate the Press Freedom in Oman in Oman .
for further inju@@ ries , for example , the closure of the independent magazine Mo@@ wat@@ ched and the ex@@ termination of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country , to put their operation .
due to the closing ceremony of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an@@ ic authorities are still not ready to prepare an extensive viol@@ ation of the Press Freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls the om@@ an authorities on :

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ ite War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , shown with his understanding
medical research in Africa becomes extremely rare or even mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that is addressed to one of the most urg@@ ent need of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need of medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of global health care , many medicines and vacc@@ ines required to cover the special medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have widespread in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa far more gra@@ ving effects than ander@@ sw@@ o , and lack investments for the research of these diseases are a big problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists have been carried out in Africa . a major role of science and technology can be hand@@ led for the economic growth of the continent only .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for research of inf@@ ecti@@ ous disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ecti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s at Lus@@ aka , Zambia just than the AIDS epidem@@ ic first gra@@ ft effects on national health .
he left Zambia in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he worked on the HIV @-@ virus , before he decided to go home back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ understanding of the media on this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research assignment ?
Ran@@ j@@ ite War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I supp@@ os@@ ing the sam@@ b@@ ische national programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laborat@@ ories .
in addition , I just launch a research program for development of molecular genetic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pat@@ ho@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion about the important scientists in your country and general in Africa ?
how do they di@@ ffer from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research for basic research . we just put solutions for what it has been developed differ@@ ently .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers , rather than to be ma@@ cher .
the solutions that we get , are often not usable in our neighbour@@ hood , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where is the financing and support ?
is it enough ?
how easy or difficult , it is suitable to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differ@@ ently well .
it &apos;s difficult to find people to return or come here , because the financing and development chan@@ ces are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obst@@ acles there are in your routine research , which you haven &apos;t had before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure is not equal to the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it will take months to import from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interested but only a very limited understanding of science methods .
I would pro@@ pose that critical thinking and scientific methods must be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how large is your mind after the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on how and how can we support the development ?
RW : the Potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is demand in special scientific education , starting in every age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , expl@@ oring the world &apos;s health ( non @-@ transmitted diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine are very benef@@ ic@@ ial .
G@@ V : you can describe the pro@@ s and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is limited to do things , and access to scientific expertise , which represent the challenges here .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the United States to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; Subst@@ ances will change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which is reported about solv@@ ents for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on bre@@ d in the USA in the USA in the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ lining , the first plant which has been built by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been hon@@ oured .
for almost 20 years of work , Mort@@ ons had been doing just through its own dis@@ infection and the question as many sal@@ ads who can get the bound@@ aries .
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he felt that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to bre@@ d more for breeding .
the pat@@ ents are not only available for single varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or green leaves .
over the last years , more such pat@@ ents have been applied to more plants such as cer@@ eal or ti@@ fleet types . due to this trends , plant breeding and non@@ fiction for food security ensure the future of food production .
Mort@@ on , as a pas@@ sion@@ ate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still needs to salad , but it needs longer than ever since his work is still more restri@@ ctions .
&quot; it is , when I lie in a river a rock@@ y rock in order to sett@@ le the sk@@ ull .
so we have to move it now , but it is a fr@@ action with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think this pat@@ ents are too far too far .
and when they stand before the court , no one can bre@@ d more than a new sal@@ ads because all features are patented . &quot; he makes so well as possible and temp@@ ted to ri@@ fy those features that he wants .
however , it is very careful and hard to use , no material is being protected as a intel@@ lec@@ tual property .
in addition , it is also connected to a movement that is always in the USA and everywhere in the world , Open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eds ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS , red Roman salad of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ama in the &quot; Green@@ house &quot; station is bre@@ d and eaten . there will be tested , whether plants can be built in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name is rather than sounds , than the movement origin@@ ate from the IT area and not from the range of plants .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides altern@@ atives to ur@@ rec@@ t @-@ protected software .
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intel@@ lec@@ tual property and so for veget@@ arian use .
as part of the initiative , just OSS@@ I , we can oblig@@ ate US bre@@ e@@ ders to use that others may be able to use ch@@ at@@ ted Sa@@ at@@ gut free of them .
this does not mean that they can do not continue with their seeds and can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder can only buy others to cross it , and it is not immediately appe@@ aring - two aspects that are b@@ anned by many plant pat@@ ents .
do@@ zens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
d@@ üst@@ ere out@@ look
in the emer@@ itus of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Mad@@ ison and OSS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to bre@@ d new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
it is well @-@ related to him a role in larger problems such as bi@@ odi@@ versity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ e@@ ders would try to use the latter not or just little bit by using seed resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ ressed that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement doesn &apos;t work with gen@@ et@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ched , whether vegetables , grain , gen@@ et@@ ically , or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological projects , such as it is aimed at pe@@ as@@ ant markets , such as it is cultiv@@ ated to pe@@ as@@ ant markets , such as this vegetables is cultiv@@ ated , threatened .
nutritional so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty without seed so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative is oblig@@ atory to provide other its seed @-@ well @-@ free . thus , their provision is in contrast to it , seeds and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Unter@@ st@@ üt@@ zer arg@@ um@@ ble that the future of food supplies end@@ anger , since the available Gen@@ pool is due to increasingly available spiritual property rights , which is therefore increasingly available , un@@ abl@@ ily del@@ igh@@ ted .
Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of OSS@@ I , has a doc@@ torate in her doc@@ toral thesis in carrots and their availability . she found out that roughly a third of all ti@@ ring features is protected as a spiritual property , making it not usable for plant breeding either .
for other plants there are not such an estimated , but experts such as Lu@@ by gl@@ uten that mass@@ acres of cultiv@@ ation plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots .
a Quest@@ ion of Vis@@ ion@@ ist
plants are so bre@@ d that they are targeted - of such , due to their flavor or their colour impro@@ ves up to such , due to them in certain environments , such as sh@@ ackl@@ es or diseases .
opp@@ onents of pat@@ ents on plant properties reve@@ als that the available plant material for bre@@ eder over more pat@@ ents are currently being necessary than ever before , as the changed terms due to climate change have been fore@@ se@@ eable .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ inter@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto , indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also cru@@ cial for Mon@@ san@@ tos and collaboration with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States .
however , it is contra@@ dic@@ ted that intel@@ lec@@ tual property names , as &quot; pat@@ ents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ers innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is taken in the bas@@ ically a plan that can follow the patent as soon as the patent has expired .
often these statements will help with another method to come to the same result .
such kind of such protection is not that innovation , but promot@@ es them by using the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the other : 20 years waiting for a patent , certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to wait for plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one could have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources still has been a general good and still remains : &quot; independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ izers are not attractive for us .
we want to make landing your work easier .
that &apos;s it all , and it will be impossible to us if we don &apos;t want to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in all , Mort@@ on has imp@@ acted Mort@@ on to the concept , plant features : &quot; we created the characteristics not really self .
plants make it themselves out and as a bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea of doing what plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and OSS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ d a wor@@ th@@ ence , so also his own values are in them in .
those who believes in industrial agriculture with large fi@@ b@@ ors and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , her@@ b@@ icide , her@@ b@@ ulation can be bre@@ d into its varieties such concept by agriculture .
my concept is exactly ? .
while some medium businesses ( such , which move on international markets , but smaller than such as Mon@@ san@@ to ) pat@@ ents have to re@@ ject it , even without pat@@ ents , either re@@ ject it , or hold it for too expensive and therefore not wor@@ th@@ while or both is the case .
the independent plant @-@ resistant Frank Mort@@ on is looking for Sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ e@@ ders would be innovative by the avoid@@ ing of plant pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented .
I always need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my compet@@ itors are able to sell my varieties in a few years himself , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent for 20 years ago it is being protected from competition , where@@ with one of my opinion it really makes . &quot; worldwide Reson@@ ance
although the USA seem to be a breeding in the &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eder , but the concept sp@@ reads out quickly all over the world .
in India , the center for Sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable agriculture ) , which describes itself as professional organization in the resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program works with farmers work and helps them to provide new varieties that satis@@ fy certain requirements .
it also supports them , on &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut to come and sell their own .
the German Organisation has been working on a &quot; Open Source &quot; license which ulti@@ mat@@ ely finally became a formal and legal binding form of OSS@@ I oblig@@ ation for bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( regulations for the bre@@ eds di@@ ffer from country to country , so that the OSS@@ I Syndrome is not easy to use one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission announced that conventional plants could not be patented . thus , she speaks to the current practice of the European Patent am@@ ts , pat@@ ents on conventional plants .
a statement is still no law , but now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to put this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; conference facilities and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and conference companies from all East Africa to find something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; recovery motion and the global trend towards the spon@@ sor of Sa@@ at@@ os .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ credited systems that the organization is currently making a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed trade systems for the scheduled next year of the official grid .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international Non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group - Action Group on E@@ corrosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and bi@@ odi@@ versity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , global Alliance for the Future of Food , global Alliance for the future of Food - a compos@@ ite and from support organizations such as the WK Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and another - a report that farmers have to come to seed and improve the seed policy , making a stable power supply with food .
in the report also , the importance of a varied , local power supply with seeds for sustainable food systems are emphas@@ ised - a connection to recognize that by the Lu@@ by of OSS@@ I hope it will be able to see him more people .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods have played especially in particular , where and like something is being built , and Sa@@ at . &quot; we now try to know people that know more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and Blog are the latest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities in the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on weekend at the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government opened its website of the Arabic network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights viol@@ ations in Egypt as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network was published a statement on Facebook which critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic network for Human Rights Information , ab@@ sent to def@@ end in this part of the World and the Constitution in the Arab world , so it was not so difficult to overcome them to overcome all technical possibilities to overcome the pl@@ ying and don &apos;t hes@@ itate to ful@@ fill our task to ful@@ fill our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first @-@ called website of a human rights organisation into Egypt after the authorities block@@ ed more than two months of 21 websites as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar of Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web links to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the Columbus &amp; Human Rights Research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ dan .
Zi@@ dan uses his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of articles &amp; articles that he has not written for in Egypt on the web pages and the media .
well , the blog , which he established himself to perish at the Egyptian government , itself the aim of a attack .
b@@ logger , the provider of which also heated to Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , was arrested almost 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , during which he reported on the student of physical violence against two students .
his article are mainly due to politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment posted zi@@ ada with the government and reflec@@ ting what this means that this means :
the b@@ logs to un@@ locked is very old , but has not priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the pl@@ ump of b@@ logs may not be mean@@ ing@@ ful for the world , so it is for me for me :
1 ) It is managed to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege control ; an arrest , un@@ covered murder , pre @-@ charge of the national Security Council , the locking of b@@ logs as well as any other website , for whom I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I didn &apos;t understand otherwise . in other words , my words have influence , if also on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used to go to the position of articles to ren@@ ew the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have locked him locked , and they were afraid of words , I can still change the link or a second blog .
the mu@@ le go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) un@@ locked Egyptian government from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ der ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the formation of providers that was possible by the access of Internet access and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Net@@ works ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
on Monday , 12th of June , we noticed how the re@@ hear@@ ings of websites that offer V@@ PN@@ s .
a such practice indicates the inten@@ tion of government to block , continue to block content and fil@@ ing to access the Egyptian users .
the situation is in addition , the situation deci@@ des to be locked behind locked doors , thereby reducing the Egyptian population and no legal basis , by calling them against these actions .
now the question : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them as next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are disp@@ uted .

day for day reports newspapers in the Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home many post card motive .
some of this head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old &quot; shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ th@@ ie@@ ves Phar@@ m@@ acy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sen@@ ds 8500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air poll@@ ut@@ ants to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ang@@ esp@@ an financial situation , the blo@@ ody 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization , called Global Justice , called to inter@@ v@@ ene the United Nations .
reports such as these are all daily and this is in@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local paper .
so , the detailed report on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the Editorial article &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which it announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city will now be published there .
the pattern for her decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes reported in every big city on the world like murder , smoking , sexual off@@ spring , etc . everything that happens from civ@@ ilian standard and what is only in Rio &quot; war in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our kind to call : this is not normal .
this is the only alternative to return to journalists not our eyes as journalists .
in a 4 @-@ minute video that was divided on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Guedes , editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newspaper that this decision was no reason for pri@@ de , but rather a sign of the failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war@@ bri@@ y in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the paper was declared that the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro is 8@@ 43 territ@@ ories which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the Editorial article , the newspaper writes :
it is aware that a war of war when he is dist@@ orted , also it can be used , cru@@ el the police , which first shoot and then questions , to be destroyed .
but we def@@ end the war on information and the fight against cor@@ ruption in the police , whose goal is not the civ@@ ilian population , but the economic power of Maf@@ ia and their partners .
does the name &quot; War &quot; more than them be supported ?
in an article on the News portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il , the journalist in Cec@@ il Bras@@ il , the journalist developed as &quot; War &quot; as a just@@ ification of the failed security policy through the media and could be shot , responsible for calcul@@ ating the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of cor@@ ruption and poor planning - such as Extra by the analysis of the military @-@ interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ adequate investments in personnel , ins@@ ulating and an historic and self @-@ counter@@ f@@ ences of public services .
reminder : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , according to Cec@@ ília is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . this is the latest available data .
no one of these cities is in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look forward to the Mor@@ dr@@ ati in the state of the state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; it writes .
extra belongs to the company Glo@@ bo , the largest media enterprise South America , which is emphas@@ ised as Cec@@ ília , has repeated the security policy of the State .
to these certain@@ ty measures also belonged to U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Pac@@ ific@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio , whose purpose is to conqu@@ er a massive police station a Fav@@ ela and a unit permanently stored there .
at the beginning , this resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . for some years the U@@ PP had actually protected against sil@@ ic@@ ans and repres@@ sion against the poor communities that protect the ne@@ ug@@ al police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not equal to the population &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to just@@ ify questions , the classification of the Rio as the war is also severe consequences for human beings .
for this is called for the state , funds and paths , which are typical for a war . it belongs to the territory of a &quot; Fein@@ des &quot; at which a civ@@ ilian point in the landscape is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als damage &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ir@@ r@@ te bul@@ lets . &quot;

in a night in autumn 1994 , the conqu@@ est Afgh@@ ans started the T@@ ali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terri@@ ble civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a country of terror and des@@ pair .
exactly at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of Gh@@ az@@ ni in Central African , for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother said it then not so , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
during the morning , the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would take him away , and bring him to the s@@ ay@@ ings .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara domin@@ ate the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , was murdered by the T@@ ali@@ ban and had caught up many Haz@@ ara .
they always closer to Haz@@ ara known T@@ ali@@ ban on the haz@@ ara known T@@ ali@@ ban .
many Haz@@ ara leaving the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af was in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort . the work was difficult and made it sick .
then he took up what was left of its low wage , and went into Iran . once again he was in a strange country together with other refugees and to@@ wing saw with mort@@ ars who were heav@@ ier than he himself to make his living .
at that time , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees stamped by El@@ end and explo@@ itation in Iran .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af lived in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we worked also .
there was no goods and no heating . we hang@@ ed nylon from the open window , so we don &apos;t refresh@@ ed . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af sent his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
at the end@@ anger on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities denied its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , sle@@ pt in parks and went into a church that divided twice on the day of food .
it is true that Italy is due to relatively high performance quot@@ as for asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true , however , that the conditions that apply asylum seek@@ ers in the country , dis@@ ast@@ ers are dis@@ ast@@ rous .
the Human Rights Organisation , Liber@@ al Union for Europe , writes the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transpar@@ ency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is ho@@ used in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; it is impro@@ vised by impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be al@@ located to an recording center , if they have officially put an application for asylum , which can still go in after the registration of asylum .
until then , people who have no money for a accommodation , were either instruc@@ ted to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road .
so it took A@@ shar@@ af .
but his leg@@ itim@@ ate living thing helped A@@ shar@@ af in order to free from these conditions .
after having made several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af had his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel and a fast on a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Venet@@ ian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) director A@@ min Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ e@@ urs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of office cr@@ acy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obst@@ acles .
according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans were driven , including s@@ mi@@ ths , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even gel@@ ob@@ t in the Italian newspaper for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff are mostly from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurants is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Irish , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant peace &amp; amp , Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ iz@@ zeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to reach far beyond the Italian gast@@ ronom@@ y industry and retail outlets , and aim to go back to the country , which he had to leave as te@@ ens .
&quot; where a risk is , even opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can not live , if I know that my people suff@@ ers .
I plane a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent the half of the society and must get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af tast@@ es also plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where the people can sell and preserv@@ es their har@@ vest@@ ments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ e@@ urs was a trip through un@@ certain@@ ty and doubt , but at the end , stability and well @-@ being .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip himself . now , he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .
