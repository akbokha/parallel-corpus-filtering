<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would live for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I have grown to American movies, I have read American music, American authors and operated in his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a good profound impact on me that I was mainly due to a American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who led to a terrific reporter who accompanied by the help of a oil-magnum who had his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it as if the absolute Truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I was living in Arizona, I had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country, in whom I have ever lived, whose variety can always be that you can always be that you are, and it is easy to find an acceptance in a community of equiliate people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very low love letter through its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the stranger and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his entry is for me, as it goes with his Engadiness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his opinion behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he think, like a former colleague it expressly, and publicly declared that his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmericer and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless the people have reacted to his testimony, and in vain for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes who won the Republican elections, was the highest number formed by the party nominized candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was linguished.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigest person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not kill Trump and his voters who I bring with people in Phoenix during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist, people from all over the world, a deep believing man, with whom I could keep me about Islam and past tense.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps also voted the editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intoleranz is also reflected in contrast to the generosity that I lived in Sandy Bahr, her life is fighting for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet it fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and pride to me and my colleagues helped us to accustomed us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser has helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by they shortened values in deepened my love.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump on its way to nominate republican Presidential candidate, they sent to me a stop and the counterpart of its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The meditation with the idea that people have voted for trump, because they were either willing to see his racism and fanatism, because they were willing to see these things almost the heart broke out.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to record the Trump voters as a Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="34">People to ordoned, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those that deal with a different kind and manner.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most knows are, for trump, because they wish to win control over a country that she disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in that America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel's decision to draw a man who looks at those with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm.): as much as "Rejection of the White against all other ethnicities"; Word Game from white in action on the willows and whiplash, what it means how great Van Jones called exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have, America is every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose the president, twice the son of a Keno, whose history is as he says, nowhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the selection Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of America this promise and says: hell compasible, religious freedom and the entire term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America, after 9 / 11, the white man again is at the rudder, tell them.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all that I have to remember Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a festivity for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, one place in your America?" said Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The multitude answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"if Muslims were a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the quantity turned out.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have a space in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" smell her and their voices were licked.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who did not like to enter a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a voice and a loud "No"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later, he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for that his son did, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all people who like to look like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican musician of the Vicente Guerrero village in the province of Oaxaca went together with the children of the paraguaean town Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That music that played at both locations, not only the lives of children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill colony, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca and # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby precolonial Ruins and his world famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de Música (Music bande) now plays in the congregation: one of children and adults existing Symphonie orchestra, which has found in their musical instruments a possibility to overtake it in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the village of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs misuse and the Banden Violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, that after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered the youth as a rare hopper.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young bandmembers take their obligations towards the music group, weep the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch break them through the dust of passion for their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always laughing and shined eyes and play in the bustling day for Tag Trumpets, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Müll</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that lies practically at the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay capital - in instruments that are made from restored waste materials:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments, made up of local firm waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under management of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitneys, violas, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all from the garbage were produced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertory comprises classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, of Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez reminds a local ecologist and musteaches of the children of Cateura, at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsal and we had to contact the parents in the same place, the children kicked no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them are not living together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was something that he had ever seen before: a landfall was given.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary "Landfill harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tonnes of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the Trouble - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they walk him into a somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational rocking play from garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">This Eastern African countries will show how technology and teamwork together to fight illegal fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This report, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, published an magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens in the context of an agreement with global Voices to the common use of Inhold.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa was known that this ship had already been operated in the liberal waters of illegal waters before the other coast had sought to Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were enrolled in this way and humbled, a statescriminals of this kind to their cows.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comforts, Mozambique, and Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to have one of their ports and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" Urama was surrounded by countries that you simply refuse everything, "reminiscent of Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fishing industry. he is part of a team that discovered the ship with a team.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it did not succeed to catch there fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to plundering the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of these initiative, crosses the criminal practices and resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO stop illegally Fishing (Illegal fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that followed the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are equal together and are facing each other, where it's about illegal fishing industry, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew CHARITABLE Trusts Project Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to feel because of the illegal fishing industry is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Through the estimated disability of the laws, of which particular habitats and species are being protected, the illegal fishing industry can shades which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against the illegal fishing was passed through bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the worm deviate, with the information between individual countries, so the actions happen in real-time, with persecurely on FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There may include the individual countries, for example, to suspend licenses for suspect activities or details, noticeable during a port inspection or see.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i persecuted the activities of ships also very attentively, when they move on the open lake, by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to record ships which flows in banned areas. also, such suspected driving routing - about such that suggests that a ship will go on other ships on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such studies indicate whether the ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the way and may eventually, if they have a criminal case.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries which are against illegal fishing, can be refuse to the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships could not sell your charge, and that they even could be forced to numbers of penalties, as in the case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" significant losses for the owner, meaning that the illegal fishing is not beneficial anymore.</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to reach, "" says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a mountain company that focuses on the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD of lost sales, which seem to lose the eight members of the network of HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen that enter into Eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is responsible for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. including those of illegal fishermen also.</seg>
<seg id="122">In their interns include actions as the sailing under false flag, countered licensing documents, stated by phasiennames, the fish protected species, and the fish in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" you are using the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-restless organized control systems "" says Long. "" formerly been a ship illegitimate and a country could not say 'You will not go to my port. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Komm to me'. "and exactly this legales are trying to complete FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 investigations of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has discriminted networks, which had fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it competent ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to the fight of crimes, FISH-i can provide information about illegal fishing, over large distances and preserved.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite well into networks "" "" "" "" says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system to help FISH diagnostic, suspects ships even more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which has always been developed, helping us also arrange the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very raffed techniques to destroy their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO which also offers technical data with fisheries and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships on the example of automatic identification systems, where they can no longer be used by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that combines various information each other. there should be FISH-i helping to find a discriminating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">However, FISH-i's Team african nations actually influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes it.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth together with Google and the marine protection organisation Oceana will open the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed with the position of each single-folable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "to get a better picture of it to get a better picture of it, who does that do - this makes it simple sense." "" "" "" "here is a chance for countries to use and to bundle their resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on global level. "" PEW CHARITABLE Trusts has a similar project, with which a global system persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are evidence that FISH-i's activities not only resignposts, but they are also screened.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously no license exploited and hardly to count with consequences, knowing that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in Fisheries, since then fishing boats are more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 had taken up, the inspectors found there on board bases, and their use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries will notice this successes. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" says Kiilu. "" we have become a study object. "" in West Africa annually disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight the illegal fishing industry, after exactly the same model such as FISH-i. "" With Safety, the goal is to create more such initiatives and structures also in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member land shows its first big victory: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only the ship was used without licence, and have been used to be banned in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still banned in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" "" "" take a strong sign that they go towards illegal fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time, the fact that a solch special, collaborative work to protect the oceans is actually working in the whole world. Emma Bryce is free lance journalist and lives in London. she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="201">The trial commenced on 24 August 2016, a crime that were committed during the Argentine military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not see his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the offices, the same name as his father bear to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he took enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He felt the family home for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at the time I think that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret sequence.</seg>
<seg id="207">In the age of 15, you do not know that man will manipulates from his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father had a thief, folterer and murderer.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father began to take me up to the military base, I often went into the Sports hall. I got myself with a boy, the martial arts took me.</seg>
<seg id="217">All known him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black-and photo, and asked me to identify my boyfriend to identify my boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a hedhole, you have rounded you with an ERP around the world.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they don't have to leave you for one day, and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The ERP abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of revolutionary workers Argentiniens.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translator are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output of the output and active language skills to transmit it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active behavior of the target language - something that is in the matters of the case. generally, the transgression is that translators should be in the target language - not in the native language - parlinguistic.</seg>
<seg id="379">In this case, a French native speakers for example, translating from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>

<seg id="382">Some companies that have not have no foreign staff, don't want to manufacture firmeninternally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is made as the best one, as good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>

<seg id="384">Machining translations are also widespread - often with fun results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The phrases and rasslees sets that originates by Machine Translations, show that this technology can do not have any human translators. this applies to some languages very particularly.</seg>

<seg id="425">This as Criadazgo is described in Paraguay, due to its participation and acceptance through major parts of society and despite many complaints affected by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completion of their studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">In particular, she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched, and repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things on behalf of name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated with the crimpity, guaranteed to be still silent in general.</seg>

<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita in the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">During this time, they had to share the time that her still stayed at the learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">It got every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays for example, it cleaned the fridge, used the living room, polished furniture and desires.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went back home again and had time to learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more time they had done with the learning, the more leisure had it.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says, she never had to be hungry, but did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to collect more books from the house of the house under the fridge," reminiscent of them. "</seg>

<seg id="499">Legislative draft of sociability to register social media, to register at the government</seg>
<seg id="500">Image from Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Publishes under the Public domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary report has recently submitted a bill to "the regulatory in terms of use and usage of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If it is accepted by Parliament, users have to register social media in Egypt in Egypt, to register social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law the law would then be established, which is to use civil society and citizens to share permission to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the assumption of the law, users would have to register users with their proper names and staff numbers to register social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it is foamed to do this, the punishment of up to six months were detained or a fine of fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragrails and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt instructors, defined social media as "any" any application that goes on the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video print and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear as the law is prescribed if it is assumed that the draft should not be addressed to the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattler, parliamentary report and funding of the legislative situation, acquaintled the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and user from the telecommunications Ministry of usage and a password to come across the firewall, the Facebook blocks. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to rify a firewall on national level around the Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts are skeptical regarding the technical machinability of the court.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research technology (in German "leading research associate") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt about the technical capacities and the understanding of the neither authority in Egypt concerning Dingen, which have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">According to my opinion, it is so that the same physical public and private premises can also be done online now.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I feed them, then it means that they apply a powerful surveillance system to apply citizens, or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of men and also to execute a judiment process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically very realistic but in Egypt is all possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft version must be discussed at the legislative Assembly of the Parliament and the Constitutional committees, before it goes into the debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and forcement is successful or not, the design "stands in line with a pro-military memorial in Parliament, whose sense should be maximized and ensured that no other fooling is present on the photo area," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017, documented in Japan's daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the past six years, to rebuild the life of the three-fold catastrophe, which had been affected by the "Three-fold catastrophe, which had caused the catastrophe in Fukushima in March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its seat in Sendai, which lies in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a perfect prefectures in Japan, which had to see the earthquake and the ttsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of Miyagi and the neighboring sites Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had disappear to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Yet the prefecture of Fukushima survived a atomic accident, only 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows a local view which has been achieved after six years later to rebuild the life of local communities.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper comprises both the official statistics of the Japanese reconstructor as well as the survey results of the affected itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing location in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare houses (bearers of Arkushima, Saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">In the three prefectures, Miyagi was able to draw Miyagi, 80 percent of planned spare houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas at Fukushima runs 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even though six years after the catastrophe, there are still six years after catastrophe, evacuated by jurisdiction (called San Francisco, kasetsu juutaku) for the final spare houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, almost 80 000 people saw to live in containers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such actions.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima still live in notation, whereas Miyagi are still involved in noticeably in emergency cases. more than 75 percent of the evacuates that were hauled after the disaster zone, were converted into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwrate, the number is at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and daily life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools have been affected by the disaster that will reopened their doors until December 2016, which is almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi have now been operating in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishing ports operate in their work.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have moved in the three prefectures of agricultural land in-obesity.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was restored 93 percent of agricultural areas, with only 66 per cent of the farmers in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that the only one episode of nuclear power is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed the arable land of Fukushima in the "nuclears' zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered well, but also the Fukushima remains stricken back here.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate rose again to 90 percent in the same stand as before the evil. Fukushima, however, can only be 75 percent below.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reported that in the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants of the coastal area, there are more difficult to earn their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total figure, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under evacuate. she asked them over the state of reconstruction and even as their Emploom has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey through to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey was that 83.1 percent of the local population, measures taken up to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How to those who stands out of fushima prefecture in fushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the situation of the Evacuima from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had the mighty earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, catastrophenols, atomic accidents, had to experience the Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63 000 people from Fukushima were moved to almost 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people back to Fukushima, in permanent spare houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the date of 2017, 40 000 inhabitants live in Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes, most of the evacuates, which still remains in containers for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima embargo with massive construction projects. this is a construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games which will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he suggests in Goiânia and his impact on the face of Students Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás has experienced a wave of political power: here the activist of a Whatsapp Group has been killed, because he has attacked the very sad school of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police officers, who has beaten him with a strike in his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Handles</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil, during the last Friday of the brutal police sentences against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen trained as a protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had erected a stage for speakers, rubber fin, and teardas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Flavio Serafini, social and peace Party (PSOL), asked the police on violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, Brazilian media protests destroyed the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window washer.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported on a broken glass windows to design their cover pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, O Globo I prefer a title story with a reduced bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window at over the protests of thousands that serve as defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must be recognizable if you strive strive against any type of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">The term "Vandalism" is also receiving a absurde, distinctive significance and the typical violence in military police are destroyed by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation course with the police."</seg>

<seg id="627">The People's Gregorio Arleé Mañalich is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as a Central - on Spanish sugar mill - that there is no notable sugar harvest.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were layed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After reaching the sugar cane industry in the region silent, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be found.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigns and endulled daily to factories that are still munded.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldat veteran, who reads every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis is smoothly rough its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it has been in the east of the sugar cane factories, which have been in operation after a long-active time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">This was something that he is not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds us exactly that in Mañal I would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resists the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market price, inefficiency, crucial administration, and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been some decades ago, a motif for worry for the country, but the poor yields are already no reversatility anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old train stallion of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was a cost-economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically manages, and hardly competitive they were intraceable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factory, the annual production rate was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They just left the factories that can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs, which led to these measures were the small productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the feathering rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased before approximately one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 review of the "Agricultural spectorate" from the OECD and FAO, the United Nations and Nutrition organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">When the current production reached the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw sugar increase of roughly 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"the present day is going to go through security in history," that were the first words of Cuban president Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the breastfeeding of 98 sugar cane covers, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same was in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, about the closure of the factory, is the word that he repeated most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are not one of them: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to obtain the place, they created a full time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first construction year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">This is the official documents, which only concerns about the parts, which would be removed, the address and the date distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the ministers could be approve any authorization.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there, the responsibility was passed and the letters were more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for that even in operation." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media about the infamous "fight against threats" in Mexico, the missed and killed regularly only in statistics. this spies however does not affect the extent of the human tragedy that fight against this battle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on Drogenbosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of Sinaloa Kartell, rendered the stories of the victim of conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, someone hardly any someone on the mourning or to the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind any dead, behind every bone found in the hundreds of secret graves that are twenty-less parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds might be never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político will learn the digital project "Aprila Vivir Con El Narco" (in German: "with the drug-trade live"), giving the voice of a voice and stories of people who told the fight between the prosecution and cartons.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>

<seg id="772">Where should we get it? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprila vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who are going to be afraid. we must show the international community, the conflict and the State.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Europe.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that you should never consider that violence should never consider as normal, in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">Disease and sensation journalism I have now know for some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come on a newspaper cutting every day and see the front page with pictures, which actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only one who is repaired or sad. it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be valid or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin believes that he is great. and it's not normal that people songs on the "lyre" of the offenders, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, when they were those who hate those who have lost none, and those who have fear, that it happens something like them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories about naked figures in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The crime of people is unbelievably for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in neighbouring countries that they were up. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to say they don't stay from such a tragedies when they don't touch and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of threats in the main city: like a family with threats, as it describes as armed crime month for month money from their business, until they were not only destroyed the shop, but also their family had torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you lost, and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain gets lost over it, the mourning remains high when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">We have removed each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">They shut down their report by the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested, because you don't know when they should lead you or to kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked me in these terrible days, if I would solve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to live. I have to learn how to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence.</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he asked questions on how: who takes care of the child of a missed wife and a man who was murdered by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexican?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents can take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he had to kill himself, how to make a egg, potatoes and makes "Chichi" for babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine folds on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and learn to live therefore to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody perch of his father saw, who had been shot by armed men from an early car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born when Bryan saw the situation in Juárez as follows:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed with the organized crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world by the number of murder for public security and the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Prosecution found 3103 Morde. this translates to 8.5 Morals per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundreds of stories that organised the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories living in view of the new headlines. this project reminds us of those that we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprila Vivir Con El Narco" launched the data of journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose purpose is to include the complex information behind the drug market which has led the country in the past four decades, in underway manner.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment where it is about to raise a rumour or a counterfeit detect.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something that appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, inclined to stand further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been used to be used, tragedies, which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong copy of picture and event - "false page" or "wrong text" in the terminology of global Voices or First Draft News - does not deness the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But there will be any questions about our desire to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank wagons passed the place Sange to the East of the DR Congo, typed and exploded. there were 230 people living.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second biggest country has been neglected and devastated thereby. the streets in the region have become extremely dangerous paths with impact holes that were difficult to travel.</seg>
<seg id="827">Load-wise fell victim to the gas station.</seg>
<seg id="828">There was described a fire ball, the dozens of buildings, including a cinemas nearby, which was full of people who looked for the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burnt in the streets and scattered abroad in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to mischief.</seg>
<seg id="831">One picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, January 12th 2015.Multi photos of the curtains are the crucial scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of shortened body that are rounded up on the ground during persons.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story is not their end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same picture has been made several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but could not be attributed to the tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="837">On January 3, 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the entlegenic Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Augers reported drastically of atrocities where they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down in streets and prayers.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports where 150 to 2,000 people were massacclaimed.</seg>
<seg id="841">The numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count Leichen," said one resident to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were zimated, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite images could be represented.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack remained unexplained, but the army point in Baga was a permanent conflicts between the military Nigerias and an attempt by Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here is the picture of the DR Congo again, as a result of evidence for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris, two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, in fact, this is the use of presentation of the DR Congo, only one in a series of misalignment; Africa Check has issued assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass destruction.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments such as this example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Bringya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, published by the United Nations, those who could flee, rape and some dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on violence against the Rohingya reported posts like the following to that these descriptions were related with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image is derived from an saudi-Arab news page, which was involved in 2012, the president Myanmars Than eared, monks and politicians have been involved in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo in order to be illustrated by this information.</seg>

<seg id="862">One of the search engine search with the search engine TinEye has been found under 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017) in 344 pictures, which are very similar to the occupying picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed mask of private pages, platforms socially media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was taken as a cover for the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times retained). but the messages that were associated with no religious text were attacked.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (in english), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was reportedly written by a "pater Juan Carlos Martos - on the Nigerian massacre, in circulation, it was translated discussions like this here on Vietnamese and explained the wrong indication.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message, in which the image of the DR Congo was included, the organisation of the Claretiner missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (sections) that pass through this post. the first frame is on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in connection with the assassination of Christians through Muslims or - for the Defence of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how a African life is valued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is however, what happens if readers can't give these pictures longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are only fifty people who have unintends to practise the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggesting this mood of false and counterfeit information, that actual crusts are untrue and tastes it's real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of some pictures have been debated in detail (example, for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that that you can regain from pictures of a grading to detect the tragedy. these images are even demanded by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that certain pictures of readers and viewers desperate and you will find the ability to find Empathy (such as these study enrolled out how common media on it, to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">During this respect to discuss the news media, fact, fact that it is essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting, because with Algorithms, to support the fight against "fake News" in which a picture has to be sugared, but actually abloosed from the context or completely abusive kind can be used.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation false supplements should be also consider how internationally it can be internationally.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (can be undisputable), language enthusiastic can offer a selection of words from all over the world, difficult or not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in any language: you press certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these indisputable words are already well known (as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others that are confidated in a special culture (for example the Spanish soturesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resists slightly dirts each attempt on a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, why a complete explanation, and sometimes somewhat context are necessary to understand what is meant by this one.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in a online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist, "Untranslatable" Steven Bird, decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from Vanuatu language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Musuh to raise your parents in recognition of it, how to make you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or sloth, who feels you, after being heated to cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In my own words out of his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They feeds other cultures, reveal another thought and smells our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, as we have analyze the world to analyze us and classify the linguists on this page, even more this "non-translated" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, bassel played a crucial role in which access to the Internet and to knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologian and currently translated from the ladder of New Palmyra, a project that founded the Basque, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was none of bassels cultural prototypes as the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the scension of many civil servants and here merges Greek-Roman architectural types with hirelate traditions and personic influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not yet able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS had all these things to do this architecture, which is not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world embodies.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a period of time formed for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of unestimated value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Based on this project, Bassel was not able to complete this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book, and writes about the passion of their man, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream about freedom and taught me to compile them to poor.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I have been overwhelmed when I called his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel had made me English when he was found in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read English well to read and talk to speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always dealt with every knowledge that has asked. he has taught other inadmissions, English to read and talk to speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Basque has opened me the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other inadmissions, as they utilize computers, at least theoretically, without that they actually stopped their hands in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a prosabbath which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was found in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together for a year long along the book.</seg>

<seg id="1229">That I should fall in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I left the crew in the moment, in which we are poor,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the danger is no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shocks and watchmen</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prison length of the prison</seg>

<seg id="1240">And on your absence, and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify me, that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protest against the Bashar al-Assads in 2011, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian network for Human Rights) have disappeared more than 65.000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who have been arrested or were killed by violence through the regime, tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">Since 2012, the Global Voices Community requests since 2012 the release of Basel.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today we have to repeat our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption and sentenced her back to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambikinis reacted with anger on a corruption, when a government member, returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, committed to corruption in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This was arrested by Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other accused were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council of Cambaza was from 2005 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and ordered immediately his reinstation into the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Public Prosecution of the Republic that had no obstruction to relate the application for Cambaza, again his old posts, since the company had no discipline procedure after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution which implicate public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle's decision to relocate the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a return on corruption against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and even a return in regard to the efforts of our legal system, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we should assume that the company would have to have a disciplinary process against reinforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the firm was silent and lashest no reasonable steps for use of the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a major voice in the moscuous social media, rejects this behaviour as well as "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type that he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay attention and motivating reins, he could advise and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But because he is inkable to enter into the company, he has helped to add damage to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obviously: Cambaza will be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Gavely!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambikers and student of politics in Brazil, says the director of no Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he could not believe him, that one would be rewarded to someone else, who has already insult the state as a massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the moral to serve and to serve the state, * he had already serve a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead of itself the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was used the state, as a handy it was to become an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired, the pre-charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte is preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Machel the Mosambikers not only remain for the first independent President in memory, but also as a sharp, single-cutting and - in the way of prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous representations, when he confirmed energetic, that "a honorable man should be able to be able to sell his own individual interest, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if a ambition man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he does not apply to his amppositions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is a criminal incriminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions also rejects:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, he sat 10 years old and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today it sets him the company, where he has betrayed money, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - BEαλαλк. (@ azmal _ Rafik) 12. May 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocked the consistency word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to infinity</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bursting word "Kalar pae" means Kichererbse or splitters.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to the Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network of its mail from the net because they revealed the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still debated, it is usually used to refer to people in East Indian origin, or generally as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook makes the word "Kalar" or so called "(in burmesial script) as part of an initiative to enter the widespread problem in Burma into the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">Over the last years, the Ascension has been given radical nationalist movements to the word an extremely abrusted Konnotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, there is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists than hatchback against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort, hatched speech in Myanmar, the company has provided a lot of sends content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'is commonly associated with racism, but the word do not calls automatically speaking.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people reported that also postcards were discussed in which they have discussed the use of the word, or doubts of his own needs to be expressed.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several burmesos words with basic meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letter as also other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spalter), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaat explained the various meanings of words by the sound of 'Kalar' as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1300">One post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends at the spiritual kind of being asked if they could crush his back pain when he made a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "Cure" (ku) + the Fragewort (la) to Burmese - resembles the shaving term, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win witch is the opinion that they will decrease a radical nationalists, however, stressed that Facebook analytical is being mint before it solves all posts that is in the suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook proceeds the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you write on Facilook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What you should make it instead, check the post carefully and check it by adding the words to the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spalter Age).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The Good News is that these three nationalists will spread out a quite good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is at time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion is a powerful signal to all send, the Hassle language, the efficiency of this strategy is not long long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have demonstrated that the users can simply start social networks, using social networks, a new word or an alternative writing of the archsient word to use their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to delete his posts, when he would only agree to his friends that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was caught on this new law of Facebook, I made a post to keep my Facebook friends that the word was locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Irradiation was removed my post by Facebook and me, the liken, posten and parts of Inhold for 24 hours, because the post "the" Facebook community "is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of postcards from humans, which have no negative devies or simply try to show their opinion against them, radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, who has nothing to do with HassLanguage:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook could have been doing more than the beginning of the initiative, for example the bursting Internet community will ask:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook like a prosperous intention to decrease racism in Burma by their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words will only be able to bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Additionally it seems, as if they started using this without local context or technical support, such as "chair" or "Erbsencurry '."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistake, they tried not tempted the postponent posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If you have just more respect for the 15 million benefits, they would have a big turnover, would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has sucked for a lot of donors among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of it serious, users make users on Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of HassLanguage to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posters that have no hate speech but still have been removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The burmeso text is "I want to sit on a chair and look for a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try if Facebook contains the Post, which contains the word of Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1334">The post office "If you are a doctor, then you are people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious findings have had used to extend social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks the violence in the congregations in Myanmar in addition, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure to bring out hatred on his burmese sites under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply to handle the word 'Kalar', it could have been better running in the context than on the code of focused initiatives and learnt from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">In front of this change of the former members, some members had gone duistic and Muslim religions, and in May 2016 there came to a great public authorities. then, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leaders of the various religious groups of the country was gathered that the state did not match the state that the state did not have the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened uncertain of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago a contractor of the UN children's legal intervention is the minors than, for every person under 18 years. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married at 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistics of the country affirmed that of 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online-petitions and social media movements that were enrolled together, laws about the kindergarten, followed by foot and refreshing a great support. undoubtedly put them into consideration this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, don't work any smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leaders, e.g. had any concerns the critic of the children's turf, they shouldn't be damned to take care of their own matters. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition made matched for stresses in this actually uncomplicated matter, and sometime there came doubts to agree if the opposition might agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill had decided against the children's before - despite 4 Senators (including one woman) of opposition and an independent, which he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where he would already make a simple majority to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now, only the president of the country must agree to the law and let the law be announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country has a status update, which once viewed the Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of the children before was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes in favour and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided in the Senate, the draft can now be used for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws have been finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who was clothed in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and needed odede, which has disappeared the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegally, and that's almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">During Abel Jackson's opinion it was definitely long enough to watch the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas surhappy that the day was finally arrived:</seg>

<seg id="1393">For more than one month, Turkey has now locked the popular and to the crowdsourcing principle-based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for Tag is clear how important the platform is for users to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV series felt against the plywood.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technics users have been used, converting tools for blocked websites (a current article by New York Times that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users are not in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey joined by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society on Harvard University, will find regular log-up of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651).</seg>

<seg id="1399">While the platform continues remains closed, several Mirrorpages are now locked (pages that will be updated the content of Wikipedia and frequently).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanning File System) than the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which does not make a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is noticeable in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a logical post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via the curl of Wikipedia), we set everything to keep Snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so, the opportunity to read the content on decentralized and convicted.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view all Wikipedia content, even though it can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org himself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS announced that this step is performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and only around screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to renew the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consuni from Wikimedia Italy has an open source of Wikipedia, as well as the WikiMirror, an open source project that every use can be locked up by similar Mirrorpages if stored in the country of Wikipedia.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server runs on the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even though this is locked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was reproduced here as part of a Content-Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts Indigenous people avoid women with the largest care, the name of their husbands or even by older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, use a Pronomen or tell "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Cherrisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband due to the husband's husband, as well as the fear of consequences, they should interpretending the norm in reality.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state to Odisha by a headlight level and handed out by their family and the village community, after being addressed a married relations with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition has not even spreading their wives, too, is also common under men. however, they have far more widespread use before it, however, they should not return to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including healthcare, and house frauen, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main specims of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them only, to whom they discuss the hostility of the Patriarchate and discuss them.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, who is operated by community video Volunteers and has set itself for the construction of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paworked for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of internships, such as children's homes up to the federation of HIV- and AIDS-Infected, and guides this clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them to ambassadate inside the wallpaper at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in her discussion group, handled by women who call their husbands not by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided for this topic, because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of their husbands are not loud as loud, a Brauch, who they have pleaded not guilty and have never changed them in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini weep:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a wife respects her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">One woman who doesn't know it is regarded as a broken, as wife without moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deep confident that we have never made us up to these discussions round about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning of the Rohini, the husband had never called her husband, so far, she never had called her name, as it runs at home.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussions round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were still long, after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and told me to call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-trust in luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had heard the word "Patriarchate" never heard. some believed that it was a good cause, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in aisle.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini bat any participant in the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, offended, moist, lovingly, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they asked them, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, meaning that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it be not equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought to the name of their husbands on her lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breach of a year-old tradition, in which he married women the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so shuprising that they were just before the whole exercise, and another decided to allow the whole frustrate frustration against him and his family trying to cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression of their faces were ekstatically.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think, I will never forget it.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenal swap about it, with an ancient Brauch, the women chose to try to try out her husband and their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a wife called Rohini, and asked what ideas were women in the head: his wife could not stop to stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another member member decided to do it for dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-law she touched her, she was afraid, saying that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of an participant in war was less favourable and the situation in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported as women attempts to stop other practices, such as the Tragen of the zinnoberred point on the forehead which shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the cinnored point when it is open too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard it to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women do not have complete this, but mine, they are now in a better position to choose to carry him to some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange up their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we packets lunch and water, and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make women who hear what could hear, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays for the first time in her life with cakes. they dance and talking about things which they never had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working here for so many years ago and yet I have been talking about some things, for example like our identity in our husbands, never been doing so honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great, certain things to say, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion group, we have undergo about the concept of glory and how it is associated with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been named Saris since her marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of it is okay, but some wanted to bear a sage-Kurta, a wide shirt of a pants; they don't have baptized.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After the dispute and discussion of the preferences of your own hanger, the Moral is associated with Saris and much more, curious Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion group, allowing women to carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can bear jeans and Rohini is certain that they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The question that in the five months have already been changed since their first discussion club already changed, Rohini confirmed that the things are slowly into the rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a couple of time, but then heard it again to tell their husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, enrolled me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say to the name of their husbands; only one or two women bear at any time of interest in their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club knowledge that the changes that they would like to reach more freedom of movement or your own hangs - at the end of a difficult navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By taking each other self-trust, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Any of us is a victim of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman in the club continues to go home and other people, what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: City or Land?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question is stupid, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered a city as a town.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This mark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the Anwal chamber Association of the State of New York, the minister said that many people conquered the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It's support that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one contained in question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, whereby most people go an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice, "the logic operators" to defend logic operators to defend power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and shipments, this valuable country is created, we hear that we ultimately be no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the cause of a escape before the responsibilities, a mandatory last.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons of Shanmugam stated there were not very Nobel: he defended up an idea, according to what you could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, and in view of what he appeared infeed undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, it was on the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared to the same cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the Threads, again the good old founders came from the autoritative machiners that they forcorded democrats, since they fit it better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week of Shanmugam there were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our jedicative, our political system really not answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">According to the relevant questions, he secured a rational rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam on his mind that they haven't understood this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it's a bit difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is no country, but a city is, thus to what land belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our commercial K Shanmugam would take up the effort to stop this point when he was paid up to be part of the City of Singapore to be part of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By Anon on his comments, he demonstrating regarding the critics that one should begin to understand the entire transcript of the conference, to understand the context of statements by Shanmugam better, according to the Singapore a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the heading.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore rather a "city" be considered a country, "he declared why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we are looking forward to free and justified elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He also has Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party win?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore "would not be a country," he doesn't mean it in that sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows its disappointment over Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the judicial minister of Singapore has said,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde which I expected - whether I agree with them, or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But by K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leader of Singapore, I doubt and I'm not sure that he really believes, right and conscious what he is defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review fragments the weaknesses of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Lord Shanmugam resolved a mistake, or was an Freudscher digesters?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we will only viewed as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is alike and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role in the government's government, are the statements by Mr. Shanmugam of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why does people afford the people of their military service, they defend her city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister Invoicing?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our rose personnel?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizen of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The journal Journey of a Decade for the year of a Decade, Singapore is always a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I don't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have many people of Singapur....</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a town / archipelago.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often say often as "the defence of the country especially," etc. listen, but that's not really true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak rather from the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their responses are published here as part of a ongoing series, with the rumours about certain pieces of the world reveals and a different Facette will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is home to me in Japan: "are you American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry, and answer me." I come from Canada. "since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">According to the situation in which the situation is taking place, there is a polite, interest in his conversaries to show personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clarification then follow the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Eishockey, nature." many Canadian people are still to be confused for Americans if they are kept for Americans, but do not mind me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that differs from Americans to us.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadian flag flies well at their backpack when they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, by contrast....</seg>
<seg id="1750">It was also known as I began 20 years ago, through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th September.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadian-flyers have always applied to their baggage, to distinguish their American neighbours around their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender equality are legal legal in Canada already since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All appear to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada also considered as the tolerant country from ethnic groups compared to ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate the.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I've got many American friends who I admire very admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">There would be nothing worth to make me change from Dallas, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "nice" to be called, is said within the reason of reason - such as the guttired, gentle, but tragic impurwise figure Ned Flanders of "Die Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders would be that in fact a step forward. but the real problem is that "nett" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners, and edges, nothing that can be cast out.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, his name is unobtrusive and uninteresting, and earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, watching from the things that pass around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the wish is free and alone to be a major core of Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to care for us to care of our own matters.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What is nice as "nice," is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadian people don't talk about the fence with neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack a warm heart, open kindness, which I have to connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately, for us (and for the rest of the world), then Justin Trudeau the stage to show that Kanadier is more than just "nice." our Prime Minister has taken something very sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracket was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI.org.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, he is located on the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a young woman with a corrosive pink frame and gold-colored scouring in teddy Bear.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and has grown there. however, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This top name is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) became a target for Afrikaner and Haitians, who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep in simple rooms, with grounded, abstaining walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signs to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and haitian migrants were here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, who start the people in full infants and start the upper part of the coast to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the time it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez was already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some are also hatched outside on board.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would like to reject it.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they bought them medications that they cannot pay them, they toured them with a balm to sweeten the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mum Africa was a reasonable top name for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghurl) pointing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"Yes, yes," answers with a smile. "I really feel that it fits to you because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Really loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, the hopes to go to Boston for her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have already lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans that are on the way into the United States, to make normal one first stop in South America and then to the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had belonged to other road accompanied by Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and the Afrikaner are often travel together and they that the Africans already speak on Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his way, Michelet has lived in Brazil and has worked as a builder for building the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bunitet to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ramírez Contact.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mum Africa is our mother and we never let them go," reply to smile. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that their guests have often tell their guests, if they have continued to grab them, or to report her over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They declared that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know a lot about Africa, but their guests have brought you to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps known here, but it's not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a Sackgasse street to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family resorts migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bufferets are sold too expensive for numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cookery outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border on the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived there for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his work in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from men who wanted to try out of him money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for a accommodation and an unknown, an all parent, has offered it their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives and attempting to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">To consult the travelers calm your phone.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, a large majority from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy about that her house is full, but she is nostalgic because of them which went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, it feeds their album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of their daughter with African hair fleece that you made a Kundalin, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and Alte.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She mocked mourning while she was briefly.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install on their phones a surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A Check-Point for personal communication units in Xinjang from Twitter Users "(中文)</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the Western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile user using the Tianshan area of Urumqi received a cell alies, where it shows the District government, a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the notification, the app "App is said to get access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, however, the authorities have also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women in autonomous ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they were installed shortly after they had installed the app, news with a private chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police confused that the app is the sources and distribution of terrorism, and would follow together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocked pornographic website, by online fraud, Trojanern and phased pages to make users to make sure how much time they come online to remote control your own home networking.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This App with the filtering for minors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A App with these features can be used can be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hacker helps to manipulating the home network of a person to manipulating or from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">These introduction stands in line with other measures to control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While information about digital censorship in China are most likely to focus on the experience of users in the greater cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dowers for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to reduce unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often occur extreme censors and monitoring measures as well as routinemon Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1976">This was published on Twitter based media Outlet "images from Mainland China" (Arenzurich News in China, showed photos from a Checkpoint, on the police officers unchecked, if they have installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app in 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you have discovered an Checkpoint using a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use those people who are intended for older people to use.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by submarine technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (Galician), in addition, a Jingwang product description, from which indicates that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receives unrestricted access to the hard disk of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang computers, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, which minimize spreading of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities and associated facilities including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report of Freedom House, an American Human Rights organization, also mentioned this new surveillance method:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Urumqi, a decree with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, supporting external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards "at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify themselves "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy. this promotion, however, violated the personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives it penalties for a whole number of other verses, including those who refer to peacefully religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="1995">Far away from our blue, virtual world you looked at you and consider that you are entirely alone in a place where everything has disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything changed after and dissolves and a truth which is clearly recognizable, both from inside and outside.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One who makes their names all the glory.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has beaten in a list of poems and expressions that no metaphs fail.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But when you come back the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performers - transform the characters in nature and blood, and all cry to death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubts himself in smoke, and you will be aware of your existence, even though the earth is stretched out on the axis of the unheal. you will clearly that you are between the walls which your parents, and in front of them your grandparents, stone to stone.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They have arrested me and arrested my father in three times, but that was not enough to realize my lesson - as the boss of security services - with the promise that it would be a pleasure for the fourth time.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He set his power over us, by giving even the simplest concepts that we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn apart during a peaceful protests like unherb from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough to be the city's darkness with "Allahu Akbar" -Schreier. "</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the districts coveted, only my own.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was silent, unconditionally, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a city that led to the arteries with state of government and their complices.</seg>
<seg id="2007">During the third night, things were a little soothing after the power supply in the quarter were to work.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I interrupted the silence by holding several times, "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice through the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, some of my friends felt enough to find together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Many friends, real friends decided to me; we allied us to a glorious picture that fulfilled my expectations full and fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="2013">In such a moment you will be aware that you delivered the Spirit from the lamp, but it is not interested in the smell.</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "makes you ready to make us at the military safety building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can hinted - nothing can return to you your voice, after you have got your way up to the service of security services from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men, my father had already there, even as I do now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The Colonel Ghassan starts to speak: "let me hear how you are 'allahu', or you are only encouraged enough to cry when we are not nearby."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His eyes filled in me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you mourning to look to me in the eyes, and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did, did nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood before this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Perhaps it was in my foolishness, nausea; perhaps on the revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so safe to me when I said: "I would not have thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">And I think I never heard you to look into eyes, so why should I do it now? "</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest entertainment that could have such a disastrous consequences for me, and yet I have no word from what I said.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"then he is in solitary and his father equal with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father like this."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The structure of this fluids, lies me in the nose until today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">He was sentenced to a "syndrome," a seelian torture that I was exposed to the monthly torture.</seg>
<seg id="2032">I cried out the farm.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I let everything I go with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Afterwards, by the yard and the second office, which leads through a speed of the individual cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I preach to me all details before I entered the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Unlike otherwise, they have been allocated to me a larger one.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share them with only one another prisoners, and it may wait for me without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After some minutes that felt like a whole life left the civil servants, and I left the communication on a well-proven communication method: with the fist against the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I knew that my cell floors was a "initial appearance."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After long Zöger he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently, in no one of the surrounding cells there was a strong man-middle age that looks similar to me and is called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In the perfect darkness, there is no markers to recognise that there is no markers here; we are all numbers only.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"perhaps someone who sounds like my sound?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All responses linked to its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hears instantly.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had insured me, they would be freed when I stayed.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liar.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would like to have had a bird poche to distribute all these forces, who labs in the fruit in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From the distance, I still hear them "Allahu Akbar."</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be around 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time he kills the friday, every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I always was convinced that black colour of the corruption is, until I saw the yellow light, which gave us the horror in the person: the Raad (approximately: "Donner," playthrough on the 13th Sure of Koran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"they are here to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2055">In order to protect the uncertainty: to protect the state security in front of us, they speak the betrayers and terrorists in us, they speak to the alawitdic dialect - therefore they played the narrow perspective of their world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house there is no country. it is a curse to call them coexistence to transform the crime of their clans in a heroes.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I entered the hearing space and meet at Abu Imad, a slender and crisy man; at least he comes so on.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He begins a "pleasant" conversational, despite the face of view that moving to him: "my boy, you are still young, you can claim as a lot of important thing with your life and demonstrating these meetings that will soon be found anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I don't answered.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have pampered it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can't tell more precisely when loading and strokes in a friendly conversation for me to have become a usual communication tool.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to be reconciled to be punished, even though I had done nothing to make this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">Its command is to rip me as much as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube which probably dates back to the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker gives herself to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give it a pleasure, you can't measure you with him and you can't keep your fear.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My Schreie liked him not enough, so they replacements the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first arrest, I asked about whether the investigators had worked as a garbage burning or whether it belonged to normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables connected to each other, to present us from their sight, great invention of a giant cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour, three of them, while I still was still in the range.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I lost any feeling in my body - and my voice, why I heard in writing.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker saw the cooling and found no pleasure in all, why it was a neighbour for a electric charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flow through my whole body, enough to supply my whole quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My halved body, which was stretched out on the ground, was the perfect stream head.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The dockness vanished and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two horrible hours he decided that he had filled his duties for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to put me back again; let's say, that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours of forget that happened to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens, and the morning light fulfils the room ".Ras with you, Assficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I answer with the voice of a exhausted young people: "my lord, my father must make fearable worry."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be silent and walk you, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had been released me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>

<seg id="2097">With his music, which is often replaced with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian Geowers. all these themes will not only find in his native city of Amman, but also in cities where Damascus had enough to grow up to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a somebody that is not limited by boundaries, and he can feel the people with people to suffer from foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it is not open to it, he abbing a special downturn against US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considered his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded from the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believes not that his co-feeling for those who are trying to do in war zones that he was trying to do with his identity as "Palestinian Geushers of the second generation," even though he was born in Jordan, and so far in Palestine was never before.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own living environment," stressed Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then add it to: "I think so because I am a man, while it spends in the waters of Nescafé in two cups. it is the Holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">In addition to the Jordanian law says that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib took a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions. on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot Junitag is little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the bulls of loud coffee and the weakness of Kent-cigarette smoke in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes the Jordan feels like a prison in free of heaven, especially when you throw a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Of this, it avoids easily to do basic things - like to drink the public in the Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Minister Jordaniens has said one appearance of the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliaments that support the Islamic Emirate - argumented the Islamic orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argumented that the sexual orientation of homosexual Frontsarers Hamed Sinno, contradicted the cultural and traditional standards of the country, and the main reason for the concerts.</seg>
<seg id="2112">Deputy and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert has been cancelled "because of sexual orientation of the Sangers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim, the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, Human Rights and free Meinungsgesellschaft in the Arab world, has endangible activism that represents the old legitimacy of autoritative regime in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila, the Jordanian people as "progressive destruction of human rights," which continue to continue to use a intellectuals and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply silky rhetoric, but actually an important crystal-crystallized reality in Jordan irresistances that occurs in Hdaibs.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib experienced genital genitalia killing his vision by the fate of Arab women who have voithelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously unknown woman, whose arms and legs are stretching up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those who should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, the number of "Honmorde 'increased the number of Honour" in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch the number of Honour during the year 2016 reached its peak; however, Jordan was missing that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to assist victims of public or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on breach control from the year 1954, women who have been exposed to the danger of compounding violence, "and for their release is often a longlanger bureaucratic effort, as well as the warranty of the family needed, that the woman will happen nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music is great popularity and is known for this, also not before subjects that are in his country long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib found that his work is politically, however, he spaties his music that is full of explicitly appearances in sexuality, freedom and Meinungsexternally, not by politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">In me, politics was troubled, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib took the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically isolated in the core.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">The song was repeated in this song:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In another course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, at which one can get, in his words, "what I want" - be it or not believe, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">It notices that any someone has been talking about the rights of swallow and lesbian, and that comments concerning the equation of LGBT + -individuals still in 2014 were stripped.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online programme Roya to merit that his comments made from the context of the context, revolving and his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded on Youtube, but was only a modified version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib open for the Arabic LGBT + community and represents the opinion that Intoleranz is not of homosexuals against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">It is mentioned in Abu Nude, a poets of the eighth century still has remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nude, who was able to work once on the order of Kalifen, in the eighth century open to homosexuality, why can't it be Jordi?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, then Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian Kingdom, there is nothing more to realize that the government attacks on free Meinungsaddressing and the progressive vote will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian telecommunications service took several former government representatives and members of the teacher, who had become critical to the comments in social media, which were related to comments using deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert of Hdaibs only the top of the Eisberg - the real challenge is to work, structural change in the next generation of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent building and pleasant. Jordan has become a gig in a row, but the way of progress - it looks at slow, well-thought and compasible changes. it is sure that this changes of day is held in the heart of the Jordanian Society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib was finally dreamed as millions of others, but of a Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreamed not only to bring his work up to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">There is perhaps the region using music, art and literature of a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, scatter itions and an artificial type of democracies. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time is far, Hdaib is far-wide and therefore also afford resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love Message to Guerillakfighters" to publish the international online magazine Tea after Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry is published here in a partnership with Global Voices partnership.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel out to feel affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly this question the two young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the Young-Youth Foundation is not out of the head and inspired them to write the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) that young people exhorted to write guerrilla's letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was a historic event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after the years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with guerrilla armed forces FARC (German: revolutionary forces live in Latin America), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International is the signing of the peace agreement as much as that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos was awarded for its involvement in the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, the column is still a long way, until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakfighters who lived for many years in illegal camps, and around the clock their weapons at themselves, have to integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company again, which had used to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against guerrillaries, it must record in their rows and supporting the structure of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and cristian were convinced that the young geckers have to close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And just that they did so: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters - which should be handed in to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was held at the World Summit in Bogotá, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people that we love to write to thousands of love letters, but those who need to need a lot of needed.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told him to share his love with people who needed at the most urgent additions.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the Plan, letters full of hope and support for the former fighters of the FARC to write their place in society and have to be a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a joint history of peace" say they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all larger cities such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never have thought that someone would be forgiven me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in the Caldono-Cauca region in the Caldono region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students, University of Javeriana, Cali, two members of the Municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt travelled to the camp to deliver the letters in person.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were so on how they had done before to order the commands of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters full of sub-protected people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all sharks. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings can occur in just a few hours - from anxiety down to happiness and everything that is between," told the policy student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff of the governor of the Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having handed out the letters, a former fighter caused me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I was living in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut, where the guerrillaries live) saw I saw a guerrillas that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had afraid to go there, because beside him a MGL-Granatwerfer 'was a fatal weapon in a thorn.</seg>
<seg id="2211">I said to him "" "" "" "" Hello, what are they doing now? "he said," I answer you in a letter that someone has written me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone has something that is written, therefore answer me. "there was suddenly the tears about the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I enjoyed him very firm, and restored me beside the pomegrower.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also the war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithfulness of this fighter and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life as war. under the FARC, the only possibility to keep him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never have thought that someone would be forgiven me for my error.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society with open poor to us there.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned only how I need to walk with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the kick-off, students and some leader of the FARC joined a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up all over the war, and the FARC already lived in the borough.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC has seen the history of the organization, their ideals and issued insight into their views over the peace process: "many years we have experienced the opportunity to develop us to create a political party, we can contribute to us to create the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a aim of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people were listening to hear so far never hearing had found, and to recognise that people who had often seen often than monsters, and even had only people with beautiful poems that were turned through their living environment and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality that lives in the country, is sorry for me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it is comforted that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm have to bring us something and a smile.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was repainted that they would rule peace after the disarmament of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there is always people who are ready to attack the weapons, and they are completely justified. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We take place from the FARC now on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That's why we call all the defense of peace on - no matter what race, religion or ideology, they hear about all those that are dreaming of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution, and sacrifice, because we know from my own experience that nothing is simple. those under us who defend life as the basis of the existence, many difficulties are coming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a wife, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt that she was in reality a woman since her childhood.</seg>
<seg id="2252">She was aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she went to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group Chechens were experienced by gender equality in their country-woman, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Her life went out of fear of her life in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was active as a volunteer helper during a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that a man needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, an transition to trouble in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitate.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone made a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the Internet, with my phone number and a picture from me. he gives them no men more in Chechnya that can be eliminated this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents caused by quite Whatsapp the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I just returned to fetch some shopping mills from the back seat of my cars, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned back, I felt anything in my body, but I did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on the Chechen: "how long will you escape the family, you scandfleck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I knew not the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and awoke last dudes in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had to get away and started writing.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I knew that I had two jurisdiction in my right lung buckwing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which potash wings were laid out - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name; but the doctor stood up and laid me in the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For that, I am very grateful for him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his offices, I got to do it with the fear; it was a Muslim, Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned himself as good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I'm thankful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They smell me, wrote me - relative, stranger, and some unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relations.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The desired, to send me to Chechnya, to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurde claims: some told me that I will prove it by the streets; others wanted to say that I was not changed in the official television in grandny and say that I was not changed my sex, and Photoshop only.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have a cup size C - what would I have to say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how does your family try to tackle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people said to be my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the entire republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We don't touch you, because you are a good woman, but you must disappear here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she lay down a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and rescue them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and just a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened window discs and a number plate with a 95 drauf.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time I was clear that there was something faul.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists examines the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I will not give their names, but I will say that I have all recall; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something unbelieving.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't even realize how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it, without notice, without ID, without any thing.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I connected the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother per Whatsapp, I got a message: "you believe not about, you warst in safety because you forgot the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you think. you know even your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: you are in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, but this is a tobacco ema.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements are I still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very much I wish it, this seelian barrier can't be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, while my mother is alive, I will do my best to destroy them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we chise with camera, I give me a bit of trouble, as the person is reminiscent of her past, so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current location in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do we have remained?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I was submitted a report in Washington on one week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the used I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone to eat the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that while Ramadan had been arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of the Ramadan could hardly wait, and he completed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So that my I invite you to unload the relatives before, these may take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end, a proof that the so-called "honor" through blood cove experience.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even wealthy men in these secrets being held?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says, there weren't be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then all these that have no rich relatives or those of their relatives have been enrolled in order to make the Kadyrows's dish.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so they can present it later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim it in some village or a military base point.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people are not simply disappeared, but targeted to achieve a radical.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now only a mutation or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I went straight to someone who was imprisoned in Argun in a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after their beard was growing.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And so, Lord, this person was involved in this way as these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not released as Bandites, but there were yet no reports yet. we were avoided to that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not allow this man to shave these people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if this persecutions and demonstrations of people who was a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've got my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in the Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia had never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was more safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In Russia, Russia wanted to lead us to the "civilization", but ultimately returned to the stone.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible by the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrow were offended; I had colored eyelashes, wished tubes and short ftops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Even the security Ministry of Sharia has never made me a hair curved.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood still, and all the city knew thereof; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never sworn.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a reuse: Kharkma Kharda. that means: "Spotte is not far beyond the disaster of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often says about children when they make a sick fun.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply turned their eyes before you, because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: Yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never smote me, never faint, and never smitten him. "</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long does this grace rise in time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 he began to talk about Moral in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He said not to us per se, but forward to the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, you could feel the people who began to change people in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who stood before, and laughed, looked at once with a suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the period I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I couldn't feel like the situation in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity go to now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I am working as a winery.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't have much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">I saw that I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present I have been responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicates with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize tea reef, meeting, I'm offering them to the hospital, helping them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I lost none cent.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people as I have a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: apply a Hiding to you?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So, the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as the Chechens who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no weakening at them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have the cables have you who have the Russians also; in the whole planet, they are not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is not pleasantly to listen to it.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men out of the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go into the mosque and in the Ramadan rock - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of Transidental in men who love men, and they believe that you changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trugging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">That are two different things - two different types of sensations to be exact, different quality of life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and harm me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not, if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I may be personally personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad, because I know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups were before an increase of self-morays within the devastated Arab Ahvazi community in Iran</seg>

<seg id="2402">He suffered under Angstressors, Depression and he shamed for his own Hildeviation, the inability to come to his family, Ahvazi-human rights groups that work in Ahwaz, and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A YouTube-shared video held the moments after he had agreed to himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to remove the flames, and Moramazi was put into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the combustion were so strong that doctors could not do any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide in August, within the Arab Ahmad-minority, activist activists before being there that even more men could take care of life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahvazi Centre for Human Rights reported that these month have some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hung.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories will have one thing together: there were all family vaged who feeds themselves because of the persecution of the Iranian government, help and unable to feed their families and a secure work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahvazi suffer poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a large part of Iran's living Arab Ahvazi community, has been killed by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to maintain their habitation of local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz took over a mainly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took over in 1925 great effort to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran next oil and gas fields as well as some of the most portable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to remain slowly, and the local population gets just little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused to adopt the Ahvazi Arabs systematically jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a variety of demons built into the Persian areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces was Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These demns have only led to destroy the devastation of destruction in the region, and the local agriculture, as well as the fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">Unemployment rate under the Arab Ahawzi youth rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for cooperative, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahvazis that completed a work, completed the elementary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahazi-Human Rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," a "high rise" of sumorden under the young Ahvazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse and worse. reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ahwaz newly-coming ethnic group and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since function and institutions prefer non-Arabic workers, the local Arab Ahvazi will have access to business opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regimes which aims to destroy the spirit of national ancipality of young Araber, and they will earn their habitation outside their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their firstfruits and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahvazi, as well as Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace, because the speaking of Arab language, or the moist Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the given circumstances which, the Arab Ahvazi have to carry out human rights activists, before the situation explosives.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with the feminism, also with the intersectionals"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the position that was posted by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was subject of several discussions that many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am no Feministin, many women react in particular white women to record themselves as a sectional feminists - with frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wander, why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even raised scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminized * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money than men, despite the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">However, women still have under strenger observations when it's about to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still attributable to ensure women or later in various areas of life to a smooth cover, and discrimination based on gender equality still across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I'm convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come on skin color, on racism, on black women, black women in the LGBTIQ congregation, or black women from the Diaspora; when I had to mention, both in and outside the feminist movement, disconnect many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all of them that women should come together to get women - all women - come together to sing "their voices and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing" to reach the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">However, they don't want to talk about sexual violence in addition to sexual motivated violence that we are subject to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or in addition, black women and women of other ethnicities and Herccommodation price less deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are trained with a migration background more often than white girls, due to obvious integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spar and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">In one way, I want all women, all males and all men each man have any skin color; on the other hand, I can't consider ourselves as a black woman, who refused to take effect on both gender as well as on the skin of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and I'm not going to battle my refuge in a white-feminist-oriented Sphäre, which me and countless black women always has rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner did his speech in their speech: "I am no wife?" and I also refuse me to maintain a ideology at the black woman in a historic view of a simple and marginalised nature.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse me to join me in addition to cultural inclines our customs and customs service to prescribed their egoeccentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to bear white women the importance of skin color and gender quotation. for some of them will continue to kill the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional Feminism was formed in order to spend a home of different origin and renounces away from white feminism, still the word "Feminism" is still in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I go before, fully release me full and completely from Feminism, to put my coat for my dark skin and my status as wife, instead of me for a white feminist paradigm, which is so tough, that Intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define the black women after our own performances and give us to the Sphärenary, which are created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the Buches Africana Thurselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves through our own kind, and not only the - black women can be converted to this way, in which the cultural, spiritual, seelian, physical and even spiritual elements can be found, which make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately shall be called separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, please inform them about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this Paradigm existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized due to my dark skin and because of my Dasone as part of this Paradigmas.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in a environment where my life has neither exceeded, still ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa to make us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his congregation.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay," by Kurz. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# hericheinefrauam), who talked about the forest-over against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A Police Commissioner said Ada Bávez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, who had become a partner that had become active in comparison to a violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship had something time, and the police said, her statement would be laid on the acute, but more could not do.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena was shown for mistreatment, you also benefited the admonary display of Ada Bávez.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife moved back to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Violence against women break against women, is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women appear at all once, they will not receive any support at the State Court.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women have also dependent the financial assets of men, which they misuse. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence to be at all in the prosecution of prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content and Statistics and Statistics 2 Invisible misuse and legal system that nothing undershimmt3 Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It's hard to be found such as many women really abuse, says Myrian González, Researcher for geneys on Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports, but not even answering the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 at the District Court of Prosecution 9600 publishers for domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements in the police came by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace of peace. 86% of all women come from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements 40% of women that they were harassed physical abuse, 55% of women spoke of psychic misuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi will appear only a few of these offenders. "on every woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">For each woman who refunded to physical misuse, come two women who do not do, declared it at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Because women's suicide in Paraguay is not a personal offense, the prosecution will not be noted, as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Up to August 2016, journalists spent at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Coordinator for human rights in Paraguay, documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">After their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies a woman due to violent actions.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible misuse and a legal system, which undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the fixed girlfriend of Carlos Vera, it's insisted that she called his name of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning they didn't wanted to do this, but after that. this should be for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. but for two years the psychological force took part in one of the most common forms of violence against women, and at the same time the most severe:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never have thought that I would have been victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read before it, I thought that that just happens women to be submarinated because they are violent in violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen that.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana arranged social media to report about the mistreation by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions to Facebook, where they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told them how he had isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people said to their contributions, including Carlos even. he asked if he had raised the hand against them, and refused to be advised that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why did they leave the so long of Carlos, and left him not before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost so, they wanted to say that victims of abuse had to have a certain co-school.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who were not born in Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay in order to prove their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo ("I believe you,") that consists of women, all in any sort of abuse of Misuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk with other than their experience, listening to one another and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">You do that which many other do not do: they will take the end to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case, everything began with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince them that it was valuable.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias displays the authorities remained without the results and also of their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against their former partner, which developed into an unbreakthrough legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was primarily by money, power and influence of their former Partners.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The abuse of abuse is a way full of resistors and a fight against corruption in justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, an representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also looks great problems with the use of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Fürth).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Less.) are part of a campaign on Twitter using the Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law sees Femdomid to explain to a standalone offences and hardening as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature was changed in some points to win the members of the law, that the way for discriminalization of abortions, the current in Paraguay is basically prohibited and punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had provided, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs which have to bear the victims of violence even though they simply have to receive only display and secure accommodation, to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argumented that the law is not effective if the legislature doesn't have sufficient financial resources for this:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, Misuse is seen as a part of a human relationships.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjite Warrier 2016 in Zambia, shown with his understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa becomes extremely rare or even mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that is addressed to one of the most urgent need of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need of medical research there are two reasons: for a lack of global health care, many medicines and vaccines required to cover the special medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread in the poorest countries of Africa far more graving effects than anderswo, and lack investments for the research of these diseases are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists have been carried out in Africa. a major role of science and technology can be handled for the economic growth of the continent only.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for research of infectious disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s at Lusaka, Zambia just than the AIDS epidemic first graft effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he worked on the HIV-virus, before he decided to go home back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and over misunderstanding of the media on this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research assignment?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjite Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I supposing the sambische national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just launch a research program for development of molecular genetic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion about the important scientists in your country and general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research for basic research. we just put solutions for what it has been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay receivers, rather than to be macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often not usable in our neighbourhood, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where is the financing and support?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it enough?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult, it is suitable to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It's difficult to find people to return or come here, because the financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles there are in your routine research, which you haven't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure is not equal to the standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it will take months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interested but only a very limited understanding of science methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods must be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your mind after the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on how and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the Potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is demand in special scientific education, starting in every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploring the world's health (non-transmitted diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine are very beneficial.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: you can describe the pros and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is limited to do things, and access to scientific expertise, which represent the challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the United States to India: how "Open Source" Substances will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which is reported about solvents for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred in the USA in the USA in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as outlining, the first plant which has been built by NASA astronauts in space and has been honoured.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years of work, Mortons had been doing just through its own disinfection and the question as many salads who can get the boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he felt that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to bred more for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only available for single varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last years, more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cereal or tifleet types. due to this trends, plant breeding and nonfiction for food security ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">Morton, as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still needs to salad, but it needs longer than ever since his work is still more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when I lie in a river a rocky rock in order to settle the skull.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to move it now, but it is a fraction with the breeding tradition, "says he." I think this patents are too far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand before the court, no one can bred more than a new salads because all features are patented. "he makes so well as possible and tempted to rify those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and hard to use, no material is being protected as a intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">In addition, it is also connected to a movement that is always in the USA and everywhere in the world, Open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeds).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS, red Roman salad of the Sorte Outredama in the "Greenhouse" station is bred and eaten. there will be tested, whether plants can be built in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name is rather than sounds, than the movement originate from the IT area and not from the range of plants.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" -Saatgut) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software, which provides alternatives to urrect-protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and so for vegetarian use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, just OSSI, we can obligate US breeders to use that others may be able to use chatted Saatgut free of them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they can do not continue with their seeds and can sell it. "open source" breeder can only buy others to cross it, and it is not immediately appearing - two aspects that are banned by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Düstere outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">In the emeritus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to bred new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">It is well-related to him a role in larger problems such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or just little bit by using seed resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stressed that the "open-source" movement doesn't work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patched, whether vegetables, grain, genetically, or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to buy our goal of ecological projects, such as it is aimed at peasant markets, such as it is cultivated to peasant markets, such as this vegetables is cultivated, threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative is obligatory to provide other its seed-well-free. thus, their provision is in contrast to it, seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-Unterstützer argumble that the future of food supplies endanger, since the available Genpool is due to increasingly available spiritual property rights, which is therefore increasingly available, unablily delighted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of OSSI, has a doctorate in her doctoral thesis in carrots and their availability. she found out that roughly a third of all tiring features is protected as a spiritual property, making it not usable for plant breeding either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not such an estimated, but experts such as Luby gluten that massacres of cultivation plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visionist</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they are targeted - of such, due to their flavor or their colour improves up to such, due to them in certain environments, such as shackles or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties reveals that the available plant material for breeder over more patents are currently being necessary than ever before, as the changed terms due to climate change have been foreseeable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-intercherin Carly Scaduto, indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos and collaboration with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it is contradicted that intellectual property names, as "patents and the protection of plant varieters innovations." "a patent is taken in the basically a plan that can follow the patent as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these statements will help with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such kind of such protection is not that innovation, but promotes them by using the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: 20 years waiting for a patent, certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to wait for plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one could have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources still has been a general good and still remains: "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetizers are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make landing your work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That's it all, and it will be impossible to us if we don't want to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In all, Morton has impacted Morton to the concept, plant features: "we created the characteristics not really self.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Plants make it themselves out and as a breeder, we finally have no idea of doing what plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "who bred a worthence, so also his own values are in them in.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with large fibors and monocultures, herbicide, herbulation can be bred into its varieties such concept by agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly?.</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium businesses (such, which move on international markets, but smaller than such as Monsanto) patents have to reject it, even without patents, either reject it, or hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant-resistant Frank Morton is looking for Salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by the avoiding of plant patents: "it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I always need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors are able to sell my varieties in a few years himself, "says he." with a patent for 20 years ago it is being protected from competition, wherewith one of my opinion it really makes. "worldwide Resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seem to be a breeding in the "Open Source" breeder, but the concept spreads out quickly all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the center for Sustainable agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable agriculture), which describes itself as professional organization in the resources, a" open source "seed program works with farmers work and helps them to provide new varieties that satisfy certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them, on "Open Source" -Saatgut to come and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organisation has been working on a "Open Source" license which ultimately finally became a formal and legal binding form of OSSI obligation for breeder in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for the breeds differ from country to country, so that the OSSI Syndrome is not easy to use one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission announced that conventional plants could not be patented. thus, she speaks to the current practice of the European Patent amts, patents on conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">A statement is still no law, but now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to put this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference to "Open Source" conference facilities and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and conference companies from all East Africa to find something about the "Open Source" recovery motion and the global trend towards the sponsor of Saatos.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for "Open Source" -Saatcredited systems that the organization is currently making a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed trade systems for the scheduled next year of the official grid.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international Nonprofit development organization USC Canada and the action group - Action Group on Ecorrosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, global Alliance for the Future of Food, global Alliance for the future of Food - a composite and from support organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and another - a report that farmers have to come to seed and improve the seed policy, making a stable power supply with food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report also, the importance of a varied, local power supply with seeds for sustainable food systems are emphasised - a connection to recognize that by the Luby of OSSI hope it will be able to see him more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods have played especially in particular, where and like something is being built, and Saat." we now try to know people that know more behind their food. "</seg>

<seg id="2730">Well, the blog, which he established himself to perish at the Egyptian government, itself the aim of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which also heated to Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, was arrested almost 500 days in captivity, after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces, during which he reported on the student of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article are mainly due to politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment posted ziada with the government and reflecting what this means that this means:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to unlocked is very old, but has not priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the plump of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, so it is for me for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is managed to give me the feeling of a siege control; an arrest, uncovered murder, pre-charge of the national Security Council, the locking of blogs as well as any other website, for whom I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I didn't understand otherwise. in other words, my words have influence, if also on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used to go to the position of articles to renew the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him locked, and they were afraid of words, I can still change the link or a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mule go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) unlocked Egyptian government from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>

<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12th of June, we noticed how the rehearings of websites that offer VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">A such practice indicates the intention of government to block, continue to block content and filing to access the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is in addition, the situation decides to be locked behind locked doors, thereby reducing the Egyptian population and no legal basis, by calling them against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack them as next?</seg>

<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization, called Global Justice, called to intervene the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these are all daily and this is inacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So, the detailed report on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16, the Editorial article "This is not normal," in which it announced, a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>

<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a warbriy in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the paper was declared that the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro is 843 territories which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">It is aware that a war of war when he is distorted, also it can be used, cruel the police, which first shoot and then questions, to be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of Mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the name "War" more than them be supported?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the News portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist in Cecil Brasil, the journalist developed as "War" as a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could be shot, responsible for calculating the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
