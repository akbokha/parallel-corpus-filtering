that is James R@@ isen .
they might know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Pri@@ zes as New York Times .
long before someone had heard from Edward Snow@@ den , wrote R@@ isen a book where he published the N@@ SA illegal phones by Americans .
but it is another chapter , which should leave a permanent impression .
in this article , he describes a dis@@ ast@@ rous US intelligence service in which the CIA was liter@@ ally bom@@ b for an atom@@ ic bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , you read it .
it is an incredible story .
but don &apos;t you know , to whom the chapter is not afraid ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government filed against R@@ isen and calls him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he was used for the symbol of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condem@@ n journalists and journalists .
according to WW@@ I , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right when media is not able to protect this information and to protect the identity of the Mu@@ ch .
so , when the government of R@@ isen , he did something that had many cour@@ age@@ ous rep@@ orter did before him : he refused , and told that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , only days before the process , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they have a year for years , it was ind@@ isp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the demands of the government dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring , the rep@@ orter and sources are always lower .
instead of too bad and cr@@ ises to say , that can also make his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and thus , the investig@@ ators , without understanding , his phone calls departed to his home .
similarly , as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its loan agreements , and even travel expenses with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , that is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke at his attack , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead , the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary claims more than any US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government had too much too much of her work as ge@@ heim .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security , the result was that a W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to journalists .
so we put the press work on the game that will be protected by the first Constitutional laws , because the government has always have more possibilities to add all out .
but as the technology of the government allows to disp@@ ute the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and though , they can record from the moment to record , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the testimony .
today , communication software that it isn &apos;t yet called , when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is considerably more saf@@ er than normal E @-@ ma@@ ils or telephone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s most famous Aaron Sw@@ artz , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of an e @-@ mail to em@@ end you go on a news site , such as the Washington Post here .
you can download documents or information , like with any ordinary contact form .
these will be encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the telec@@ omm@@ unications agency has received .
so , the government cannot be described more information about , and many of the information that would like to request it would be not available .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the dance to protect the Press Freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments over the world always new sp@@ ion@@ line technologies that are all end@@ ang@@ ered .
it &apos;s to ensure that not only technology enthusi@@ astic like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to protect iniqu@@ ities . it is also important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
who wants to report about de@@ ers by soldiers of compl@@ aint and from over@@ filled hosp@@ itals . or the next environmental employees , the alarm to the se@@ ated water of Flin@@ t pro@@ poses . or a pilgri@@ m @-@ Insider that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect your constitu@@ tional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the greatest dat@@ alog@@ y of the history was published . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; this week we have been sent by messages via a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s lawyer County Mos@@ bag Fonseca
the publication of this documents for@@ gives a small in@@ sight into the secret world of star@@ o@@ ases .
we will receive an impression of it , how customers , banks and law@@ yers to companies like Mos@@ bag Fonseca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anon@@ ymous company . can you set it ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ ma@@ ils , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has st@@ epp@@ ed .
also there are reports that a ally of the brut@@ al Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ash@@ ar al @-@ Assad ro@@ omm@@ ates in tax @-@ phases .
it is claimed that a trail of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s president Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of kids , one famous cel@@ lists .
now there is a lot of many people and others to wait for the next release , and wait for the next release documents .
now sounds like the plot of a agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ novel .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , unusual people .
why should we ask what ?
but the truth is : if the rich and M@@ ighty are able to hide their assets in tax o@@ ases , and not all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets .
and that about us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world discuss media and leading polit@@ icians , such as secret tax o@@ ases of some few are used to hide its assets and wear something that we have been discuss@@ ing for ten years .
I think many people appears very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these star@@ ters work .
I always make it like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one company has one company in another firm , in another company what it makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult for pro@@ secu@@ tions and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society to understand what thing is .
I also find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter .
to pres@@ um@@ ably , because there was no more promin@@ ent Americans that came into this dis@@ closure of the sc@@ and@@ al .
now it is not so that there is no real American citizens to hide its fort@@ une in star@@ fish .
but by the principle , after which these star@@ ters work , Mos@@ bag has fewer American customers .
we would have a privacy of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to see connections in the USA .
indeed , it is so that one needs more information in some US states must have less information , to establish a company as a library of a library .
this type of in@@ transparent in the United States has allowed to re@@ b@@ ate school children .
it also has been permitted to re@@ b@@ ate especially challeng@@ ed tra@@ ilers .
it is this type of behaviour that affects us all .
here with Global Wit@@ ness , we &apos;ll need to figure out how to see all this in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a discovered investig@@ ators into the offices of 13 inc@@ ur@@ ative firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as African ministers , who wanted to bring the susp@@ ects money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all by up to our investig@@ ator suggest@@ ions , how he could transfer his money .
these were all regulations . None of these law@@ yers took us as cli@@ ffs , and of course it was handed over to us . but it shows the problem with this system .
it &apos;s also important to consider it not as a single falls .
it does not go to have one individual lawyer , under@@ lined our dis@@ cover@@ ies suggest@@ ions .
it does not go to a single top pol@@ itic , managed in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it &apos;s about how the system works to be established through the cor@@ ruption , tax acc@@ us@@ ation , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to handle this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this type of behaviour .
this may sound very soft sin@@ ners , as if we could do nothing ; as if nothing could have changed , as if there is always the rich and M@@ ighty beings .
but as an interpre@@ ter , I see that it began to change itself .
in the last few years we have seen prec@@ au@@ lic@@ ences to more transpar@@ ency what the owners of companies rel@@ ates .
the theme found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has recorded in central regist@@ ers at national level , who really is behind firms in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the U.S. is left .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both par@@ li@@ aments , but this does not make the progress , we would like to see .
we would like to see how this Panama dis@@ closure , this gig@@ antic in@@ sight into the world of tax o@@ ases , used as a means to help in the US and globally for more transpar@@ ency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need common people who are mot@@ hers when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ store .
we need ex@@ ecu@@ tives in the economy that are up and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot;
we need leading polit@@ icians that recognize the problem and use it to end the laws of the in@@ transpar@@ ency .
in addition , we can finally put the in@@ transpar@@ ency that still enables these kind of tax acc@@ ursed , cor@@ ruption and money .
this is the story how I was almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I had finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard of birth .
a guy in the red Mazda stand and looked for my things .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and went straight a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to peace @-@ sc@@ or@@ ps .
I lu@@ d him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was ti@@ red .
while we paid the bill , I made it to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just knew him only ! he says , he would not know for peace sk@@ ill@@ ets , but I don &apos;t know whether he is really plans . I don &apos;t kid@@ n@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small car boot !
then I heard me : &quot; I have a mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; say , &quot; How please ? &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I fixed to the blank@@ et and thought : &quot; Oh dear , what was I dried up ?
a game of hits in my living room .
what if he is mad ? &quot;
I got an such fear that I went out of the bed , on a tenth points to the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
the art works that he had bought from me , is hang@@ ed today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has been my eye angle completely changed .
perhaps people who were sold to me as a stran@@ ger than a stran@@ ger , actually friends who were only waiting for us to be discovered ?
people at my Air Matt@@ ress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the Air Matt@@ ress .
we make a leap years , two years later ...
I am un@@ employed , almost ple@@ dge , my co @-@ inhabitants is attrac@@ ts and the rent is increased .
I told that there were a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , cre@@ ativity can be able to trans@@ form an@@ xi@@ ety in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow citizens Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I &apos;ve got something to earn something about it . our apartment will be able to have a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded the Air Matt@@ ress and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the Air Matt@@ ress of wood .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ etts is completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , star@@ s@@ ten Brian and I joined us .
had just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
the things came to roll .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ates , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to figure whether you could make it a business concept .
we presented the investors : &quot; we wish to create a web site , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are closed when visit .
then , on the Internet , they can invite it to some of them to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the ro@@ cket was ro@@ cket .
but they did not do .
no one who is yet very close at Tro@@ st would invest in a business , the stran@@ ger allowed in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned as children have learned that stran@@ ger are dangerous .
if you have a problem , it concerns of things that can be good . we could be able .
at the art academ@@ y we learned that design is much more than just a look and Hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to create objects from design@@ ing objects , but now we wanted to create cutting through design , between people who had never met before .
can design therefore aff@@ ord something ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
I want to give you a KO@@ ST@@ PRO@@ BE , which degree trust we .
it is a 30 @-@ second experim@@ ent . it is extrac@@ ted out of your complex@@ ion .
th@@ um@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I &apos;d like to make you un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
this silent flight from pan@@ ic which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when it open the first time the door .
for the only thing that is still personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your text , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stran@@ ger ?
most feel the responsibility .
so , most guests , if they have a different stay .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just once , who has now actually Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could you tell Twitter announced that he is the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have experienced , what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you some dis@@ cover@@ ies .
what would , if we have changed a small detail in this experim@@ ent ?
what if your neigh@@ bor revealed only once with his name ; if he would have been told , where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , they have 150 addresses , who say all say , &quot; He can really lock@@ locked all phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you need to leave your phone ?
because a well @-@ known feedback system strength@@ ens trust in a well @-@ known feedback system .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people who add negative imp@@ acts .
ulti@@ mat@@ ely decided to wait for both the hosts as well as guest performances , before we set them online .
last week we have discovered something new .
we conducted with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how it is likely that people trust in each other , as much as they are regarding the age and residence .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly , we trust the people most , most of us are most similar .
the more differences we find , the more do we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ domin@@ ance .
exciting , when you add the call of one person -- in our case by arrangement .
if you have less than three names , nothing changes .
but it has more than ten , changed everything .
a good rep@@ utation of the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the correct design can help us to over@@ coming some of our deep attemp@@ ts to overcome .
moreover we drove that trust is dependent on how much man is che@@ aper .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
for example , if you &apos;re talking about how , &quot; hi ! &quot; you gets no answer .
tells you too much as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted .
so there is also an optimal grade to op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; T@@ olle art works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design , to make this degree on op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of tex@@ ture to recommend the correct amount text . we also give tips to which them@@ es you should write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the correct design can help to overcome our advantages from stran@@ gers .
so that we had not counted , the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay these prec@@ eding parts .
here you see how many people are eligible to take our offer .
you can see three things .
erst@@ ens : incredi@@ bly good luck .
second@@ ly : the inno@@ cent work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
the shop is just very good for us .
of course there are times , if not it runs fine .
there were guests who celebrated un@@ allowed parties or fl@@ ats .
host hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stood in front of the front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing wr@@ ong@@ es as these calls . it is already a wo@@ e when I think just remember it .
the dis@@ appointment , which one hear in the voice of the anus , and will always be our biggest motiv@@ ation to improve us .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , out of the 123 million people , only a fr@@ action had a problem .
cause people tru@@ sted to one another .
if trust works , can be done mir@@ acles .
one of our guests enjoyed holiday in Uruguay , where he suffered a heart attack .
his host went into the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travel@@ ers , due to sitting on heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hosp@@ itals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real protection levels that save one life , even though they don &apos;t know any properly .
they sail to the hospital when you dies , and wait until you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel themselves , they bring books .
you can stay even longer stay , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , do not running every stay .
but these relation@@ ships behind pure money trans@@ itions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I was about this term , I asked me :
how does the thought of the section with money trans@@ actions be together ?
it is here around a economic trade .
but it &apos;s just to name &quot; Rental industry , &quot; the cause is not just@@ ified .
Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relation@@ ships .
people put a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if you &apos;re re@@ warded to compare it is efficient and reliable , but it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what would be a rich buffet from local income ?
what would be if in any place to visit a group there , a group there was a thorough@@ ly dis@@ appearance and one at a Kn@@ ei@@ pen@@ wolf neighborhood , which one has never heard .
or if you get cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to privacy .
what would , if we would like to create apartments from the reason ?
how would it look like ?
what would you have to accept the thoughts from mut@@ ual ?
I would like to give me cities , who permit us and relation@@ ships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ formation .
the project already started in South Korea in Seoul , with lots of car parks , which belonged to the government ,
now they were offered to residents , students that were looking for a lead .
men were killed in people whose children have gone out . there were incub@@ ated programs have started ,
in order to reach new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , 785 000 people are charged in 191 countries with a stran@@ ger or even host .
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it has been taught us .
we won &apos;t re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also already before .
there were already similar sites in front of us .
so why did we just work ?
apart from luck and tim@@ ing , we realized that you can find the correct design that you can find the correct design .
design can help us to overcome the frozen prec@@ eding parts .
I find the flower ,
over@@ whel@@ m@@ ingly over@@ whel@@ m@@ ingly .
I have to think about it , if a red Mazda starts to me .
we don &apos;t know that design can &apos;t solve every problem .
but when it could help us when it had this great influence , I ask myself what we will soon be able for design .
thanks .
what do you think when you see me ?
a cred@@ itor ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain under@@ wear , a terror attack ?
or just a delay in the security box at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
so the media are regarded as I look like .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans know that most would not have Muslims .
probably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who never have to know a Muslims : it is great , you know @-@ making .
I tell you who I am .
I &apos;m a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am turned away ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a pract@@ ising , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to have decided .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as hom@@ osex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to bear Hi@@ j@@ ab , my Head@@ piece .
my femin@@ ist friends were kid@@ neys : &quot; why did you feel yourself ? &quot;
the rust@@ y was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Independence , namely , opposite the print , I felt like 17 @-@ year @-@ old , me a perfect and un@@ able beauty in@@ spiration .
I haven &apos;t just missed the faith of my parents .
I have got with the cor@@ ruption .
I read it , thought after , marked in question , dou@@ b@@ ted and believed .
my relation to God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ ot@@ ion , which deep@@ ens with every reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ m brings me sometimes up to we@@ eping .
I &apos;m sorry for myself . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel the feeling that som@@ eb@@ ody you perc@@ ei@@ ve it , and any@@ how do you love it ?
so it fe@@ els .
later I started and started when all of the good Egypti@@ ans , my career as engineers .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then that terri@@ ble morning came in September 2001 .
many of you remember , exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had at the end he had served at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Express &quot; .
there was smoke , air@@ planes fle@@ w in buildings , people suffering from the buildings .
what was it ?
a accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock transformed quickly in in@@ dig@@ nation .
why should I do something ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam &quot; ... , &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... J@@ ih@@ ad M@@ ek@@ ka ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country has been attacked , but in the N@@ ay re@@ bu@@ ked me the acts of others from a civil war in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new town and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember that -- as we arrived - so deep it went into my seat place , and I was fe@@ ared to be the first time as Muslims .
we moved to this night in our apartment , in a new town , in which it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; Be aw@@ ak@@ ening , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful in well lit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed all the week .
it was then open on Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to a prayer .
and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive range of coverage .
the fe@@ el@@ ings were conf@@ ection@@ able un@@ filtered and I heard also of attacks on Muslims , who held at the free err@@ illas and stroke the Muslims .
there were really surf breaks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt really felt .
because people who had attacked this land , had attacked our country .
I have chosen the rage of people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was too angry .
it is not easy to describe themselves .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the acc@@ us@@ ations which are hard .
today we can listen to people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when are we going to go ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims and Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my congregation , like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or good ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a gut@@ arti@@ cul@@ t tumor . just under observation .
the altern@@ atives are mean@@ ing@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ or and Teacher , First Light and Olympi@@ on@@ ics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America saf@@ er ?
there is perhaps a few parking lots , but not stop the terror .
regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to consider people of other faith toler@@ ant , and larger civil participation .
and as a head of the police in the Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not in Mos@@ ques radi@@ ates .
you will be ra@@ dic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
during the radi@@ cal process , it has found that he is online . as the first , the person receives a brain processes even by their family , that the person believes , the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ass@@ ed their behaviour and their ide@@ ology .
if we want to prevent Radi@@ c@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group formed like the IS their brood with the cor@@ relation .
as Muslims , as a mother , when human being , I believe that we must do all to stop a group as the IS .
but we would like to add us to their ordin@@ ation world when you recognized them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christian@@ ity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but when one look at them , it does not drives them what they are in their &quot; Holy Scri@@ p@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brood @-@ ality , which they can read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me a amazing story :
a girl came to him , because she promised to join the IS .
I was really sur@@ prised and asked him if they have been in contact with radi@@ cal religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy to whom she spoke , she brought them to silence , and told her , that their wrath was for un@@ righteousness in the world , they only would be trouble in trouble .
from nothing is inspired and something that would have been given to their blood , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation of extrem@@ ists who pursu@@ ed a solution .
this im@@ am turned the connection to God and their congregation .
rather than to acc@@ use her blood , he showed their construc@@ tive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept them before the IS .
this was an in@@ sight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it impact on each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of an@@ xi@@ ety every day on our democracy , on our thought of thoughts ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ cular studies -- if we fear us , at least three things happen .
we accept a aut@@ onomous government system , con@@ formity and advantages .
a study shows : if you were reported to test reviews , in which there were negative over Muslims , they agreed to have more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ cision of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic issue .
if you look , when the atmosphere Ag@@ athe against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror .
it happened in the front of the war in Iraq and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it actually can be a tool for man@@ ip@@ ulation to the public to identify the foundation of a free society that sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
the dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the tox@@ ic@@ onic air of fear sent us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , it does not only need to declare themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was in the dental fac@@ ulty , tal@@ ented , very promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , gener@@ ous man to knew her .
she visited him there , and he showed her living . she was bl@@ ossom and said :
&quot; when is from my brother such a experienced young man ? &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Suz@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was assass@@ inated in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment as with a execution of Muslims left on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also f@@ atal .
so back to the start .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mos@@ que or we stayed at home ?
we practi@@ ced it and for us , there was no slight decision because we would like that America would like to check our children : one that would be able to check us through fear , or , in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose us for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we left silent , with high pressure on the mos@@ que .
I took him out , and my shoes came out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , he left me .
the hall was rest@@ less .
then , the im@@ am an announcement , th@@ ank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because the half of the gathered together were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , belie@@ ver and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us but to teach us .
at that moment I have been collap@@ sed .
these people were there , because they had cour@@ age and encour@@ age pan@@ ic and lectures .
what will you choose ?
what will you dial in the moment of fear and Fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you go to number secure ?
or will they close to those who are my : we are better than that .
thanks a lot .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a Ner@@ v .
but I wonder what do you say that you might remember a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mem@@ orial with dr@@ au@@ ght , in a noble mon@@ uments , thus one exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not say . I am entirely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m so unusual as it is allowed .
if you can look at the Muslims all over the world , and I did all the world &apos;s largest performed study on all over the world , people want to know people normal things .
they want me well @-@ known for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no respect for any one .
if people appear to appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what a platform for DIY began , is about to become a milli@@ ar@@ den@@ ers .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drugs . possible , it is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air par@@ cel delivery in our social consci@@ ousness , an aut@@ onomous fleet of aviation machines in France has built a six metre high tower in front of 1 500 pul@@ ler . some years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es .
a high speed and acceleration in the smallest space is connected by connecting rooms .
you can also build an independent structures .
they have learned to bear trucks , to t@@ ack@@ le with tur@@ bul@@ ences and generally responded to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the bound@@ aries of the possibility of aut@@ onomous flight .
in order to works a system of aut@@ onomous , it must be collective bar@@ ei@@ d where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the E@@ TH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic loading .
for today &apos;s dem@@ os we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laborat@@ ories .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in room , calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available at the highest eb@@ e . e.g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; lan@@ den . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight unit that tries to beat two flying with a fl@@ ap .
like other star@@ fish , it is efficient , a much more efficient than helicop@@ ter in all her variations .
in contrast to most Star@@ r@@ vol@@ fi@@ bers it can be floating , and has a great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a m@@ iter site .
a limitation of rear bum@@ ps is that they re@@ act more sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ences such as wind ar@@ ches .
we develop new controls and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea is behind that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter the optimal position , and the performance can be improved through practice .
okay .
during our research , we are often preparing a fundamental abstr@@ act issues related to the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about machines with thousands of moving parts that merg@@ ed themselves to bre@@ ach you .
decades ago , the pilots were fully remote controlled flight machines , which had only two floating parts : a propeller , and a tail boom .
we discovered that flies can only work with just one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est flight machine . it was recently invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a propeller ,
no cl@@ ap , hing@@ es and diagonal surface , no further actuators or controls , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the inner living there is much , so that it can be stable , and can move in the room .
non@@ eth@@ eless , it does not have an elegant Alg@@ orith@@ m of the stern star@@ ters . to bring it to flies , I have to throw it perfectly .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood , it &apos;s right to throw , if all look to me is low , therefore , what I shot you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ ius , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what do you do with all this over@@ flow ?
you see that he is not balanced .
therefore it is ambi@@ val@@ ent in his align@@ ment .
in this way , he will receive the great ability ,
in space for all directions , no matter what is turned in direction , or even as he is rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ell@@ ers .
the rema@@ inder can be ordered in models , the rest will be learned directly at feeding .
let us see that .
when flying machines will be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin @-@ propeller aircraft engines .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a engine or propeller falls out , the electronics or a battery - can continue to fly the machine if even restricted .
we will be able to demonstrate that we will make a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration was synth@@ etics to be synthetic .
the great number of aut@@ onomous , coordin@@ ated units enables a pal@@ let of aest@@ hetic expression .
we took the usual micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and fit them with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorith@@ ms .
every unit is white , where the room is and is self @-@ controlled . so there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully motiv@@ ate these demonstr@@ ations to think new revolutionary ideas .
on Broadway a fly lamp would like to practice a fly lamp@@ shade .
of course , it &apos;s difficult to anticip@@ ate the influence of these technology .
for types like us lies the sal@@ ary in the development and the rh@@ age .
it is as a reminder , as wonderful and en@@ chan@@ ting our universe , and that it is creative , they are able to re@@ cover them in such a spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has been sol@@ ves mas@@ sively and economic potential , is the bag on the i .
thanks a lot .
nearly 1.3 billion years ago , in a very wide dist@@ ant galax@@ y two black holes always faster , they walk to the mass of three sun in a tenth of pure energy .
these short moment they sh@@ ining bright as all stars together in all galax@@ ies , across the whole of us .
it was a very big boy .
their energy they didn &apos;t replace them in the form of light , --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ ellen .
we first found the events in time .
nearly 1.3 billion years ago , just a wide range of life was created on the earth .
since then the Earth has brought forth : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Saul , people , and -- God arise , even the internet .
in front of approximately 25 years ago , a group especially Mu@@ es@@ -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser detector , to search for gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ als , which arise around by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people acknowle@@ dged them as a mad gene , so the U.S. National Science Foundation contributed their idea .
following the decades of development , design , conc@@ eption and extremely much har@@ der work they built the detector LI@@ GO : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ an ob@@ serv@@ atory .
in the following time , precision of LI@@ GO could significantly increase what the detection rate improved considerably .
this is why the Advanced LI@@ GO is called .
at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was launched for a last test run to clar@@ ify some minor , difficult problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commission@@ ing of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ als of the two col@@ li@@ ti@@ fier black holes caused by the earth through the earth .
they went through and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two mom@@ ents in my life were emot@@ ional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well from my to@@ d@@ ill father .
in the bas@@ ically the fruits of my life were .
all this , what I worked , is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colle@@ ague Scott Hug@@ hes , theore@@ tic physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigated for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ als from black holes and their ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories such as LI@@ GO meas@@ ur@@ able signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ elle is a c@@ abling of space and time .
in front of the wave , the space and its entire content will be stretched to a direction and in the other hand .
for illustration , lec@@ tur@@ ers perform a correct al@@ ber@@ ing dance during the rel@@ atives of courses in courses .
&quot; stret@@ ching and dust , stret@@ ching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ation sw@@ are extremely weak , even more ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched by the waves and stretched . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . thus man explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already ab@@ sur@@ d , this length would have to be measured less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of the radius of an atom@@ ic core . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text by Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties of the building of such det@@ ectors are massive .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are invent@@ or , and with the support of the public will be overcome all obst@@ acles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
Back to LI@@ GO . Scott claims , LI@@ GO has been an ear than a eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than the things around us : face tags , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite convenient . for example , you can make a picture or a card of D@@ ingen , by using several points for the light around you .
at sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very hard , actually impossible to make a picture of d@@ ingen , which means you very much :
for the face of your child .
instead , we are sitting from specific properties like pitch and height , rhyth@@ m and volume to close the history .
&quot; now talking to Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ ellen .
we can &apos;t have any simple images of objects in the All .
but by changing to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies are in the hearing range for LI@@ GO .
so if we convert wave pattern into sound , we can listen to all liter@@ ally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation in lau@@ gh , we can adv@@ ise us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes that my colle@@ ague Scott already worked very long .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , circular round : w@@ up@@ p !
rotate the two body very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cu@@ s with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : WU @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a type of movement of movement , domin@@ ates into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget to hear this as a noise from -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which are about as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : if we consider , what does that mean .
two black holes , the di@@ vin@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ ands , the other with a mass of 36 sun , surrounded by a hundred times a second , before they were col@@ li@@ ged .
imagine that forces before .
fantastic .
and we know it , because we have heard it .
this is the lasting significance of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO eb@@ net a completely new way to explore the universe as she never had previously been possible .
we can listen to all listen and listen to the invisible .
much in all we can see -- practi@@ cally or generally -- do not see .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why do people explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the All .
the exciting physical process will be done in the core , which lies behind thousands kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon in the core .
we will never see it , because these op@@ ak are .
Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ an penet@@ rating iron , when it would be transparent glass . the ur@@ kn@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe . but we will never see it because of the world will be covered by his own night@@ lights .
using Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ sw@@ ellen , it should be possible to turn back until the beginning .
and probably the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see , and from which we have no idea . things we can only discover that we are listening .
in fact , LI@@ GO found equal to the first race things we didn &apos;t expect .
my colle@@ ague on MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars , the black holes caused by the black holes , are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so called the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen to our archaeological work .
LI@@ GO allows us a completely different angle of view to the events in all , to the emer@@ gence of the stars , and ulti@@ mat@@ ely , as we came out of this ch@@ aos .
AA : the challenge is now there , so encour@@ age to be possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and noise of the cos@@ mos of Kos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories on Earth and All .
for what could be nice when the ur@@ kn@@ ous itself too loud ?
now the time is great Dre@@ ams .
dream up with us .
thanks .
some time I tried a experim@@ ent .
one year would I say &quot; Yes ! &quot; say before I was afraid .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it was nerv@@ ous , me in un@@ pleasant situations , I have to say &quot; Yes &quot; .
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
what do I wanted to play with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fe@@ ared me , elim@@ inated my fe@@ ars .
my fe@@ ars , re@@ hear@@ ken to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of an word is impressive .
&quot; Yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; Yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly article . it began with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls from un@@ explained reasons all &quot; estim@@ ation , &quot;
it would be a wa@@ iter from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my sn@@ ap . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her , when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
one new way of life in my family . from there I sw@@ ore to me to play with them once you don &apos;t play with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
fast . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m trying to try me .
it has a magical effect on me , on my family .
but it also has a bl@@ ind@@ ed side effects : only recently , I really got the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ s@@ agen to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am auth@@ ored . I think of things , aw@@ ake to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produced television .
I have been doing television , in great style .
in this TV @-@ season I have responsible for that 70 hours of programme can go out into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that previously existed .
the budget for a epis@@ ode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new epis@@ ode all nine days for four shows , thus all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs , which simultaneously are four , 16 episodes simultaneously : sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series are running on Thursday night .
in the whole world , my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million vie@@ wers .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are ship@@ ments which I created myself , and not only produced , so still no ill , creative , creative time to gather my fans of bon@@ fi@@ res and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fi@@ res that burn around the world .
do you know who still makes it ?
no one , therefore I am a titanium .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
I tell it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you all of you that work so hard , whether you take a company , a country or a budget , so that I am not only at the computer , that you may say that I am not only at the computer , that it is true when I say : I understand that there is not a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all the work , everything that has blood , all swe@@ at -- no te@@ ars .
I have been working much , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened to work in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work is still a country dating from the Nich@@ ts .
it is when I set up troops in a painting , looking on a canvas .
as a dre@@ aming , one tall , fly a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically and advis@@ ing , funny and dis@@ rup@@ ting , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cru@@ el and sen@@ sible , and the best in it is the Sum@@ men .
there is such a change in me when work is good .
a s@@ ums starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the tot@@ als sounds like a bus@@ y road , I could go forever .
many people take on , if I tell them the Sum@@ men that I have explained in writing that the letter is prepared to me .
don &apos;t understand me that doing it .
but the Sum@@ men -- when I started with the television production when I began to work and re@@ construc@@ t , I discovered this cause , this Sum@@ men , this energy . the Sum@@ men !
the Sum@@ men is more than the writing .
the Sum@@ men is action and activity . the Sum@@ men is a drug .
the s@@ ums is music . the tot@@ als is light and air .
the tot@@ als is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a s@@ ums , then you can &apos;t move differ@@ ently than in size .
the feeling , not unlike any size , no matter how the price .
this is called the s@@ ums .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is Gen@@ ie .
maybe it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know it .
I know just that I &apos;m not at the failure , and I know just that I love the s@@ men .
I will tell you only , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want it in question .
to make a clear question : the more successful I , ever cap@@ abilities , more about more episodes , the more work there , the more work at the same time , the more time I write me , the more I write me history so much more expectations exist .
the more I work to work successfully , the more you have to work me .
and what I said about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men .
I like this s@@ ums . I love the s@@ ums .
I need the s@@ ums . I &apos;m the s@@ ums .
am I only that Sum@@ men ?
and then the s@@ ums stopped .
revised , over@@ st@@ ressed , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the s@@ ums stopped .
now my three daughters to the truth p@@ amp@@ ered that her m@@ om is a single @-@ one @-@ one @-@ Institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estim@@ ation , I want to go to Sh@@ onda . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ ic .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als were ceased .
the tot@@ als of the engine was driven .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was made .
the s@@ ums was not back .
my s@@ men was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ ic work , 15 hours @-@ days , working weekends , no re@@ ue , nothing deleg@@ ate , isn &apos;t enough , with a whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ men .
in me there was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview of Titan ,
everything was grey , I had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the Sum@@ men and the Sum@@ men .
so what makes you doing what you do , do the work that man love , suddenly do anything ?
I know , some may think : &quot; h@@ ay you out of the author of Titan . &quot;
but you know how to be doing , man loves to be a teacher , someone loves to be a teacher , a painter , Bill gates , and knows how to say the sum@@ ming even if you knew the s@@ ums when the tot@@ als stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still an Titan ?
if the song of my heart he@@ ars , I can sur@@ vive in silence ?
and then my &quot; South America winery &quot; is a question .
I am on the way to outside , late and she says : &quot; m@@ ama , do you play ? &quot;
and I will already say no more , than I will be aware of my things :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and second , she named me not &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
they call no more &quot; estim@@ ations . &quot;
when is it happen ?
I p@@ asse it , if I am Titan bin and my tot@@ als concrete , and it change all of my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; M@@ um , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; Yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and their sisters come down , we laugh@@ ing a lot and I read more dram@@ atically from the book &quot; Body Po@@ ops &quot; in front of them .
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in lack of sw@@ im , can I do nothing but to fit .
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I am quiet .
the land , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they exist no more .
all that there are stick@@ y fing@@ ers and dam@@ aging , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song , in which it comes to che@@ er , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; is los@@ ing .
all is peace and simp@@ licity .
the air on this place is so close that I hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
play the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something that is dissolved in me .
a mental door goes to and an energy feed comes down .
and that doesn &apos;t immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the Sum@@ men comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , but it is ready .
not the s@@ ums , but a s@@ ums .
and now I feel at me when I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s remain with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the tot@@ als that labour falls , the Titan@@ ens@@ um@@ men , that &apos;s only the subst@@ itute .
if I ask you , who , if I am going to help you , if I am resol@@ ved using ship@@ ments and TV hours and how working my brain , then I forget that the real Sum@@ men is .
the tot@@ als is no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on joy .
the real Sum@@ men is dependent on love .
the sw@@ men is the current to come from the life of life .
the real Sum@@ men is self @-@ consci@@ ousness and peace .
the real Sum@@ men are ig@@ no@@ red the pressure of history , which are exp@@ elled , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps talk to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , a lot more love .
once my child will play with me , I will tell Yes .
I &apos;m doing this for a fixed rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the s@@ ums .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in play , I don &apos;t like it .
they don &apos;t play any other way as working .
the truth do@@ w ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always have been working , for I love it .
I prefer the workplace as da@@ heim .
this conc@@ ession is pain@@ ful , because what a man is better than to be home to house ?
well yes , I am .
I &apos;m ehr@@ ily , I know Me &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relax@@ ed , is none of it .
we were around in the garden , before and back , and her .
we make small dance @-@ parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cut soap bub@@ bles .
I feel the greater part of stiff@@ ness , so conf@@ id@@ ent and conf@@ used .
I always read on my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the universe of universe is fulfilled .
I play and play , until I wonder : why did we have ever heard with the games ?
you can also say it ! say then Yes , if your child would like to play with you .
maybe you keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a dream designer .
there you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
they have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find less interesting when you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me , until they need to make something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but only 15 minutes away .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks were replaced .
and talking my te@@ ens daughter of all 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs .
everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even at a bad guy !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile , no laundry , any loss .
the day is short : d@@ inners , the children have been done .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
my children are my well @-@ feeling , my world . it must not be the children . it is to feel the sw@@ men to feel a place for his soul peace .
it does not go to games with their own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
around the &quot; games &quot; in general .
take the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find it out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m looking and I wins . friends meet , books , enjoy the day --
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; stand just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I wanted to make a titanium in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass me more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not full 15 minutes che@@ ers ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the s@@ ums come back in my leisure time . the tot@@ als seems to be back when I am not working .
work not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , and I find me again in my office . I hear a unknown t@@ une , it meets me and my soul . she po@@ inting me to new ideas . I use it into full breeding and love my work again .
I like the Sum@@ men , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men &apos;s not ... no more .
bub@@ bles and stick@@ y fing@@ ers , dinner with friends .
now this is my s@@ ums .
the s@@ ums of life .
the s@@ ums of love .
the tot@@ als of work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so thanks .
it is me , that I am a Titan bin . I never seen a Titan , who plays back to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the more happy are I and my children .
ever I play , the more fe@@ el@@ ings I feel good .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better work I .
the more I play , the more I hear the Sum@@ men . the country that I create , the marathon , whom I run , the troops , the high sound , the s@@ ums that tot@@ als , the other , the correct s@@ men : the Sum@@ men of life .
the more I think this s@@ men , the more makes this unusual ble@@ eding , naked and new life feeling in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I think , the more I know who I am .
I am auth@@ ored . I think of things I aw@@ ake to life .
this is a job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this jobs ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how to change your life from one second on the other side , after a serious stroke , or after an automobile accident .
for us neu@@ ro@@ surgery is it very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain is in contrast to other body organs , a very small ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious bre@@ ach of the central nerv@@ ous system , patients often have a lasting , severe dis@@ ability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor , tried to improve nerv@@ ous functions using different surgical measures .
surely , they have heard from one of the most popular ones , the &quot; underground ir@@ n@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; so im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the ne@@ ur@@ ons that impro@@ ves neurolog@@ ical function .
it &apos;s really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s milk , which suffered severe pain and severe pain .
Ne@@ uro @-@ mod@@ ulation doesn &apos;t mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neu@@ ro@@ surgery is the recovery of brain .
in my opinion , we appro@@ aches us this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with a little help , the brain can help yourself .
the story started 15 years ago .
at the time I was the chief physician and worked in the not@@ ary mark .
I often dis@@ missed patients with sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that the brain trau@@ ma @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a sh@@ aking the brain and the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure increase .
to save life , you have to reduce the sk@@ inn@@ ate pressure .
sometimes you need to remove a moder@@ ni@@ ated brain mass at times .
instead of the sw@@ ollen brain mass , we decided to analy@@ ze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist who analy@@ ze the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted cells rise from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
the cells of a ri@@ fl@@ ax@@ ed cells can be comparable to a small children that will be taken out of your families .
it is necessary to find the proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments .
just that we had to do with these cells .
after many attemp@@ ts , Jean @-@ François made it .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it just looked like a stem cell culture . by big green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells are surrounded by small and un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you are still know from the Biology to practice that tribe cells are un@@ ripe cells that can trans@@ form themselves in any cell type of organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is sur@@ prising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made a fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were slowly and after a few weeks , they still died .
so we saw a new , strange cell@@ population that looked like stem cells , but it was different .
we need long to understand how they came .
they are from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Double@@ c@@ ort@@ in positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large @-@ brain nr@@ w .
they play an important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they take care of the brain .
but why will they get us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participated in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentration camps near brain inju@@ ries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potenti@@ ally cell source that enables brain healing .
that had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experim@@ ent .
we wanted a piece of brain mass in the non @-@ language section and then the cells exactly so cultiv@@ ate as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then they are colored mark@@ edly to watch them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them to the de@@ position of the same individuals .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous tran@@ spl@@ ant -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splant@@ ation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ plant@@ able these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ plant@@ able the same cells in contact brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we couldn &apos;t work with keys .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they had been taken after some weeks , they go back home . the room is already owned , they are not used there , so van@@ ish them .
in the second scenario we met an inj@@ ury and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they grew up ne@@ ur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the proof which they show , are these small points . these are the cells that we are in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
we could not stop of course .
help these cells also to re@@ cover from a brain tissue inj@@ ury ?
so we exercise Mon@@ keys with a manual winding assignment .
they had to take fe@@ ather pellets of a tablet .
they made it very well .
when they achieved a stable level of sk@@ ill level , we achieved a mot@@ orized f@@ tex in motor@@ sport@@ y area .
thus , the monkeys were par@@ alys@@ ed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen if people would happen , they re@@ bu@@ ked spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , exactly as after a stroke .
patients are par@@ alys@@ ed and then try to get with the help of plastic brain mechan@@ isms . you pick up to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey has reached his degree of the spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand , they see the monkeys on the left .
it can deliver about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance in viol@@ ation of inj@@ ury .
it is not so accurate , and not as fast .
now see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the fri@@ ction plant@@ ation .
I can tell you , this was also very exciting results .
since that time , we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later .
in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , we can use Park@@ inson &apos;s other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models .
but our dream is still , they still im@@ plant@@ able to humans .
I really hope that I may show you soon as the human brain gives the means to he@@ al yourself .
thanks a lot .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani , This is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several do@@ zen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can &apos;t need . &quot;
I definitely , .
of course , the question of what are the greatest obst@@ acles , before clinical trials can begin people .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obst@@ acles are the authorities . starting from these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : it &apos;s under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate , etc .
J@@ B : Yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and almost professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to the start of clinical studies . if you see further into the future , as many years it takes place until someone may come into hospital , and this therapy is being available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to start the authority to start soon ?
then it must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it is already a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evalu@@ ate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ center study .
you must first really re@@ prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit to TED and that you have told us .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we make a great mistake to consider it as a course of course .
we do not see the democracy as the broken plant which is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we t@@ end to consider it as un@@ changeable haz@@ ard@@ ess .
we believe that cap@@ alism are forced to democracy on democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w made from Singapore and his big desc@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing , it is possible that it is possible to have a flo@@ wering capit@@ alism and impressive growth while the politics are completely und@@ em@@ ocratic .
in fact , Dem@@ ocracy enjoyed the democracy in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece , the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ im@@ able to det@@ ect me as the Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- do not affect the savings of our country , which have been implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought there is no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w or the Communist Party of China could be repeated , or some of my un@@ belie@@ vable friends that would be repeated , when they would change democracy .
at this point , I would like to present an economic model for a real democracy .
I be@@ have to believe jo@@ int@@ ly with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ Group would help us to save democracy , but we could need to save democracy , but that we may need a true and def@@ ective democracy .
because without democracy , our soci@@ eties are growing , our future ow@@ est and our great , new technologies shall apply .
on the topic , I would like to give you an interesting cont@@ radi@@ ction where our t@@ aver@@ n is threatened .
I know the &quot; twin summit &quot; par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; .
a summit is known to you . you know and know him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , which takes its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but just a few recognize his tw@@ illing .
a mountain of un@@ used cash which is to be able to invest there , but it could be able to invest there where it would be productive and income , with whom they could produce the Schul@@ den@@ berg , and even all the things could be ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I know them two numbers .
over the past 3 months were invested in the US , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial facilities , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment , and so on .
it sounds 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars according to a lot of money , up to it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were in the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , except for the stock exchange and real estate prices .
thus form debt and un@@ productive capital , the twin summit which are not equal to the common market mechan@@ isms .
the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , and therefore an low demand that could not be invest@@ ing in which they could not be invest@@ ing , that his son would kill him if he will grow up ,
in@@ rolled up the circumstances which lead to that Ö@@ di@@ pus had k@@ ills him .
this is my ha@@ em@@ y with the capit@@ alism --
in particular , all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our life to enh@@ ancing human tal@@ ents , develop and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are cru@@ cial for salvation of the earth .
is it democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we proceed : what do we understand ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the corporate form , control the outdoor and the poor as a majority to the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ical Dem@@ ocracy , of course , of course , too many
women , fore@@ ign@@ ers , and of course sl@@ aves .
however , it would be an error , the job value of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy because of these outputs .
the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy , and is that they did not only agree to the law of free differences , but important and cru@@ cial , that they were entitled to them the right to political action with the same voting rights in questions of the state .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Dem@@ ocracy did not have long been held --
like a candle , which light@@ eth very light , it is also sc@@ anned quickly .
however , our own liberal dem@@ ocrac@@ ies have not have their roots in the antique Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the smooth revolution of 1688 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens , our liberal democracy is based on the assets of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ulti@@ mat@@ ely was a stat@@ ute for reign@@ ing .
for the liberal democracy first came up when a complete separation of politics and economy are possible and the democratic process began to be ass@@ orted , while the economy was the world of concerts -- a dem@@ ocrac@@ ies .
in our today dem@@ ocrac@@ ies , since that time , during which the separation of politics and economy began to under@@ take a serious struggle between the two taking the economy and trans@@ g@@ inal policy .
w@@ ore you , why the polit@@ icians cannot find out more like this ?
it is not an Deg@@ en@@ eration of their DNA .
it is in mind that it can be in the government and still not in power because the power is turned away from politics into the economy and they are separated .
I mention my ha@@ em@@ akers with the capit@@ alism .
if you think about it , it is in about as a herd of cra@@ b , which is so sustainable the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that it is necessary to be hun@@ gry .
similarly , it is similar to the economic crisis that it grows through the self @-@ created economic crisis himself . the power of concerts grows , political goods falls , the in@@ equality and the director of concerts are to be conf@@ id@@ ated to invest the cash of their businesses .
the successful capit@@ alism on &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher will increase the twin summit , and the greater dis@@ appearance of human labor force and the wealth of mankind .
if this is true , it is ob@@ vious that we have to return the policy and the economy , it would be better when the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; took control of control , as in an ancient Athens , apart from the excl@@ usion of sl@@ aves , women and fore@@ ign@@ ers .
by the way , this is no new idea .
the mar@@ x@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not be different .
the doctrine from Deb@@ ak@@ el the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only has a mir@@ acle such as in the ancient Athens , without creating a new species of the breeding and con@@ spir@@ acy .
but there is a solution : create the working poor !
capit@@ alism do it , by combin@@ ing low @-@ glo@@ om@@ ed employed by automation and rob@@ ots .
the problem is , as long business and politics separate areas , the automation makes the twin summit will be higher , con@@ spir@@ acy , and social conflic@@ ts de@@ eper as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries like China .
so , we need to re@@ design the economy and policy again , and make sure that we dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ fy the re@@ un@@ ified range , otherwise we end the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; how a documentation can be published .
the question is not that the capit@@ alism known the technical achievements , which he has caused , sur@@ vive , --
the interesting question is whether the capit@@ alism is similar to &quot; Matrix , &quot; is res@@ em@@ bles or by something that the society in &quot; Star Trek &quot; is res@@ em@@ bles in the machinery of human beings &quot; or into a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like it could look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; @-@ like U@@ top@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you all examples in all , some examples .
in the field of business : please make money earned a capital market before you are working and in your capital you will follow up from a company to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one has just works -- is the property of those who work in the company .
then all income from capital and income from revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no differenti@@ ation of more between those who belong to the company but does not work in it , and employees that work there , but the company does not belong . no do@@ ve more between capital and jobs , no major g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ars , and ulti@@ mat@@ ely no increasing twin summit .
in the area of global political economics : please note that our national currencies would have a freely flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Mon@@ etary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; will be issued in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is in this currency , -- call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and any government pay the sum which corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or a trading income of the country , to a joint fund .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment agents are r@@ ar .
this is no new idea .
it is bas@@ ically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es proposed in the Bret@@ ton Wo@@ ods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to use it .
today we have , in particular , especially in front of a re@@ un@@ ified policy and economy .
the world , which I describe you , is simultaneously liber@@ ated , in which they privileg@@ ed individuals , and mar@@ x@@ istic , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the ru@@ bb@@ ish &apos;s history , c@@ yn@@ es@@ ian , globally ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ ak@@ ening in one such world
or will we fall in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we op@@ ted ourselves together .
it is in our hands , and we are better dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you write yourself in your biography itself as the liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , is Marx relevant .
the reason for re@@ un@@ ification of politics and economy is ... T@@ un we cannot generate a massive decline in the overall economy that Larry Sum@@ mers have known as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
due to the transfer of this crisis of a part of the Earth on the next , as we see it will not only see our dem@@ ocrac@@ ies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is ir@@ relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist Marx@@ ist , and as Ke@@ yn@@ es , and therefore I am entirely we@@ aker .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a Greek , a kind of philos@@ oph@@ ical explanation - Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your presentation , you chose Singapore and China and yesterday at supp@@ er of Red@@ ner did you very clearly what you think from the view of the West to China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big level of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal dem@@ ocrac@@ ies we have the adoption of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limits the democracy on politics in the field where most of the economy plays , -- the area of business -- a completely dem@@ ocrac@@ ies .
in certain respec@@ ts , when I may say that prov@@ oc@@ ative to say that China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
-- do you remember -- we t@@ end to connect to liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is a mistake , histor@@ ically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tical , which affects the democratic development .
what you can now observe in China , is similar to development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now preparing to do that which the west in the 19th century itself did , sm@@ ell enormous to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curi@@ ous to your experiences as the Minister of Hell@@ as of Greece .
Y@@ V : I lik@@ ed that this is .
BG : Yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
to adop@@ t us from self @-@ counter@@ ability to adop@@ t a massive fall @-@ line through the Eurozone , and continue to continue through the development of the European Union mas@@ sively .
we had the opportunity to reve@@ als the Greek ancest@@ ors -- the way , the first proposal was that this den@@ ial ob@@ serv@@ atory --
unfortunately it right to do . unfortunately , m@@ ow@@ es within the Eurozone , within the European Union , continues to den@@ y the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you tried to get an economic system , which is not sur@@ vive , through political will and authority to live on life , but if the conversation occurs , it happens ab@@ ru@@ pt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : which change are you ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future when we change it .
BG : have you made any mistake in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back in harvest ...
if there are a Minister of Finance , or any Minister there , after 6 months of office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , claims that he had no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistake .
the greatest error was to sign the application for an end to the end of February .
I believed that there was an ambitious interest on the ATM system to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they wanted to accommodate only our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to work with the compl@@ aints , they ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t have entered they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Dep@@ ression &quot; .
None of the Tro@@ ika , which puts us this policy , was a : &quot; that was a kol@@ os@@ sal@@ er fault . &quot;
BG : despite all , and in spite of the aggressive valley of talks , you still seem to be quite a @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my critic@@ ism of the European Union and the euro zone comes from som@@ eb@@ ody , who lives and loves .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone was not sur@@ vive .
for if they are not sur@@ vive , the acqu@@ ain@@ ees will be d@@ ump@@ ed and destro@@ ying the European Union .
this is not alone for Europe &apos;s cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we consider ourselves the way of a post@@ hum@@ id 1930 , which it appears to me , it is also subsequently promoted to the future of European as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope so you &apos;re going to be wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price have never heard most of the most likely , even though he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enter@@ tain@@ ing minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy started three years ago .
Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company is Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an icon and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for this shows , shows the shows and the content of the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fighting industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy don &apos;t know any of your choice .
he must find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows , which are on the right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation level of over 2500 TV series on the site IMDB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given this review .
if your show is valu@@ ed at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows as &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that you sw@@ ore a season , where you ask for a season , &quot; Where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left hand , here at this end , shows shows as &quot; Tod@@ dler and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should be enough to tell you what at the end of the turn .
Roy Price puts no longer to ri@@ ad on the left side of the curve , for I think it needs special intelligence to sign &quot; Tod@@ dler and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
it turns out more thoughts about the average harvest , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad@@ ly , they are simply beautiful .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course , it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something , therefore I want to ris@@ ate enough price .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he will hold a competition .
he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses the first epis@@ ode of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first epis@@ ode of each other shows , and shows them online where they can watch for free .
and if the Amazon has turned out things , don &apos;t lay up , right ?
millions of vie@@ wers look forward to these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed at the view of this shows .
they are wat@@ ched by Roy and his team to take it all .
you record when you start the show when to pau@@ lin them pieces , ski@@ pping them again .
they collect million of data to decide to decide what show them ought to produce them .
in fact , they collect the data , these and what is the answer , and this is the answer : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four repub@@ lican US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yeah , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of those show can remember , because they did not think so well .
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the Word -- as the average of this turn 7.4 amounts and Alpha House landing at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not just that worked on Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time in another company , another manager has a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for the program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly as Roy is always on the search to find this a super show and he also uses data , but he makes it slightly different .
instead of a contest to stage , he and his team will participate in the existing information about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give shows the shows , which shows them like etc .
then they ut@@ ili@@ ze these data to find these small details about the spect@@ ators : which shows them which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts , they went into a car , and decided to make a Sit@@ com via four Sen@@ ators , but a dr@@ ama series on a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
Yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ experienced companies .
they connect these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic came some@@ how , that all should work at all .
if you collect million data , for a decision to come , you should make a good decision to make a decision .
it has 200 years on statistics as a Back @-@ up .
it is optim@@ ised by very efficient computer .
that is what you can expect , is good television , or ?
if data analysis does not work , then it is something sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we expect more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
do anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in contact with this software in contact with this software . come in contact with this software , you are in jail .
if anyone ask here in the US in the USA and for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than choose whether a show is good or bad , it is decided if a person is good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , evidence is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . this is not that a company like multi @-@ Health system doesn &apos;t know how to use data .
these data are also false @-@ weigh@@ ted firms .
Yes , even Google does sometimes keep error .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can be align@@ ed by data analysis of influ@@ enza , the worst kind to speak , -- by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a great news sens@@ ation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; magazine .
it worked just fine , year around the year , until it suddenly doesn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sens@@ ation , including the re@@ voc@@ ation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data r@@ ack@@ able companies such as Amazon , and Google ab@@ use sometimes something .
despite all this mistake , data will be reflected in decisions of life , -- in the workplace , at the legal review , in medicine .
so we ought to ensure that data are helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in the comp@@ uter@@ ized gen@@ etics -- a field where some very cle@@ ans@@ ing people un@@ able to make many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . I have known some samples above the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do you have two things :
as the first cut this problem in its details , so that you can analy@@ ze the components ; as a second place the details will put together in order to put an un@@ loading .
sometimes you must do this several times , but there are always two things : to take one another and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help maintain a problem and understand his parts .
they are not appropriate to use the parts again and then to come to a de@@ er .
there is another tool and we own all : our brain .
if there is something that is good , in which the brain is good , pieces and pieces again , even if the information is in@@ complete , especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have data and conf@@ used , where they also belong to the process .
they ut@@ ili@@ ze data to understand their audience better , what they would not have been able to understand , but the decision to put all these parts , re@@ placing and a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which does not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they received a great personal risk of this decision .
reflec@@ ting the Amazon , which is wrong , on the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first in order to w@@ ett@@ le TV ideas , then as they chose the Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they say always : &quot; that tell us the data . &quot;
it didn &apos;t lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think that things are going to run if data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool not to forget this device is quite useful .
thanks to you ...
before it was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; called . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you must shake only the ball , to get a reply . &quot; highly probably &quot; -- exactly here in this moment .
I &apos;ll try it later with a technique demo .
I have met some decisions in my life , and I have to have heard in the after@@ ward onto the ball .
but , as you want to know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by slightly much extinc@@ tion , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the principle .
so that the ball is wis@@ er and kl@@ u@@ ger . ulti@@ mat@@ ely , it &apos;s finally to make decisions at the end of the right turn , if we want to achieve something unusual at the end of the right turn .
and I find this as a very encour@@ aging news that it will still be paid in spite of the great amount of data still to make decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks involved .
because at the end there is not the data that risks , with which you reach the right at the end of the turn .
thank you beautiful .
