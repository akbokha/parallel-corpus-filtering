<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prizes as New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard from Edward Snowden, wrote Risen a book where he published the NSA illegal phones by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter, which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this article, he describes a disastrous US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally bomb for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But don't you know, to whom the chapter is not afraid?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government filed against Risen and calls him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he was used for the symbol of the government, Whistleblower to condemn journalists and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to WWI, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right when media is not able to protect this information and to protect the identity of the Much.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government of Risen, he did something that had many courageous reporter did before him: he refused, and told that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have a year for years, it was indispensable for their case, the demands of the government dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring, the reporter and sources are always lower.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of too bad and crises to say, that can also make his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And thus, the investigators, without understanding, his phone calls departed to his home.</seg>
<seg id="21">Similarly, as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its loan agreements, and even travel expenses with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, that is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke at his attack, Whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary claims more than any US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government had too much too much of her work as geheim.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security, the result was that a Whistleblower went to journalists.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game that will be protected by the first Constitutional laws, because the government has always have more possibilities to add all out.</seg>
<seg id="28">But as the technology of the government allows to dispute the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And though, they can record from the moment to record, rather than in the afterward, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, communication software that it isn't yet called, when Risen had written his book, and it is considerably more safer than normal E-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transfer system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet's most famous Aaron Swartz, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of an e-mail to emend you go on a news site, such as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can download documents or information, like with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the telecommunications agency has received.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, the government cannot be described more information about, and many of the information that would like to request it would be not available.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the dance to protect the Press Freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments over the world always new spionline technologies that are all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's to ensure that not only technology enthusiastic like Edward Snowden have a possibility to protect iniquities. it is also important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about deers by soldiers of complaint and from overfilled hospitals. or the next environmental employees, the alarm to the seated water of Flint proposes. or a pilgrim-Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect your constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the greatest datalogy of the history was published.] [what does it mean?] [what does it mean?] [what does it mean?] [what does it mean?] this week we have been sent by messages via a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's lawyer County Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of this documents forgives a small insight into the secret world of staroases.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will receive an impression of it, how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mosbag Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has stepped.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad roommates in tax-phases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trail of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's president Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of kids, one famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there is a lot of many people and others to wait for the next release, and wait for the next release documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now sounds like the plot of a agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weep away from you, unusual people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we ask what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and Mighty are able to hide their assets in tax oases, and not all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that about us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax oases of some few are used to hide its assets and wear something that we have been discussing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these starters work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always make it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has one company in another firm, in another company what it makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">To presumably, because there was no more prominent Americans that came into this disclosure of the scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no real American citizens to hide its fortune in starfish.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these starters work, Mosbag has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We would have a privacy of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to see connections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Indeed, it is so that one needs more information in some US states must have less information, to establish a company as a library of a library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the United States has allowed to rebate school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It also has been permitted to rebate especially challenged trailers.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behaviour that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness, we'll need to figure out how to see all this in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a discovered investigators into the offices of 13 incurative firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as African ministers, who wanted to bring the suspects money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all by up to our investigator suggestions, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all regulations. None of these lawyers took us as cliffs, and of course it was handed over to us. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It's also important to consider it not as a single falls.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not go to have one individual lawyer, underlined our discoveries suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It does not go to a single top politic, managed in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works to be established through the corruption, tax accusation, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to handle this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this type of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very soft sinners, as if we could do nothing; as if nothing could have changed, as if there is always the rich and Mighty beings.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as an interpreter, I see that it began to change itself.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen precaulicences to more transparency what the owners of companies relates.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has recorded in central registers at national level, who really is behind firms in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the U.S. is left.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliaments, but this does not make the progress, we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would like to see how this Panama disclosure, this gigantic insight into the world of tax oases, used as a means to help in the US and globally for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need common people who are mothers when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headstore.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy that are up and say: "Intransparent is not good for the business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it to end the laws of the intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">In addition, we can finally put the intransparency that still enables these kind of tax accursed, corruption and money.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story how I was almost kidnapped and in the boot of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had finished my design studies, I made a backyard of birth.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stand and looked for my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and went straight a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to peace-scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I lud him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made it to ask him: "where do you sleep today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just knew him only! he says, he would not know for peace skillets, but I don't know whether he is really plans. I don't kidnapped in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small car boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me: "I have a mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "say," How please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I fixed to the blanket and thought: "Oh dear, what was I dried up?</seg>
<seg id="114">A game of hits in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got an such fear that I went out of the bed, on a tenth points to the door, and my bedroom door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The art works that he had bought from me, is hanged today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has been my eye angle completely changed.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold to me as a stranger than a stranger, actually friends who were only waiting for us to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People at my Air Mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the Air Mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a leap years, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pledge, my co-inhabitants is attracts and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I told that there were a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can be able to transform anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow citizens Brian Chesky: "Brian, I've got something to earn something about it. our apartment will be able to have a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded the Air Mattress and Breakfast "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the Air Mattress of wood.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese ham Omeletts is completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, starsten Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came to roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommates, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure whether you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">We presented the investors: "we wish to create a web site, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are closed when visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Then, on the Internet, they can invite it to some of them to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket was rocket.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not do.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is yet very close at Trost would invest in a business, the stranger allowed in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children have learned that stranger are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, it concerns of things that can be good. we could be able.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the art academy we learned that design is much more than just a look and Haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to create objects from designing objects, but now we wanted to create cutting through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design therefore afford something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a KOSTPROBE, which degree trust we.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it is extracted out of your complexion.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to make you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight from panic which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when it open the first time the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is still personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your text, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So, most guests, if they have a different stay.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just once, who has now actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell Twitter announced that he is the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced, what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What would, if we have changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor revealed only once with his name; if he would have been told, where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, they have 150 addresses, who say all say, "He can really locklocked all phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you need to leave your phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-known feedback system strengthens trust in a well-known feedback system.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people who add negative impacts.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately decided to wait for both the hosts as well as guest performances, before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted with Stanford a study. we examined how it is likely that people trust in each other, as much as they are regarding the age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, most of us are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the more do we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social predominance.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting, when you add the call of one person -- in our case by arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three names, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But it has more than ten, changed everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the correct design can help us to overcoming some of our deep attempts to overcome.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover we drove that trust is dependent on how much man is cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">For example, if you're talking about how, "hi!" you gets no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tells you too much as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is also an optimal grade to openness, such as "Tolle art works in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design, to make this degree on openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of texture to recommend the correct amount text. we also give tips to which themes you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the correct design can help to overcome our advantages from strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">So that we had not counted, the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay these preceding parts.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people are eligible to take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Erstens: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Secondly: the innocent work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is just very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times, if not it runs fine.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unallowed parties or flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Host hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood in front of the front, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing wronges as these calls. it is already a woe when I think just remember it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which one hear in the voice of the anus, and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, out of the 123 million people, only a fraction had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Cause people trusted to one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, can be done miracles.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests enjoyed holiday in Uruguay, where he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, due to sitting on heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protection levels that save one life, even though they don't know any properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">They sail to the hospital when you dies, and wait until you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel themselves, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer stay, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, do not running every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind pure money transitions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I was about this term, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of the section with money transactions be together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here around a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it's just to name "Rental industry," the cause is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you're rewarded to compare it is efficient and reliable, but it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be a rich buffet from local income?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be if in any place to visit a group there, a group there was a thoroughly disappearance and one at a Kneipenwolf neighborhood, which one has never heard.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you get cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would, if we would like to create apartments from the reason?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would it look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would you have to accept the thoughts from mutual?</seg>
<seg id="238">I would like to give me cities, who permit us and relationships, instead of loneliness and deformation.</seg>
<seg id="239">The project already started in South Korea in Seoul, with lots of car parks, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Now they were offered to residents, students that were looking for a lead.</seg>
<seg id="241">Men were killed in people whose children have gone out. there were incubated programs have started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to reach new start-ups in the Share Economy, 785 000 people are charged in 191 countries with a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how it has been taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We won't reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also already before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did we just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the correct design that you can find the correct design.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome the frozen preceding parts.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find the flower,</seg>
<seg id="251">Overwhelmingly overwhelmingly.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, if a red Mazda starts to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We don't know that design can't solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But when it could help us when it had this great influence, I ask myself what we will soon be able for design.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A creditor? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain underwear, a terror attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the security box at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are regarded as I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans know that most would not have Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who never have to know a Muslims: it is great, you know-making.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I'm a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am turned away,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practising, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have decided.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to bear Hijab, my Headpiece.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were kidneys: "why did you feel yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The rusty was: at that time, it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, namely, opposite the print, I felt like 17-year-old, me a perfect and unable beauty inspiration.</seg>
<seg id="279">I haven't just missed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have got with the corruption.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, marked in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relation to God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion, which deepens with every reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes up to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I'm sorry for myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel the feeling that somebody you perceive it, and anyhow do you love it?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I started and started when all of the good Egyptians, my career as engineers.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember, exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had at the end he had served at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "Express".</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people suffering from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">A accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock transformed quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard: "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam "...,"... in the name of Islam... "..."... Jihad Mekka! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country has been attacked, but in the Nay rebuked me the acts of others from a civil war in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new town and begin with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember that -- as we arrived - so deep it went into my seat place, and I was feared to be the first time as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to this night in our apartment, in a new town, in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said, "Be awakening," "Be careful," "Be careful in well lit." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed all the week.</seg>
<seg id="307">It was then open on Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to a prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again, the warnings: "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive range of coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were confectionable unfiltered and I heard also of attacks on Muslims, who held at the free errillas and stroke the Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really surf breaks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt really felt.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this land, had attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have chosen the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was too angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to describe themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can listen to people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When are we going to go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to close Muslims and Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my congregation, like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a gutarticult tumor. just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and Teacher, First Light and Olympionics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There is perhaps a few parking lots, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque leads to consider people of other faith tolerant, and larger civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in the Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not in Mosques radiates.</seg>
<seg id="334">You will be radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radical process, it has found that he is online. as the first, the person receives a brain processes even by their family, that the person believes, the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhassed their behaviour and their ideology.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent Radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group formed like the IS their brood with the correlation.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, as a mother, when human being, I believe that we must do all to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add us to their ordination world when you recognized them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when one look at them, it does not drives them what they are in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brood-ality, which they can read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she promised to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they have been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy to whom she spoke, she brought them to silence, and told her, that their wrath was for unrighteousness in the world, they only would be trouble in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">From nothing is inspired and something that would have been given to their blood, she was a main goal for the instrumentalisation of extremists who pursued a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam turned the connection to God and their congregation.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than to accuse her blood, he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept them before the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it impact on each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of anxiety every day on our democracy, on our thought of thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscienticular studies -- if we fear us, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept a autonomous government system, conformity and advantages.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you were reported to test reviews, in which there were negative over Muslims, they agreed to have more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic issue.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look, when the atmosphere Agathe against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the front of the war in Iraq and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It actually can be a tool for manipulation to the public to identify the foundation of a free society that sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxiconic air of fear sent us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, it does not only need to declare themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was in the dental faculty, talented, very promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweet, generous man to knew her.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he showed her living. she was blossom and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is from my brother such a experienced young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after visiting Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was assassinated in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment as with a execution of Muslims left on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the start.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or we stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We practiced it and for us, there was no slight decision because we would like that America would like to check our children: one that would be able to check us through fear, or, in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose us for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we left silent, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes came out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, he left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, the imam an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because the half of the gathered together were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believer and non-believers who had come to attack us but to teach us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have been collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and encourage panic and lectures.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you dial in the moment of fear and Fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to number secure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will they close to those who are my: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have a Nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you might remember a TEDTalk, a memorial with draught, in a noble monuments, thus one exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not say. I am entirely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I'm so unusual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you can look at the Muslims all over the world, and I did all the world's largest performed study on all over the world, people want to know people normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want me well-known for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no respect for any one.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear to appear, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What a platform for DIY began, is about to become a milliardeners.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drugs. possible, it is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcel delivery in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aviation machines in France has built a six metre high tower in front of 1 500 puller. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">A high speed and acceleration in the smallest space is connected by connecting rooms.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build an independent structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear trucks, to tackle with turbulences and generally responded to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the boundaries of the possibility of autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to works a system of autonomous, it must be collective bareid where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic loading.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in room, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available at the highest ebe. e.g. "start" and "landen."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight unit that tries to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starfish, it is efficient, a much more efficient than helicopter in all her variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most Starrvolfibers it can be floating, and has a great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a miter site.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear bumps is that they react more sensitive to turbulences such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea is behind that the flight unit doesn't matter the optimal position, and the performance can be improved through practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we are often preparing a fundamental abstract issues related to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about machines with thousands of moving parts that merged themselves to breach you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, the pilots were fully remote controlled flight machines, which had only two floating parts: a propeller, and a tail boom.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flies can only work with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest flight machine. it was recently invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clap, hinges and diagonal surface, no further actuators or controls, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, in the inner living there is much, so that it can be stable, and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nonetheless, it does not have an elegant Algorithm of the stern starters. to bring it to flies, I have to throw it perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood, it's right to throw, if all look to me is low, therefore, what I shot you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospinner is an exercise in genius, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that he is not balanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way, he will receive the great ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">In space for all directions, no matter what is turned in direction, or even as he is rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">The remainder can be ordered in models, the rest will be learned directly at feeding.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines will be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin-propeller aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a engine or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery - can continue to fly the machine if even restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will be able to demonstrate that we will make a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was synthetics to be synthetic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The great number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a pallet of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and fit them with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit is white, where the room is and is self-controlled. so there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Broadway a fly lamp would like to practice a fly lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it's difficult to anticipate the influence of these technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the salary in the development and the rhage.</seg>
<seg id="466">It is as a reminder, as wonderful and enchanting our universe, and that it is creative, they are able to recover them in such a spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has been solves massively and economic potential, is the bag on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="469">Nearly 1.3 billion years ago, in a very wide distant galaxy two black holes always faster, they walk to the mass of three sun in a tenth of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">These short moment they shining bright as all stars together in all galaxies, across the whole of us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">Their energy they didn't replace them in the form of light, --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time and the universe exploded in Gravitationswellen.</seg>
<seg id="475">We first found the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Nearly 1.3 billion years ago, just a wide range of life was created on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has brought forth: corals, fish, plants, Saul, people, and -- God arise, even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">In front of approximately 25 years ago, a group especially Mues-- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- a huge laser detector, to search for gravitationals, which arise around by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people acknowledged them as a mad gene, so the U.S. National Science Foundation contributed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">Following the decades of development, design, conception and extremely much harder work they built the detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometer gravitationswan observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, precision of LIGO could significantly increase what the detection rate improved considerably.</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why the Advanced LIGO is called.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, difficult problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitationals of the two collitifier black holes caused by the earth through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In the basically the fruits of my life were.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I worked, is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretic physicist at MIT. he has been investigated for 23 years of gravitationals from black holes and their observatories such as LIGO measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitationswelle is a cabling of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">In front of the wave, the space and its entire content will be stretched to a direction and in the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers perform a correct albering dance during the relatives of courses in courses.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitation sware extremely weak, even more ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched by the waves and stretched. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1. thus man explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured less than a thousandths of the radius of an atomic core. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text by Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, as follows: "the technical difficulties of the building of such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventor, and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO has been an ear than a eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wave length, which is much smaller than the things around us: face tags, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. for example, you can make a picture or a card of Dingen, by using several points for the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">At sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very hard, actually impossible to make a picture of dingen, which means you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">For the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we are sitting from specific properties like pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the history.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now talking to Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"Dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to Gravitationswellen.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't have any simple images of objects in the All.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by changing to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies are in the hearing range for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern into sound, we can listen to all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation in laugh, we can advise us about the collision of two black holes that my colleague Scott already worked very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circular round: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two body very quickly, you hear the same circus with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: WU-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement of movement, dominates into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget to hear this as a noise from -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which are about as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: if we consider, what does that mean.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the divinest body in all, one with a mass of 29 sands, the other with a mass of 36 sun, surrounded by a hundred times a second, before they were colliged.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine that forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it, because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet a completely new way to explore the universe as she never had previously been possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">We can listen to all listen and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can see -- practically or generally -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why do people explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical process will be done in the core, which lies behind thousands kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon in the core.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see it, because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitationswan penetrating iron, when it would be transparent glass. the urknall: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe. but we will never see it because of the world will be covered by his own nightlights.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using Gravitationswellen, it should be possible to turn back until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably the most important thing: I'm optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see, and from which we have no idea. things we can only discover that we are listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found equal to the first race things we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague on MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars, the black holes caused by the black holes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so called the Saurierknochen to our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us a completely different angle of view to the events in all, to the emergence of the stars, and ultimately, as we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now there, so encourage to be possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and noise of the cosmos of Kosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a brand new generation of Observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nice when the urknous itself too loud?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great Dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream up with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year would I say "Yes!" say before I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">It doesn't matter whether it was nervous, me in unpleasant situations, I have to say "Yes".</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">What do I wanted to play with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared me, eliminated my fears.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fears, rehearken to keep my social fear -- Puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of an word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"Yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"Yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life to an unexpectedly article. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls from unexplained reasons all "estimation,"</seg>
<seg id="570">It would be a waiter from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need milk for my snap."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her, when I was just on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">One new way of life in my family. from there I swore to me to play with them once you don't play with them. no matter what I'm doing, or whither I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Fast. I'm not perfect, but I'm trying to try me.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a blinded side effects: only recently, I really got the "Yes" -sagen to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am authored. I think of things, awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I have been doing television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I have responsible for that 70 hours of programme can go out into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that previously existed.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days for four shows, thus all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programs, which simultaneously are four, 16 episodes simultaneously: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series are running on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">In the whole world, my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shipments which I created myself, and not only produced, so still no ill, creative, creative time to gather my fans of bonfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell it, because I know what you think if the word "author is" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you that work so hard, whether you take a company, a country or a budget, so that I am not only at the computer, that you may say that I am not only at the computer, that it is true when I say: I understand that there is not a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all the work, everything that has blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I have been working much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened to work in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is still a country dating from the Nichts.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set up troops in a painting, looking on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dreaming, one tall, fly a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically and advising, funny and disrupting, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible, and the best in it is the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the totals sounds like a busy road, I could go forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take on, if I tell them the Summen that I have explained in writing that the letter is prepared to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me that doing it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Summen -- when I started with the television production when I began to work and reconstruct, I discovered this cause, this Summen, this energy. the Summen!</seg>
<seg id="618">The Summen is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The Summen is action and activity. the Summen is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the totals is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The totals is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't move differently than in size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not unlike any size, no matter how the price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is Genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know just that I'm not at the failure, and I know just that I love the smen.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will tell you only, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear question: the more successful I, ever capabilities, more about more episodes, the more work there, the more work at the same time, the more time I write me, the more I write me history so much more expectations exist.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to work successfully, the more you have to work me.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what I said about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the Summen, the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I'm the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only that Summen?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overstressed, exaggerated, exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters to the truth pampered that her mom is a single-one-one-Institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimation, I want to go to Shonda."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanic.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals were ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The totals of the engine was driven.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was made.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums was not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My smen was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-days, working weekends, no reue, nothing delegate, isn't enough, with a whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no summen.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview of Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the Summen and the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what makes you doing what you do, do the work that man love, suddenly do anything?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "hay you out of the author of Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know how to be doing, man loves to be a teacher, someone loves to be a teacher, a painter, Bill gates, and knows how to say the summing even if you knew the sums when the totals stops, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still an Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South America winery" is a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way to outside, late and she says: "mama, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will already say no more, than I will be aware of my things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and second, she named me not "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "estimations."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is it happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I passe it, if I am Titan bin and my totals concrete, and it change all of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mum, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come down, we laughing a lot and I read more dramatically from the book "Body Poops" in front of them.</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in lack of swim, can I do nothing but to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they exist no more.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that there are sticky fingers and damaging, tender voices, wax crayons and the song, in which it comes to cheer, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" is losing.</seg>
<seg id="688">All is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so close that I hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something that is dissolved in me.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes to and an energy feed comes down.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Summen comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is silent, but it is ready.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel at me when I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's remain with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The totals that labour falls, the Titanensummen, that's only the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who, if I am going to help you, if I am resolved using shipments and TV hours and how working my brain, then I forget that the real Summen is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totals is no strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real Summen is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The swmen is the current to come from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real Summen is self-consciousness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real Summen are ignored the pressure of history, which are expelled, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps talk to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, a lot more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child will play with me, I will tell Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I'm doing this for a fixed rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in play, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">They don't play any other way as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth dow,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always have been working, for I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer the workplace as daheim.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a man is better than to be home to house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">I'm ehrily, I know Me "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed, is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We were around in the garden, before and back, and her.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance-parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We cut soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel the greater part of stiffness, so confident and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always read on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the universe of universe is fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I wonder: why did we have ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! say then Yes, if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naiv, for a dream designer.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">They have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find less interesting when you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me, until they need to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but only 15 minutes away.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or Keks were replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teens daughter of all 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece, even at a bad guy!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, any loss.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinners, the children have been done.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drin!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-feeling, my world. it must not be the children. it is to feel the swmen to feel a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It does not go to games with their own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Take the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm looking and I wins. friends meet, books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" stand just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I wanted to make a titanium in the training when I wanted to surpass me more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not full 15 minutes cheers?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums come back in my leisure time. the totals seems to be back when I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, and I find me again in my office. I hear a unknown tune, it meets me and my soul. she pointing me to new ideas. I use it into full breeding and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the Summen, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the Summen, the Summen's not... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now this is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The totals of work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so thanks.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me, that I am a Titan bin. I never seen a Titan, who plays back to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happy are I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">Ever I play, the more feelings I feel good.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better work I.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the Summen. the country that I create, the marathon, whom I run, the troops, the high sound, the sums that totals, the other, the correct smen: the Summen of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I think this smen, the more makes this unusual bleeding, naked and new life feeling in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I think, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am authored. I think of things I awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is a job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from one second on the other side, after a serious stroke, or after an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery is it very frustrating that the brain is in contrast to other body organs, a very small ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious breach of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, tried to improve nervous functions using different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely, they have heard from one of the most popular ones, the "underground irnstimulation." so implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons that improves neurological function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It's really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's milk, which suffered severe pain and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuro-modulation doesn't mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the recovery of brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approaches us this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help, the brain can help yourself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was the chief physician and worked in the notary mark.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often dismissed patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that the brain trauma-traumata shaking the brain and the skull-pressure increase.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the skinnate pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you need to remove a moderniated brain mass at times.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist who analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted cells rise from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">The cells of a riflaxed cells can be comparable to a small children that will be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">It is necessary to find the proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments.</seg>
<seg id="823">Just that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François made it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It just looked like a stem cell culture. by big green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells are surrounded by small and unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still know from the Biology to practice that tribe cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves in any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks, they still died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cellpopulation that looked like stem cells, but it was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We need long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They are from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large-brain nrw.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play an important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they take care of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why will they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participated in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentration camps near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potentially cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">That had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brain mass in the non-language section and then the cells exactly so cultivate as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then they are colored markedly to watch them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them to the deposition of the same individuals.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implantable these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplantable the same cells in contact brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we couldn't work with keys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they had been taken after some weeks, they go back home. the room is already owned, they are not used there, so vanish them.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we met an injury and implanted exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they grew up neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof which they show, are these small points. these are the cells that we are in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop of course.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also to recover from a brain tissue injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we exercise Monkeys with a manual winding assignment.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feather pellets of a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable level of skill level, we achieved a motorized ftex in motorsporty area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thus, the monkeys were paralysed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen if people would happen, they rebuked spontaneously up to a certain degree, exactly as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then try to get with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. you pick up to a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey has reached his degree of the spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand, they see the monkeys on the left.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can deliver about 40% to 50% of its original performance in violation of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate, and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the friction plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, this was also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">In other neuropathological models, we can use Parkinson's other neuropathological models.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still, they still implantable to humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I may show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani, This is wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can't need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely,.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what are the greatest obstacles, before clinical trials can begin people.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: Yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to the start of clinical studies. if you see further into the future, as many years it takes place until someone may come into hospital, and this therapy is being available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then it must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It is already a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multi-center study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really reprove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit to TED and that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We make a great mistake to consider it as a course of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see the democracy as the broken plant which is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchangeable hazardess.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capalism are forced to democracy on democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew made from Singapore and his big descahmer in Beijing, it is possible that it is possible to have a flowering capitalism and impressive growth while the politics are completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, Democracy enjoyed the democracy in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece, the newly elected Greek government -- was unimable to detect me as the Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- do not affect the savings of our country, which have been implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought there is no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China could be repeated, or some of my unbelievable friends that would be repeated, when they would change democracy.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I behave to believe jointly with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the EuroGroup would help us to save democracy, but we could need to save democracy, but that we may need a true and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy, our societies are growing, our future owest and our great, new technologies shall apply.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic, I would like to give you an interesting contradiction where our tavern is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">I know the "twin summit" paradox ".</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and know him as the Schuldenberg, which takes its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But just a few recognize his twilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash which is to be able to invest there, but it could be able to invest there where it would be productive and income, with whom they could produce the Schuldenberg, and even all the things could be urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I know them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months were invested in the US, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial facilities, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">It sounds 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars according to a lot of money, up to it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were in the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, except for the stock exchange and real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus form debt and unproductive capital, the twin summit which are not equal to the common market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe, and therefore an low demand that could not be investing in which they could not be investing, that his son would kill him if he will grow up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Inrolled up the circumstances which lead to that Ödipus had kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haemy with the capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">In particular, all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our life to enhancing human talents, develop and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is it democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we proceed: what do we understand?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, control the outdoor and the poor as a majority to the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenical Democracy, of course, of course, too many</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error, the job value of the athenical democracy because of these outputs.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athenical democracy, and is that they did not only agree to the law of free differences, but important and crucial, that they were entitled to them the right to political action with the same voting rights in questions of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian Democracy did not have long been held --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which lighteth very light, it is also scanned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our own liberal democracies have not have their roots in the antique Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the smooth revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens, our liberal democracy is based on the assets of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for reigning.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy first came up when a complete separation of politics and economy are possible and the democratic process began to be assorted, while the economy was the world of concerts -- a democracies.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our today democracies, since that time, during which the separation of politics and economy began to undertake a serious struggle between the two taking the economy and transginal policy.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wore you, why the politicians cannot find out more like this?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not an Degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is in mind that it can be in the government and still not in power because the power is turned away from politics into the economy and they are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mention my haemakers with the capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about as a herd of crab, which is so sustainable the animals, of which they nourished, decimated that it is necessary to be hungry.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economic crisis that it grows through the self-created economic crisis himself. the power of concerts grows, political goods falls, the inequality and the director of concerts are to be confidated to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The successful capitalism on "Demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher will increase the twin summit, and the greater disappearance of human labor force and the wealth of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to return the policy and the economy, it would be better when the "demos" took control of control, as in an ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not be different.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from Debakel the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only has a miracle such as in the ancient Athens, without creating a new species of the breeding and conspiracy.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism do it, by combining low-gloomed employed by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long business and politics separate areas, the automation makes the twin summit will be higher, conspiracy, and social conflicts deeper as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So, we need to redesign the economy and policy again, and make sure that we democratify the reunified range, otherwise we end the movie "Matrix" how a documentation can be published.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not that the capitalism known the technical achievements, which he has caused, survive, --</seg>
<seg id="958">The interesting question is whether the capitalism is similar to "Matrix," is resembles or by something that the society in "Star Trek" is resembles in the machinery of human beings "or into a high-tech version of ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like it could look like this "Star Trek "-like Utopia instead of the" Matrix "similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you all examples in all, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of business: please make money earned a capital market before you are working and in your capital you will follow up from a company to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one has just works -- is the property of those who work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and income from revenue, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation of more between those who belong to the company but does not work in it, and employees that work there, but the company does not belong. no dove more between capital and jobs, no major gaps between investment and spars, and ultimately no increasing twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economics: please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging markets] will be issued in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is in this currency, -- call them "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" '-- and any government pay the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or a trading income of the country, to a joint fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment agents are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to use it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have, in particular, especially in front of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I describe you, is simultaneously liberated, in which they privileged individuals, and marxistic, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the rubbish's history, cynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awakening in one such world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fall in a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we opted ourselves together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we are better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography itself as the liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, is Marx relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Tun we cannot generate a massive decline in the overall economy that Larry Summers have known as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Due to the transfer of this crisis of a part of the Earth on the next, as we see it will not only see our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is irrelevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am entirely weaker.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't know, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation - YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your presentation, you chose Singapore and China and yesterday at supper of Redner did you very clearly what you think from the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big level of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the adoption of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limits the democracy on politics in the field where most of the economy plays, -- the area of business -- a completely democracies.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain respects, when I may say that provocative to say that China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">-- do you remember -- we tend to connect to liberalism to democracy -- this is a mistake, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical, which affects the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can now observe in China, is similar to development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now preparing to do that which the west in the 19th century itself did, smell enormous to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious to your experiences as the Minister of Hellas of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I liked that this is.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: Yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">To adopt us from self-counterability to adopt a massive fall-line through the Eurozone, and continue to continue through the development of the European Union massively.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to reveals the Greek ancestors -- the way, the first proposal was that this denial observatory --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately it right to do. unfortunately, mowes within the Eurozone, within the European Union, continues to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you tried to get an economic system, which is not survive, through political will and authority to live on life, but if the conversation occurs, it happens abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which change are you ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future when we change it.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistake in your time as a financial minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back in harvest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there are a Minister of Finance, or any Minister there, after 6 months of office, especially in a so-called situation, claims that he had no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest error was to sign the application for an end to the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an ambitious interest on the ATM system to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They wanted to accommodate only our government, just because they didn't want to work with the complaints, they ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't have entered they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the "Great Depression".</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika, which puts us this policy, was a: "that was a kolossaler fault."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all, and in spite of the aggressive valley of talks, you still seem to be quite a-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the euro zone comes from somebody, who lives and loves.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone was not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they are not survive, the acquainees will be dumped and destroying the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This is not alone for Europe's catastrophic consequences, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we consider ourselves the way of a posthumid 1930, which it appears to me, it is also subsequently promoted to the future of European as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope so you're going to be wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price have never heard most of the most likely, even though he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy started three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company is Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has an icon and describes herself on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for this shows, shows the shows and the content of the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy don't know any of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows, which are on the right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation level of over 2500 TV series on the site IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows as "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones", "The Wire" -- all the shows that you swore a season, where you ask for a season, "Where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left hand, here at this end, shows shows as "Toddler and Tiaras" -- -- that should be enough to tell you what at the end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price puts no longer to riad on the left side of the curve, for I think it needs special intelligence to sign "Toddler and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">It turns out more thoughts about the average harvest, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor badly, they are simply beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course, it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something, therefore I want to risate enough price.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he will hold a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes lots of ideas for TV shows and chooses the first episode of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each other shows, and shows them online where they can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if the Amazon has turned out things, don't lay up, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look forward to these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed at the view of this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team to take it all.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when to paulin them pieces, skipping them again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect million of data to decide to decide what show them ought to produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, these and what is the answer, and this is the answer: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yeah, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of those show can remember, because they did not think so well.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the Word -- as the average of this turn 7.4 amounts and Alpha House landing at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not just that worked on Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time in another company, another manager has a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for the program design of Netflix. exactly as Roy is always on the search to find this a super show and he also uses data, but he makes it slightly different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a contest to stage, he and his team will participate in the existing information about the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give shows the shows, which shows them like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they utilize these data to find these small details about the spectators: which shows them which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts, they went into a car, and decided to make a Sitcom via four Senators, but a drama series on a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data-experienced companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic came somehow, that all should work at all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect million data, for a decision to come, you should make a good decision to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years on statistics as a Back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimised by very efficient computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">That is what you can expect, is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then it is something scary because we live in a time in which we expect more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Do anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in contact with this software in contact with this software. come in contact with this software, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone ask here in the US in the USA and for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than choose whether a show is good or bad, it is decided if a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, evidence is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not that a company like multi-Health system doesn't know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">These data are also false-weighted firms.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does sometimes keep error.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can be aligned by data analysis of influenza, the worst kind to speak, -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature" magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year around the year, until it suddenly doesn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data rackable companies such as Amazon, and Google abuse sometimes something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all this mistake, data will be reflected in decisions of life, -- in the workplace, at the legal review, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we ought to ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- a field where some very cleansing people unable to make many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. I have known some samples above the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do you have two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As the first cut this problem in its details, so that you can analyze the components; as a second place the details will put together in order to put an unloading.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you must do this several times, but there are always two things: to take one another and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help maintain a problem and understand his parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not appropriate to use the parts again and then to come to a deer.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we own all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good, in which the brain is good, pieces and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think it was Netflix so successful because they have data and confused, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They utilize data to understand their audience better, what they would not have been able to understand, but the decision to put all these parts, replacing and a show like "House of Cards" which does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they received a great personal risk of this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Reflecting the Amazon, which is wrong, on the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first in order to wettle TV ideas, then as they chose the Alpha House "as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they say always: "that tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It didn't lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think that things are going to run if data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool not to forget this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thanks to you...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball" called. it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you must shake only the ball, to get a reply. "highly probably" -- exactly here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll try it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life, and I have to have heard in the afterward onto the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you want to know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by slightly much extinction, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the principle.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So that the ball is wiser and kluger. ultimately, it's finally to make decisions at the end of the right turn, if we want to achieve something unusual at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I find this as a very encouraging news that it will still be paid in spite of the great amount of data still to make decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end there is not the data that risks, with which you reach the right at the end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
