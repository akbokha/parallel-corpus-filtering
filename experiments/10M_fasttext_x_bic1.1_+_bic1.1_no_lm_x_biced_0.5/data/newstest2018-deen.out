Munich 1856 : four cards that change your eyes to the city
an ir@@ ren sounds , where there are young people .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where now is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small @-@ ärt@@ ner econom@@ ies the former foundation of farmers .
the oldest official map of the mouth promot@@ es exciting stories too few days .
it is nerv@@ ous if maps are not currently .
the kn@@ ow@@ y of everyone who had to be inspired by rain because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was instead of a green me@@ adow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria , state government , are all others as a current - but just therefore very un@@ lock .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
then , how cities and municip@@ alities in the Munich region of Munich has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering stage , which you don &apos;t know as such as such as such .
in the great overview card for cities and municip@@ alities in detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ position leaves , entered .
according to the Bay@@ er@@ ischer testing switching between 1810 and 1864 , the first version of Bay@@ ern@@ s was created .
your client : Napoleon .
the French Army occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Co@@ alition War with Austria .
in Napoleon a glance about the occupied land and gave a to@@ po@@ graphic photo of Bay@@ ern@@ s in order - of course , for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops inv@@ aded the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 1801 , the idea of today &apos;s neigh@@ bo@@ urs , which gave the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria @-@ map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; and thus making the Bavarian State Treaty .
from the year 1856 , the Postal Address is from the year 1856 and is known as all the other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the example of the state capital of the most impressive .
the city has increased in all directions and has been growing .
an example of this is under@@ ne@@ aling , that is still relatively isolation in the card of 1856 .
Sen@@ dling was founded 21 years after creation of the card , so 1877 , in the Munich district .
today , Lower n is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of under@@ sen@@ dl@@ ings are concentrated in 1856 along the Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ erst@@ raße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria .
where today is the West park , one sees nothing than fields - at the first glance : when the single player appears a small@@ ish map with d@@ utz@@ ing lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ als &quot; which was derived from the land tax .
small plots are still no farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ ger .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , at the scene of the Oktober@@ f@@ ecture , was actually a me@@ adow and no concrete bust in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historic map gives in@@ sight into the history of p@@ sychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ position blatt in the area of the today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen just read the street names &quot; or from the height &quot; on the fans &apos; - but also in large letters &quot; ir@@ ren . &quot;
Yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße un@@ locked up people with fl@@ ames .
there was in 1858 / 59 in the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; on the Au@@ er fans . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gud@@ run led the device - that p@@ sychiat@@ rist , who was born in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progres@@ sively for his time , and for example , the chain of the so @-@ called ir@@ ren .
in addition , he has taught the staff , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the lawyer .
for 280 patients first was first place , later on 500 places were expanded .
sometimes this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of the largest p@@ sychiat@@ ric of Germany .
on the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , yo@@ ungst@@ ers come to Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , emig@@ rated to a youth home with training .
West is located west of the TS@@ V Munich East , east motor@@ homes from the 1980s .
in 2015 the children &apos;s house was created &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in architectural an@@ j@@ ection to the roots of Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , who was destroyed during the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz &quot; was hon@@ ored as &quot; main square &quot; which was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger Gasse , &quot; in 1856 .
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs by the Allied ris@@ sen in December 1944 many holes in the inner city center .
one big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the medieval times stood at the Mari@@ enhof at that time , on 5 April 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn .
with the ar@@ eg@@ ler , the old Munich @-@ card can be set up with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights : it@@ iner@@ ary for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for funding of color has issued a warning for colored people who travel through the dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating policies and rac@@ ial attacks by the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Ad@@ visory Committee for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , taking into force until 28 August 2017 , demands special attention to exchange and fore@@ most inten@@ tion , since a series of frag@@ m@@ ise , terrace @-@ based incid@@ ents occur in the entire state and here , &quot; says it in the position of the group .
a recent auth@@ oriz@@ ation of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it heavy , dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating authorities , as well as the pro@@ secution of government , dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate the group trying to publish the it@@ iner@@ ary , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have inj@@ ury of civil rights to pass people .
they become com@@ prised because of their skin colours , they will be merg@@ ed or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear compl@@ aints in such frequencies which we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the USA .
the group c@@ ited as rac@@ ial against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory Sand@@ ers , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
in the beginning of the year , Sand@@ ers died in the beginning of the year after he had no petrol , and had taken out by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without having acc@@ use a crime .
the Council shows a recent report by the Office of the general state administration of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it will be more likely to be more likely than the white motor@@ ists in the state 75 percent .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are consci@@ ous and their families , friends and employees are inform about that which could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be ready to bring it to the Cau@@ tion money or to the rel@@ atives that they are travelling through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 h@@ oriz@@ on , according to the latest figures from the hat@@ red crime program of F@@ BI , which covers the state in relation to the number of such inju@@ ries on the 16th rank of the country .
the journey is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law , which would be difficult to do a company for residential or employment dis@@ cri@@ mination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) were issued for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted un@@ migration agencies , committed to en@@ forced people due to immig@@ ration procedures , which is contri@@ but@@ ing to the AC@@ L@@ U to further ra@@ iler profile .
it@@ ess@@ ings will be viewed as a rule from the Ministry of Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in the last time , the intervention should be deployed on certain laws and trends within the USA .
past@@ oral project is elem@@ entary
the F@@ ish@@ bacher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the next year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag amended Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac acquired a picture before the spot .
at the right @-@ time of the Schw@@ end@@ emann family , representatives of the F@@ ish@@ bacher CD@@ U area met together with the Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schw@@ end@@ emann ref@@ uses first in@@ sights into its operation , in which he cultiv@@ ated 55 hectares of me@@ adows and 40 hectares of forest cultiv@@ ated , 40 da@@ c@@ ows and as well as many young and houses in five apartments .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ milk &quot; is the alternative for@@ market@@ able digest@@ ive ways for the milk of his c@@ ows , so Swan .
exclusively to the table of the holidays , exclusively regional .
since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ chairman of F@@ ish@@ bach , he is also important for the &quot; el@@ ement@@ ar project . &quot;
I can &apos;t stand on der@@ art surfaces .
the green area wor@@ ry for much work , many things to be processed with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; we have strug@@ gl@@ ed here with the conditions and with the Top@@ ography , &quot; st@@ ressed Schw@@ end@@ emann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ abor@@ tive operation and managed these without chemical plant protection and fertil@@ izers , even if he lead no bio@@ operations .
for may@@ or Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the local community has known the importance of the past@@ eur@@ ship projects and is happy about the leader funding . &quot;
at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hop@@ ing that the re@@ arm@@ ament of the surfaces could go out a whole while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and thoughts about how they continued to bring their operation , &quot; st@@ ressed the may@@ or .
the farmers are often due to funding in the critic@@ ism
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 .
the dis@@ closure area is about 40 hectares , which are not checked by at least 2023 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half over leader was funded , a quarter carried out the fishing area .
consequently , the farmers ab@@ sent 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of women .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schw@@ end@@ emann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac st@@ ressed : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and far@@ ming . &quot;
and Peter White stood firm : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot;
the State Court of Cardi@@ ology ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the public transport of wheat ger@@ ences .
the re@@ vel@@ ations of the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a spon@@ sor of the L@@ PR .
in addition , the exten@@ u@@ ous area must not be benef@@ ic@@ able ( hang@@ ings above 35 percent ) and must be threatened by sens@@ ation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build up close to 16 km of fence in 2018 .
the open area is about 35 hectares , the cost of the costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is now decre@@ ases to the Statue of Liber@@ ty .
the saf@@ est character of a regime change is , if they begin to att@@ ach the stat@@ ues .
the Americans estimate these equally as any other - therefore the careful crash of Saddam H@@ uss@@ eins were on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Reg@@ imes , knew what he did , when he did a sym@@ bo@@ lic Ax@@ t in a h@@ itz@@ ky stri@@ fe with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N concerning the suggest@@ ions of the President to dra@@ stic restri@@ ction with the Statue of Liber@@ ty .
to stay fair , Miller was not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of Boat owned and Liber@@ ty Im@@ it@@ ators had got him to w@@ yn@@ ote when he had done it .
but he laid the importance of its importance , and in particular the importance that was attributed to the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , his base was added .
as an Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liber@@ ty is a symbol of American freedom , which ligh@@ tens the world .
po@@ em , which you refer to that later , and not part of the original statue of Liber@@ ty . &quot;
Miller is s@@ ach@@ ite properly , but as he form@@ ulated it , does not really say about history .
it is about the contemporary res@@ on@@ ance to the words of Lazarus , the only , in which a state is not just any old immig@@ rants , but the physi@@ ci@@ ans of the poor : &quot; your labor , your poor , let him sigh@@ ed , free to bre@@ athe , and the waste of your rich c@@ ows . &quot;
there was never a time to watch out on our screens better .
Miller is not involved in literary critic@@ ism - he did clearly that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict for the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural development : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus and her friends who decided to place her words after their death in the base - knew quite good that they had completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ it@@ ism by taking them in an ab@@ used classic representation of the femin@@ ine origin of freedom .
Lazarus has changed this significance : in its po@@ em , the female figure no longer re@@ tract . she has received a voice .
and they themselves also have a very other name : mother of excell@@ ence .
the link with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus has changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the bu@@ yer for the coming of Tr@@ ump , arg@@ um@@ ented in 2010 that the liber@@ ty Statue of Liber@@ ty was invited , but rather a early neo @-@ serv@@ ative that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liber@@ ty is going on .
it should carry the tr@@ ack@@ el of freedom of the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to shine the way into the United States . &quot;
pretty unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here too little .
the importance of the statue is quite and a question of the stand@@ est of perc@@ eption .
the great phenom@@ enon indeed of Lazarus was lying in it , as they were seen by the exhau@@ sted , el@@ ding , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terri@@ ble travelling on the deck@@ s of ships .
it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome which they have to hear .
and this is not the perspective that you want to recognize the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever .
her tor@@ ch is not to shine the way , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ites .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ aves Scott@@ ish members of the United Kingdom
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two sh@@ all@@ ots to the UK
the performance of the Track of the People &apos;s Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scott@@ ish cont@@ ing@@ ent in the world championship team will aff@@ ord a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scott@@ ish athl@@ ete was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland is something special &quot; and the Track of the United Kingdom had to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to find it until we &apos;ll need to figure , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I speak with people at the Scott@@ ish Institute of Sport and they think that it has done something to do what they did .
the Scott@@ ish Ath@@ l@@ ete think that it has done something to do what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scott@@ ish athletes are awarded medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - which was to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite mod@@ est .
your chapters was un@@ belie@@ vable , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of Ath@@ l@@ ete , no matter whether they were sc@@ ott@@ ish or practice them , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling that f@@ id@@ h all of course was great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ silver medal winner , which will compete in its fifth World Championships at 400 m Hur@@ dles , says that it is un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably , that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots in the British crew .
in Scotland , Scotland is the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , the 1983 and 2015 .
the distance series Mu@@ ir is leading up on this path and took place in five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m run@@ ners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which runs 1,500 m , is another sh@@ ak@@ ot that one should win the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games , which should observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of its first World Championships , when the only other scar@@ let &apos;s team was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team capit@@ alism says that they are &quot; enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly proud &quot; on the fact that many of their land sle@@ ek not only belong to team , but in some cases also with medals and with the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing of team capit@@ als , lies in it , that it was worth a great honour to know , but to know that my team mate is tuned for me , &quot; makes it something very special for me , &quot; added it .
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we are come .
and they are here as a well @-@ established athl@@ ete , athletes who want to go on po@@ di@@ ums .
what do I think about my speech ?
Yes , I think it worked fine .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , because we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to set up this home support and benefit that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go there and to con@@ tour and it is simply as a great atmosphere there was without . &quot;
sign@@ posted by crit@@ ics on Facebook : don &apos;t throw yourself a public position if you don &apos;t want to reduce the chance of vot@@ ers .
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers will beat him for everything , from the inner policy up to its political principles .
he sh@@ elled at the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not have his crit@@ ics to silence .
in 1783 , Washington said , &quot; The freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , st@@ up@@ id and dum@@ b , as they are led as the sheep for the batt@@ les . &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an , who must work to work more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have block@@ ed the contributions from at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union refused him in the beginning of this week .
the staff of the governor dis@@ missed the compl@@ aint as fri@@ vol , and the online @-@ comment was full of a counter@@ action with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type such as H@@ og@@ an .
this is a repub@@ lican Govern@@ or in an over@@ whel@@ ming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest conc@@ iliation of the nation of 50 govern@@ ors .
HO@@ G@@ AN is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary h@@ unter head .
he has a strong hand during the leadership of his state and strict dis@@ position of principles .
also , it was also sent to use Facebook as pri@@ mer funds to connect to his vot@@ ers and play his hair @-@ less head for chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of people who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is officially designated as officially designated and of employees , which will be paid by public tax points - un@@ necessary and ulti@@ mat@@ ely .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ending the spokes@@ person &apos;s spokes@@ person , Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse attacked the actions of the Govern@@ ors and arg@@ um@@ ented , that the block of comments nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of TRO@@ LL@@ EN or chambers or water @-@ filled people that swe@@ ep online .
the post said with some of the real people , block@@ ed by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leadership , a teacher , a busin@@ ess@@ man and a priest , no comfort .
they all said that their comments are respec@@ t@@ ful , proven and not prof@@ ane .
the priest c@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
law@@ yers Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bow@@ ie , M@@ d . , was not filled , but they asked them to hate them .
&quot; I comm@@ ented that I was dis@@ appointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current messages , &quot; wrote in the commentary &quot; The Post Office . &quot;
&quot; I think this idea too , if a number of people aged on the same subject , then they become more than a so @-@ called collective benefit , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the members of the governor as &quot; focused on @-@ attack &quot; would probably be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to feed a message by using simply a cr@@ itic , or negative comment by using a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you have had the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conduc@@ t@@ ins and inc@@ and@@ ise demonstr@@ ators , and to bring up protest@@ ers and to silence .
but exactly that happens digit@@ ally .
HO@@ G@@ AN is not the first public officials , who critic@@ ises the Facebook and other social media has been imp@@ acted .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users , which were block@@ ed from his Twitter fe@@ eds .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County conf@@ essed the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria when they knew one vot@@ ers from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Govern@@ or Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U on Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers per@@ ched between 1776 and 1800 , and anon@@ ymous letters were struck down on his leadership .
and even Washington had anon@@ ymous tro@@ ll .
the people who used pseud@@ on@@ ym@@ s like &quot; Ju@@ ri@@ cola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
Pet@@ itions , who critic@@ ises its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , according to the historic documents , according to the historical documents that were collected by the George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t have them to silence .
freedom of freedom and dis@@ courses are based on the basis of our nation .
and true leadership , which means to accept .

less lung cancer through pas@@ siv@@ ity
over the past two decades , fewer humans are extinc@@ t to lung cancer .
regarding this result , scientists of the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer patients are attributed to Pas@@ siv@@ ity , &quot; said Senior Ac@@ commod@@ ations .
in comparison , he moved to this subject to this topic in 1994 .

the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections are considered very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are located in the time , &quot; so the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the location is more comp@@ lic@@ ated as susp@@ ected , since the ground amount is much sc@@ anned , what is not in the plans .
the traffic , which always refle@@ cts the construction work , represents a big problem for the b@@ aut@@ ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; Ig@@ al of the drivers in front of red lights and fl@@ ags are already enormous , &quot; reported Hein@@ ze .

an existing movement that touched for independence against the Dutch rule , driven quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta to reve@@ als the control of the regions or legal evidence .
in 2003 , the province was officially split in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea and the eastern part of the island .

Pap@@ ua is Indones@@ ian province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality rate and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia of Indonesia .
the largest and profit@@ able gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an in Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a city province in New Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , a value of 3.1 billion US dollars and copper has been removed .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has an estimated 78 billion US dollars valu@@ ed in the value of an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
but this ri@@ ches are however a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , which is intended to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military .
a study from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local Mil@@ itar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ons and units paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ vian amounts due to larger aut@@ onomy , these golden go@@ ose and are gr@@ am@@ less treated .
according to activ@@ ists , more than 500,000 pap@@ ua were killed and thousands of thousands were tort@@ ured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military .
according to the meeting of Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ es@@ land in Pap@@ u@@ as Region of Law in 1970 .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we value Every@@ thing , &quot; it says in a report by Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane , from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and cru@@ ises are particularly popular - and the brut@@ al pre@@ cip@@ itation of peaceful demonstr@@ ations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims to count as every week is going through , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ resear@@ cher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a refuge of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but dem@@ ographic development is changed , as Muslim economic activity of the pop@@ ulated islands are Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

the Indones@@ ian President J@@ oko Wid@@ odo , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , said during his election campaign in 2014 , the in@@ equality and legal inju@@ ries in Pap@@ ua .
former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 distri@@ cts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua our little change has changed , and today will feel the loc@@ als .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we have approved in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will be restored our h@@ opes that is restored by righteousness , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outdoors and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers were killed on a motorbike through the darkness .
the troubled children said to them that they should switch their flo@@ odlight .
one of the soldiers took to her sound , and came back later with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
soldiers who had dr@@ unk were dr@@ unk , and sm@@ ote the group with their guns , saying victims and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers faced in the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yu@@ li@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to pass that he fell into Kom@@ a .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ves on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered in a football pitch ahead of local police station and the military comm@@ ando Center in order to demand justice .
in the circle , she tru@@ sted and carried the Wa@@ ita &apos;s Dance - in the circle , and a bird wat@@ ery - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators started up stones on police and military post .
when the atmosphere was heated , a command was sent over an internal radio : &quot; when the mass@@ es had more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; says it in a official document of TIME which has not released the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els by En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened risk and called after peace and called the amount to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I was suddenly shot in my left hand , &quot; he said TIME on the por@@ ch of his col@@ ourful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame wh@@ en@@ ever still not , who lik@@ ed , but says that the ball came out of the rows of here were gathered together .
&quot; it was over@@ filled , many shots were fired . &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his co@@ usin , the witness of the dep@@ ortation was .
&quot; I ran@@ ced to him and under@@ went his body to make sure it was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only carries a name , the watch TIME in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot;
the Che@@ ap@@ ist spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de said rep@@ orters that his officers will only be found , &quot; because they were attacked .
&quot; we have to def@@ end us when people threatened to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of the Pap@@ ua police , Comm@@ ission@@ er P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more wounded .
the messages came under the k@@ ill@@ ings only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a pas@@ sion@@ ate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he symp@@ ath@@ ed for families of the victims sold and sw@@ are to t@@ ack@@ le the historical mis@@ sil@@ es in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I would like to be solved now , so that it is no longer going to happen in the future , &quot; he said .
in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he was a exceptional mechan@@ isms to surro@@ gate historical human rights viol@@ ations .
but the talk started almost immediately .
most inju@@ ries passed before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ year .
the point is that we have committed to t@@ ack@@ le them , but there are processes that must pass through . &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto returned a return as he said on June 5 in Jak@@ arta with watch TIME , saying that he had no plans to establish a compl@@ aint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is regul@@ ated , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , accused the UN because of crimes against humanity , who claimed more than 1,000 fat@@ alities in East Timor the blo@@ ody of independence of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights viol@@ ations have already been laid in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai tem@@ plates .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took to meet such claims with un@@ belie@@ v@@ ity .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says he is still alive for years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repe@@ aled the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai will be afraid to discuss the incid@@ ent .
he says he was defeated by the military after he helped four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military came to me , &quot; says he .
the shooting paintings have not heard .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between village residents and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a consci@@ ous man into hospital , died a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old Rav@@ ian@@ us Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unk at a nearby river , and died on the way to the hospital .
independent vill@@ agers in front of the company &apos;s headquarters in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers of stones applied on officers trying to re@@ gre@@ t it .
but int@@ end say that the mobile Brigade ( Indones@@ ian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and sle@@ w a f@@ atal .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that it will be re@@ ven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives in the proximity of the hospital and witness , as the last here were quickly delivered to the TIME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to with@@ draw the officers of the police officers and with@@ draw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai always had an un@@ ru@@ dent man for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Pap@@ ua .
many decided the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( OP@@ M ) , the re@@ bel forces that claims to def@@ end the rights of the Pap@@ ua , carrying spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and demonstr@@ ations of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top OP@@ M leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and ar@@ bit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of the national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some sc@@ uba diving again .
Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a trag@@ ic , forgotten location among people in Pap@@ ua .
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit rice , which is sold to En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for in@@ ev@@ ous .
bread is just except range .
people build here everything they eat : especially N@@ ota and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces N@@ ota cost only 10,000 ind@@ on@@ ese ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
during the period of time , economic dis@@ equ@@ ities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new mig@@ rants , which has arrived since the opening of new flights to the Nab@@ ire airport in the bigger number .
the few jobs that are in the region , go to the better trained and we@@ alth@@ y mig@@ rants .
Pap@@ ua have rarely the capital or the necessary skills to perform their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , the chairman of the family rates of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world from Pap@@ ua .
furthermore , restri@@ ctions of the coverage of the international media are burned .
at the beginning of the year , French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ champ were dep@@ orted due to lack of coordin@@ ation with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare licensed permission was given to films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty of Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign aimed to promote the limit@@ ations of reporting to promote transpar@@ ency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new d@@ ang@@ ers for foreign journalists , trying to report from Indonesia and quiet in a major provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ mo@@ ua : Visa ref@@ uses and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely limited to the immediate neigh@@ bo@@ urs of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March of the six Pacific states - T@@ onga , N@@ aur@@ u , Pal@@ au , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ ders and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; various and widespread inju@@ ries &quot; in Pap@@ ua and the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ wer@@ y .
the same countries have been histor@@ ically supported the OP@@ M .
the spokes@@ person for the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir , said journalist in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media that it is difficult to destroy the evidence of human rights . &quot;
the people want to know that more foreign governments should take care of knowledge .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of human right @-@ Bot@@ es Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , we would like to sei@@ ze liber@@ ties , according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but anon@@ ymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably do not agree again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai treasures , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the Chief Council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people have been seen that it lives under the standing threat of a common military lives in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , and their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; consider that he must pay back .
&quot; you don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and in@@ spiration of the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ ot@@ ub@@ es , a final sym@@ bo@@ lic act of Trot@@ sky@@ ism : the bodies of an o@@ aster was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .
you know that you might never happen to them , but at least she didn &apos;t forget her crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a donated head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
a fire was held on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai , its break@@ book and forced hundreds of inhabitants , out of 337 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that was defeated in just two years , which one has been accid@@ ental in the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , inju@@ ries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .
&quot; we sle@@ pt and we sle@@ pt at the fire of fire and at the cry of the people .
we ran@@ ced the stairs down , and it lasted about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told us , who told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and cool .
the government said they work in the provision of accommodation for those affected .
the incid@@ ent can be used for safety of materials that are used in external areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world , re@@ vers@@ ed .
an investigation through the management of Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of damage caused by a covering , which came for decoration or isolation .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of discs on insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ ade Tower was worn in June to the spread of a burnt @-@ spread of a fire that died about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis associations ( IT@@ F ) is passed through its large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single was only supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup sing@@ les only supported on two chan@@ ces , cover thin of the required two @-@ thir@@ ds majority .
indeed , indeed , often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classi@@ cs remain to the tradition of the tradition .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states agreed for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only barely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are dis@@ appointed that our member will not have the entire re@@ form@@ ations for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historic compet@@ itions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
you will continue to work in order to improve the industry .
not until the vote was not until the vote was already before the proposal , the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 will only be compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists will have the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the first round of the host city .
in order to reduce costs for the organ@@ izer , the requirements in terms of training places etc. makes it easier and players must be completed ahead of the Davis Cup less official media event .
more than 1 out of 5 US travel@@ ers takes b@@ anned objects into plane , take a survey
a survey conducted by flight pass@@ ages that more than 20 percent of deli@@ ber@@ ately deli@@ ber@@ ate or deli@@ ber@@ ately prohib@@ ited objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security administration , including at least 6 per cent , who bet@@ ting the aircraft , while they accid@@ ent@@ ally prohib@@ ited knife or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they have been del@@ ayed that it is ir@@ r@@ ying with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet @-@ charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers more detailed rules .
of those sur@@ vey@@ ed that they have tried to fly with something to fly with something that was b@@ anned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of Millennium Target were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were b@@ anned .
the most common items that are linked to T@@ SA agents , were food and liqu@@ ids .
more than 3 percent said that all objects with blades contributed to security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents agreed that they were deli@@ ber@@ ately managed to take drugs into the aircraft .
the company said , it is sur@@ vey@@ ed in the whole country to find out how many accid@@ ent@@ ally demonstr@@ ating sm@@ ug@@ es by the airport security and how many would have done so much .
it is not a surprise that people who have been most likely to fly on the eh@@ est sm@@ ug@@ es - which were the most frequently fly on the most frequently .
however , the company shows that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little comp@@ lic@@ ated and conf@@ using .
people are often uns@@ ure that ids may take them , or how much of them .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the biggest amount of volumes of T@@ SA are forbidden flu@@ ids .
for a time of long men thinking , the T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ li@@ a@@ ware .
liqu@@ ids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tenth Tes@@ la customers canc@@ el Order
elec@@ tro @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k can be awarded with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has under@@ lined that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their un@@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always tri@@ umph@@ al numbers of sales grow and even gig@@ antic dis@@ orders received Tes@@ la b@@ oss El@@ on Mus@@ k at the announcement of the latest quarters for the first time a second , less smooth figure rates : the cancell@@ ations made for the new mass market 3 .
in the past months , Mus@@ k had frequently asked more than 500.000 pre @-@ orders for the new car which begins ex@@ tradition .
now Mus@@ k now has a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 has already returned .
crit@@ ics still pointed out that it is merely of non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reserv@@ ation payment . &quot;
currently 45@@ 5,000 such un@@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k was sp@@ ati@@ ated in a telephone conference with an@@ alyst@@ s .
if the cancellation of date is supposed to be around twelve percent of all orders to be solved , however , the Tes@@ la b@@ oss believes not .
the argument : the challenge at the ambitious growth rate is not subject to demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tes@@ la 84@@ .000 vehicles delivered .
2018 it will be put to all models - 500.000 , 2020 a million .
demand for this is obviously .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who today is a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can be ordered only in the second half of 2018 , when Tes@@ la creates its brand new , never in practice tested production pun@@ ches with maximum occupancy rate .
many experts dou@@ b@@ ts that this is possible .
however , it comes to greater delay , then the in@@ binding of reservations may be solved the problem for Tes@@ la .
but then the company can un@@ satisfied customers un@@ satisfied customers in Sh@@ ars da@@ .
the EPA b@@ oss P@@ ru@@ itt rein@@ force the rules of the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after having been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , who had the b@@ oss of environmental protection authority , his former decision back to reduce the implementation of the Obama &apos;s era to reduce emissions smo@@ g causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
in order , P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency had inher@@ ited the needs of state environmental agencies , compared with re@@ ac@@ ification faster than previous administration .
he mentioned does not mention the law@@ suit against his previous place in a federal court .
it goes around a term that ran on the 1st of October for States to stop the standards of the G@@ enn@@ ah@@ es Oz@@ on in 2015 .
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would not hes@@ itate to develop a year to study his authority to study the plan to study the plan to study &quot; in local decisions , or economic growth . &quot;
in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , he was a reliable opp@@ onents of environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repe@@ ating repeat@@ edly , regul@@ atory , regul@@ atory , or to dev@@ ouring the chemical industry and industry fossil fuels .
the su@@ dden return of Wednesday is the youngest legal set@@ back for the p@@ ru@@ ction of the rolling @-@ back agenda .
last month , a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ Cup has exceeded its authority , as he tried to have under@@ taken the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reducing meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks .
in a Wednesday evening position , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his swe@@ eping of o@@ zone standards just simply dis@@ continued the read@@ iness of the EPA for cooperation with the United States process of contemporary ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; under an earlier administration , the EPA often did not stop the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting for the implementation of activ@@ ist groups and others , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who compl@@ eting the EPA more than a do@@ zen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation through j@@ uris@@ diction , and we will serious dead@@ lines .
we also accept the law and authority , who gives us , serious . &quot;
nevertheless , the position of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt had any of his &quot; powers to delay and all other legal form , to ensure that the regulations &quot; is based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the conference dr@@ ills a comprehensive re@@ placing of o@@ zone rules .
one of the last month of approved legisl@@ ative study aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years .
the measure was not added to the vote in the Senate .
the New York Att@@ orney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the co@@ alition of the states that had led the EPA in this week , said the group inten@@ ds to just@@ ify the stat@@ ut@@ ory pressure .
&quot; the return of the EPA - after our law@@ suits - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million new Yor@@ kers and those over 115 million Americans that are affected by the smo@@ g , which flows into their par@@ ishes , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York decided in this case California , Conn@@ ecti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Min@@ nes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penns@@ yl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .

representatives of the public health care and environmental cont@@ ested che@@ ered on p@@ ru@@ sting course change@@ over .
&quot; it is troubled , how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we entered into the protection of the air , said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; we must fight against the ide@@ ological cruise campaign of the Tr@@ ump government to fight against environmental awar@@ eness and their particular interests . &quot;

the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be consumed by this powerful place .
the rescue and preserv@@ ation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and spon@@ s@@ ors are made at their concerns .
Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ gy p@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ d chapel was first mentioned in the Wür@@ ttem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ Customer book on the first time : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with which the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eberhard von H@@ orb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document of the document on the Tum@@ linger mountain , except of the former parish church , a rul@@ er yard , belonged to the church , or the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ man , and not vice vers@@ a .

furthermore , the association wants to test wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is &quot; no legal requirement for building and applied to the land Council .
the club &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is ur@@ ged &quot; by land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) , his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association arg@@ uments that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the time in quad@@ ron , a wind power concentration zone has existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are bas@@ ically possible , at the same time the concentration zone has an excl@@ usion of wind energy use for the rest area .
such zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; savings in the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had a few days earlier by a change of the surface planted plan to a second wind turbine zone at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the District government is not approved because of a formation .
&quot; the missing legal requirement is the approval of approval according to the rights of rights and therefore , Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; said . &quot;
current state of the things : the city council has taken again the wind concentration camp in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a constitution of the District government is still alive .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; thus , this is the release of a approval for the construction of wind energy plants as planned . &quot;
the circle confirms the input of the In@@ vit@@ ation .
&quot; the appropriate writing have been received since VER@@ GAN@@ GEN@@ ER Week at the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; explained a speaker .
the circle takes you to the occasion , to prove the matter .
however , it is not expected to continue that the procedure is stopped .
with a glance at the administration court in the court , the circle on Thursday wanted to re@@ tain the presentation of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim of the Association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning to build a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high .
already last year , the company had been involved in the city of Vier@@ sen . P@@ acht@@ ver@@ orders with the owners of about 65 hectares of land closed .
with the construction of four wind energy systems , the power requirement of around 11 400 households will be covered - this is equivalent to around one @-@ fifth of all four@@ ths of households .
the NEW plan will invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , the city council gave a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch in Aachen , as well as a participation in an wind energy system in Ü@@ bach @-@ P@@ alen@@ berg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

drinking water after tran@@ scrip@@ ted tran@@ scription by telephone call Mexico under pressure because of payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and management of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump resulted in a telephone at the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to tell that he would not pay for a planned limit wall .
the U.S. president sei@@ zed him , because he had publicly trad@@ ed the Wall publicly , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his pre@@ sidency campaign with the promise to er@@ ect a wall in the southern border of the USA , and flu@@ ori@@ de , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first An@@ ru@@ fs with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a set aside .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ ass said that a trade for the United States refugees forced to take over Australia , &quot; mies , &quot; and &quot; st@@ up@@ m &quot; and that the existence of the government had been trying to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban in transformation of refugees to the US .

Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ massacre : activ@@ ists conduct rapidly Lyn@@ ch@@ act as call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury came by a group of vie@@ wers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and r@@ ump@@ ed on the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came in order to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man average age in a con@@ if@@ er suit - took a long train at its c@@ ig@@ ar , looked after the wind@@ screen .
inside sh@@ ep@@ ed the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ anded the man . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
in silence , when a young black man was torn down from the driver &apos;s seat .
fortunately , this terri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22 , only a reproduction .
but when a sn@@ are thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all of them are very true sin@@ e@@ zer .
since 2005 , Mayor of the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was indicted because of the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it is really unknown , that in all these years , no single person was arrested , although we know them in our con@@ greg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks which helps in the organization of the delivery .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 year old former congress of the state Georgia and a long citizen .
it serves as a dram@@ atic call for hands , and is an annual memory of the Monroe @-@ community that an un@@ righteous has never been correc@@ ted .
&quot; we want the pro@@ secution , we want the damage , we want to re@@ conc@@ iliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can not get to healing and re@@ conc@@ iliation , until we received righteousness . &quot;
a j@@ uris@@ diction is a bed linen on the suffer@@ ers of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ge on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI Act , which have been received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were susp@@ ected from Monroe and the surrounding County in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none was charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , civil just@@ if@@ ies that the double motiv@@ ation is known for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court bought the black citizens in Georgia to make their vote in the summer .
about at the same time as the choice st@@ ach , according to F@@ BI , Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , while a struggle against a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that H@@ ester was in the city that H@@ ester had sle@@ pt with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and saw the baby , which she carried out of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison paid a promin@@ ent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Co@@ us@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in jail .
but when she was removed from prison , and the Moore &apos; s Ford Bridge , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b car .
&quot; how it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared the Mor@@ de , which includes a F@@ BI report .
&quot; it is also ob@@ vious that there was a con@@ spir@@ acy between government and local pro@@ secution , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence and destroy the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more distinc@@ tive .
&quot; it was a election law , &quot; he said .
&quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
for almost a decade of Cass@@ andra , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual report of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her depic@@ tion is not@@ ice@@ ably , deli@@ ber@@ ately and is just@@ ified in a kind of deep@@ est R@@ ass@@ ism , who would like to believe that he is no longer there in America .
it is difficult to watch and more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we &apos;ll be con@@ fron@@ ted with Him in all con@@ fron@@ ts , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or hear what I have done . &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a do@@ zen of white and the rest of black - in a room and loud as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ looking overview about the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he played the role of b@@ oss @-@ C@@ lan@@ member &apos;s role for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dir@@ ty , because I &apos;m not so bin , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story of life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the space , the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester , and p@@ ushed it on him that he sle@@ pt with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- er , dis@@ win@@ der of my possession ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona re@@ signs the fire .
there is a break .
and then , everyone ( at least all the black actor ) breaks out .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the loud sound .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; then sh@@ avers asked .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always welcome .
&quot; I don &apos;t think that white people said &apos; n --- &quot; &apos; . &quot;
&quot; however , &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black int@@ est@@ ers .
&quot; you must only listen to the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
and precisely , the energy in the room , a feeling of camera v@@ ents replaced the accident .
everybody is bus@@ y to get this really , not just because of the game , but also due to the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sp@@ icy and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one lau@@ gh .
this repe@@ ater is violent and quickly .
there are fri@@ es , shots and then silence .
a woman with a marriage dress , stands out about the bodies of actor and leads Che@@ e Holidays Trau@@ ma de Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; .
your voice breaks in every second word .
about 100 metres behind this , a group of about four do@@ zens of vie@@ wers swe@@ at and te@@ ars made out of the eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between Black and White .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street only .
they have experienced every eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ pressing moisture when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgri@@ m@@ age to Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de stayed a An@@ ci@@ d@@ ote but now , when you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de came , fe@@ els the air .
when the last score of the songs loads gre@@ ens the quantity to come closer and sur@@ name the body fil@@ ename .
children ho@@ b@@ ells in their heads , register the counter@@ feit blood and s@@ caff@@ ol@@ ing body and fl@@ yers to each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy when he like to remember it .
after a couple of minutes , Gre@@ ene of the quantity - and suddenly it is over .
the actors take the Lyn@@ x road and we@@ gian their te@@ ars .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the founder member .
Nick Ras@@ cona surrounded two of his co @-@ player and breaks down in their arms , the emot@@ ional load trig@@ gered by him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; des@@ olate one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this from a reason . &quot;
later the audience with the actors to dinner together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta prev@@ ail@@ ed over the desc@@ endants with a black couple , which they just have to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought the way to find words that feel the performance .
&quot; it is difficult to hear these terri@@ ble words and acts ... of people who like yourself and they will do , because they look like it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really do with me , it makes me think that the Lyn@@ ches still goes further , &quot; added it today , &quot; today it will be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof is working on his table , he e@@ ats and remin@@ is@@ cent of the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the delivery is inspired by a certain way , because she describes the terror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s so if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not studies his own history , who does not know his own history is to repeat them to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ t@@ ter@@ däm@@ m@@ erung &quot; conc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ aner in Bay@@ re@@ uth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s ex works , director Frank Cast@@ orf is based on a color@@ ful fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of gig@@ antic , six @-@ story scenery .
the script ( designed by Ale@@ k@@ san@@ dar Den@@ ic ) illustr@@ ates an independent street corner with a laying and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .

in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ellen@@ ic concert in 2013 , there were five years later , there were five years later , in which the law@@ ful &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; were interrup@@ ted .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have lik@@ ed about this .
&quot; we consider that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in certain manner , &quot; she had said just before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also a understanding of its vision .
I go a positive rescue .

EPA returns to the delay of smo@@ g rule after compl@@ aints ?
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to dev@@ oured a government regulation of Obama , raised to assass@@ inate the States , smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency for the st@@ epper .

&quot; we believe in dialogue with and to re@@ mind that we re@@ act to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a declaration .

although it is still going to date , until the parish of the church is owned by the Church of the Church , but there is no plans for a private invest@@ or to st@@ em@@ men@@ de project .
there is a discussion concerning a joint venture .
one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has offered the church .
on the ground floor , he would have a living space - around 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square metres of area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council is floating before , such a common space is just not considered the meeting point for the residents of sen@@ iors , but open to the congregation .
as an example , the word was made by the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; round .
the decision to pass through the provision of funding from the current budget for the current budget already in the past autumn .
construction is in the san@@ itation area .
the establishment of a community area would be reported , such as T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 per cent of 30 percent .
the decision attri@@ bute to sign@@ ation to the Invest@@ or , that one would not have any c@@ ud@@ geon between the legs that is le@@ ver@@ ing that both the sem@@ it@@ ra@@ - - which reduces the ambient level - what the tr@@ acking height reduces and construction economic power - can be possible .
un@@ necessary , if not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , this supplement is not necessary .
when it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously it happened to the panel .
it is not as simple as the common room .
Daniela rep@@ utation refers to the many of its own building , with which one is not right to come in a common room from the window , says : &quot; I do it difficult to do so . &quot;
Yv@@ onne Sta@@ iger promises to communic@@ ate for community space - but absolutely against a commun@@ al participation .
she looks behind a covered sub@@ sid@@ y on wards or more Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of an area , no supplements , but get a real , in the tw@@ ist fall , reads the counter@@ s .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s application , compl@@ ying the decisions in the compl@@ aint , finds three fe@@ ars .
so it remains in two counter@@ parts at the original program that Stefan H@@ aller thus sum@@ mar@@ izes : &quot; if we have the decision so , we make a huge step forward to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

in the Harz Mountains on Star
the country@@ wide first &quot; star ad &quot; should be created in the Harz Mountains .
this plan of the club Stern@@ war@@ te Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a Plan@@ etary path takes place in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; Stern@@ en@@ Path &quot; will meet the information in many har@@ z@@ ic visitors , named it .
it is nature , science , movement and sport@@ y performance .
members want to walk along the planned route tables and inform@@ s about stars and star images .
in the first phase up to 2018 , the association &quot; well achie@@ vable installations in five to six places &quot; in the Ober@@ harz .
inqu@@ ire of St Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on boards are to be completed by the Internet .
therefore , in the site selection , a good mobile network receive a roll .
Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star g@@ ad train should be expanded by train .
&quot; on the Stern@@ en@@ chan@@ ad learn the viewer much knowledge about the physi@@ cs of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned to have different colors as different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , though he is much further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star , where he was best to see at the best time .
the association has been running since 2014 in the town of St Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest @-@ star cluster in Northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the national park of resin , counts according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , six dark regions in Germany .
often from the da@@ iry street and even the And@@ rom@@ eda Galaxy with the naked eye is clearly visible .
since 2003 , there has been a little simil@@ ar@@ ity in the University of Go@@ et@@ arium , a somewhat simil@@ ar@@ ful as planned ob@@ serv@@ atory - the plan@@ etary path since 2003 .
starting before Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , leading the plan@@ etary way up to Hain@@ berg and to the con@@ stellation - as well as a &quot; extraordinary &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( congregation ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the sho@@ ots of the plan@@ ets - including the plan@@ ets of the plan@@ ets plan@@ ets Pl@@ uto at the end point - are exactly in the space and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ shr@@ unk so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away the sun measures 70 centi@@ meters .
the entire distance of the planet is good four kilometers .
while the light of Sun up to the pl@@ uto takes about eight hours , pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans need a good one hour until the stack of Pl@@ uto .
thus , pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the world .
the march to the next F@@ ate however would last another year .

four Sp@@ aces to tire plat@@ ter
in an accident on the A7 , four people were seri@@ ously wounded by a accident on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Zaf@@ ira was lost to 4.30 p.m. in front of the wiring area , probably after a tire plat@@ ter the control via his vehicle .
the car sh@@ ri@@ ched to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sm@@ ote himself and then remained on the roof in the bottom .
four occup@@ ants are injured - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the change by the rescue service , A7 towards the north for about an hour was locked , then the traffic on the left to be di@@ vor@@ ced by the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ ier@@ chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann ho@@ ur@@ bed after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener to Braunschweig for the optimi@@ zation of the de@@ formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season finale , Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , as they were not the two counter@@ doors at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; that were two opp@@ onents to have much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ endant of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebir@@ ge , the tri@@ cycle chain is also improved .
and a gate after a free result , the Fort@@ una will no longer be caught .
&quot; for the future it will be so there is no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right in preparation with the triple chain , better than with the quad@@ ruple chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we are in Au@@ e , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ position chain at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Cast@@ ß@@ elmann players who can build well . &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but we are even more harmon@@ ise and we are not able to aff@@ ord ourselves in the construction . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; if you don &apos;t talk after an accident of a miss@@ al start , do not know .
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; meant Hoffmann .
&quot; if we are standing on Sunday with four points , we can focus on the cup , we will surely be able to talk of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
of it wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start to the season I only would like to speak just after six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of a advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken in early due for an un@@ w@@ et@@ ters .
&quot; now they can start the season qu@@ asi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann may believe that the player from Au@@ e could even be some fresh , since they had no heav@@ iest and complete game like Fort@@ una against a p@@ ending fav@@ or@@ ites in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ ending champion of Fort@@ una .
indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a slight fav@@ or@@ ites on Sunday into the meeting at the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we may take them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six years , blood @-@ sense , &quot; says the radio , whose balance is consist@@ ently positive in just a loss of nine .
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga which have to beat from vor@@ n@@ her@@ ein , &quot; explains Fort@@ ress Ch@@ ef@@ coach .
&quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and over@@ he@@ al . &quot;
and so don &apos;t want to see his player on Sunday on Sunday .
new Results of the Swedish As@@ yl@@ an evaluation tests
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been sub@@ jected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the measured people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of this results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( Qu@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
they are supposed to be more specific during the age of age due to the estim@@ ation of the age ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ em@@ et ) due to errors during the assessment of the correct age of some refugees , who were min@@ der@@ age of age .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ em@@ et 6.@@ 880 has shipped to test@@ ig@@ ent cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests dating from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated more than 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency ass@@ essed that the person could possibly be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is probably under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the ages of the person is set to question .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant in recent months .
&quot; we do not see no difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the journal The Local .
the high proportion of cases , in which the person was judged to be above 18 years , does not mean that the asylum seek@@ ers over his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there will be 442 cases , the &quot; vor@@ ce that the subject would be 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det made the 5@@ 81 results published , they found that in 243 of these cases the person had already said that it will be 18 years old in this year .
the method of medic@@ inal evalu@@ ations , during the rati@@ os of cons@@ ult and MR@@ I recordings are made of buttons , which are analys@@ ed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ ocr@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska @-@ Institute whose work carried out the assessment of biological fri@@ ction of men , to see if they had earlier or later as usually by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
this biological age to ass@@ ess this way , is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
by Gö@@ ran@@ sson by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , they can say that the risk of one child is un@@ true .
the largest risk is in it if the person is under 18 , this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;

the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Schr@@ am@@ berg come well ahead .

Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks about her bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese , and will eat it to the end of their life .
but I would like to try all things , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart completely open about their bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
&quot; if I love one in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool what comes as a neigh@@ bour ? &apos; .
the most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was the one of her &quot; Tw@@ il@@ ight &quot; colleagues of Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ulti@@ mat@@ ely turned out bitter .

especially among them suffered them according to &quot; B@@ ang show@@ biz &quot; but in the school time when they were rather than a Bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
it really has really hurt me .
when I was eleven said the children I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , dis@@ rup@@ ted and dis@@ appointed .
now I return and think to me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public explained , they don &apos;t like love to love , &quot; the people expect you for a certain way , and the off@@ ended me . &quot;
and perhaps I may have some und@@ ank@@ ful , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify me from the whole public . &quot;

thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats at the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was vice vers@@ a .

Stephan W@@ eil still maint@@ ains un@@ de@@ able that the Land@@ tag is possible to read its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further procedure .
the state rec@@ alls also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s country pre@@ sidents are dra@@ ws and cho@@ oses the successor to the Prime Minister .
&quot; our Constitution offers multiple options .

agriculture , Minister for Agriculture - How do we protect us from Gif@@ ts , Lord Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about ver@@ se@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can the consumer protect .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) Minister for Agriculture ( CS@@ U ) in an interview with the edit@@ orial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect eggs from po@@ ison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encour@@ age all consumer products and consumer , to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check out the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ od@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de represent the fore@@ ign@@ ers the most recent eggs various information about the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we know what we currently know , a health haz@@ ard@@ ous is practi@@ cally impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis action - all eggs are from the offer - because the central role of the Federal Minister of Justice will not really been perc@@ eived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has un@@ covered , and it has been un@@ necessary since conf@@ usion in Germany &apos;s strict exchange with the authorities of countries .
all information and the risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade has the same as the manufacturers to conc@@ ern that the sold products are able to per@@ me@@ able and health haz@@ ard@@ ous .
if at the eggs of the resi@@ du@@ al thickness of 0,@@ 005@@ mg / kg , this is not able to transport .
un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and hon@@ oured .
this time are not the establ@@ ish@@ ments .
sitting production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
after the current knowledge of knowledge , there are no direct gu@@ ilt in production .
instead , they must count due to the relevant illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there are too little inspec@@ tions in harvest .
is it missing only on the staff , or on the key j@@ uris@@ diction ?
there were just the official controls who have covered the process .
however , the food was also heard that food and dis@@ cri@@ mination had never be excluded as 100 percent .
just therefore , a consistent exc@@ it@@ ment of such bodies , and the hand@@ over to the public pro@@ secution in cases where off@@ ences can be careful of cru@@ cial importance .
I have already made many times more than I expect from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumer prices and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and commercial foods .
if a non @-@ approved in@@ sec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des in the food industry is used , consumer prices and consumers are just@@ ified .
in order , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are ger@@ ated into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
bas@@ ically must be clear : the human rights use of the in@@ sec@@ ti@@ z@@ ids Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il is not h@@ inn@@ ed and must not be ended immediately .
it has to be consist@@ ently worked on all levels and worked with high pressure .
I expect from all the compet@@ ent authorities that the experts were able to be dis@@ missed and l@@ ure .
how the financial rules of the football matches on Ne@@ ym@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered expend@@ itu@@ res of European football , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spain for the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain in Spain .
some consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain by the UEFA Champions , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has overcome the power to for@@ bid the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which have been established in 2011 by UEFA European Life , that PS@@ G would have been claimed that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was fin@@ anced without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar is receiving a sal@@ ary that will amount to $ 10 million a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make security of the money , in order to sign Ne@@ ym@@ ar and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the rich rul@@ ing family of Qatar .
there may have a lot of money to purchase a lot of money , but must con@@ serve with leg@@ itim@@ ate income sources , which allow them to enable the break @-@ even point in their respective business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French players believed that betra@@ yed in their sp@@ reads after success of trem@@ end@@ ous debt had taken care , effectively fr@@ ying and ris@@ k@@ ened , when banks or owner passed their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P lost its concentration to the deb@@ ts of clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the amend@@ ment was meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then invested strongly to build the crew and to build a global stamp - a toug@@ h@@ est matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 is fallen by the Pre@@ sidency in In@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to re@@ cover its expend@@ itu@@ res .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , opposite the Associ@@ ated Press in the last week .
although PS@@ G paid the Buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package deal , it can distri@@ bute the amount for invo@@ ice over the duration of his contract .
in addition , Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five year contract , so that the sizes for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.1 million euros can be expressed in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has reached the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the heav@@ iest sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was reduced to 20 million euros and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players in the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEFA is looking for clubs , trying to over@@ hau@@ led their financial statements by companies that are linked to own@@ ership of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could exceed the PS@@ G spon@@ s@@ ors , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship should not exceed the default market rates , the UEFA these would not be considered a leg@@ itim@@ ate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the PS@@ A spon@@ sor@@ ship of the PS@@ A in Qatar was recorded .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come over payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have announced that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM @-@ Ambassador will become am@@ bassador and a global man@@ eu@@ ver for the UEFA regul@@ atory authorities simply could find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA still will be atten@@ tively , any attempt to see the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory con@@ vers@@ ations with PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said among the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with the Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not commanded to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of 54@@ 2.4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expected that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , merch@@ and@@ ising and Jersey .
the association goes out that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent by the signing of the signing .
the Spanish League was just irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player to see , and she attemp@@ ted to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ns , trying to prevent PS@@ G the FF@@ P inj@@ ury .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; finance d@@ op@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose association is owned by the US Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , share the prevention of La Liga against a state that fin@@ anced an association .
&quot; it is the consequ@@ ence of the own@@ ership and this has complete the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday .
as soon as a country owns a club , everything is possible .
it &apos;s very difficult to respect the financing Fair@@ play because you can make different ways or different interests , if a country has a great act to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ g@@ il@@ ie@@ fer@@ ant
in the past years , choc@@ ol@@ at has produced fre@@ y onboard @-@ chocolate for Swiss .
now the s@@ uts collabor@@ ated in front of a possible end : the airline writes the contract .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ r@@ ott confirmed the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west schwei@@ z Zeitung on request .
according to current planning , airline will concl@@ ude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and sub@@ jected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said spokes@@ person .
about 17 million small red white wrapped tro@@ og@@ ging out of 14 gram distri@@ bute the passengers in front of the passengers .
on the cost , Swiss does not wanted to do any information .
industry commission estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; North western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieved an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
nevertheless more important is the advertising effect : for a shame manufacturer , it is a prestigious order .
how many applic@@ ants gives it to the new announcement , the Swiss will not be betra@@ yed .
but in question only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper article , choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of contract on the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate paste wasn &apos;t accessible for a statement .
chocolate bars distributed in Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss Life concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut delivered the chocolate tablet in cooperation with Hu@@ g .

nost@@ alg@@ ia Nostalg@@ ia &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective &quot; into the N@@ ic
this rep@@ et@@ ition of the story is nost@@ alg@@ ic because of the gl@@ or@@ ful days of characters from the 80 @-@ er years , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things .
as cultural species , it is equally a par@@ ody and a sal@@ es@@ per@@ sion of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but when Fran@@ ch@@ ise fe@@ els like it fe@@ els the time .
&quot; First Day of Camp &quot; was sur@@ pris@@ ingly good , not just because of his ab@@ sur@@ the hum@@ ors ( it contained a original history for speaking vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by cli@@ cking on the core of the gate - actor average age to play children who are grown to grow - they still managed to win the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emot@@ ionally dist@@ ur@@ bed , and his par@@ ody goes on the stal@@ k movies of the 90 &apos;s , like &quot; The hand That Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The hand , the cr@@ adle &quot; ) .
at a point , a character by a Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lov@@ able Coo@@ p ( Mr. Show alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite More@@ au ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost its vir@@ gins .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , in the Ronald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
like always the exchange rates of the best part of Fran@@ ch@@ ise .
it makes especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d to see the Matt Dill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Singles &quot; shows whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now felt like an old boy .
there are the mom@@ ents chance to heat this fr@@ action like a kind of repeated &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieved as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene is to show the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective &quot; to Amazon , a different kind of nost@@ alg@@ ia : &quot; The Americans , &quot; at the film &quot; Atomic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its East against West Ring@@ athlon I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created his com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , two officers of the eigh@@ ties as friends , two officers from Bucharest , to fight for truth , A@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main trol@@ ls - a hard @-@ tail@@ ored Gregor and an ideal I@@ os@@ ef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alog@@ ues of chann@@ el@@ Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice gig to see ( the police brings the time to watch chess in television , how Americans are going to do with football ) .
and the list of famous speaker - including J@@ enny Sl@@ ate , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ ersh@@ al@@ Ali and Chlo@@ ë Sev@@ ign@@ y - ensures an independent game &apos; find the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective &quot; is committed so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a bran@@ ched prop@@ ag@@ anda dr@@ ama - a mur@@ derer who carries a re@@ agent mask is covered that it often plays a single one .
there is a long episodes for six episodes , and the trag@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective , &quot; who became a lower length , could visit his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef is still the American em@@ bass@@ y , whose lobby is still occupied by two di@@ cken men that are scr@@ apped by a bunch of Hamburg .
the em@@ bass@@ y for the imag@@ in@@ ated commun@@ ist audience is that the Western culture can do everything for a v@@ age .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators were not false : we even make it even with our own more recent history and with the ih@@ in@@ ent history .
impact against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police have a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Const@@ ance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects searched for the public pro@@ secutor of Const@@ ance on Friday .
during this time , 15 people were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials ordered larger amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time , Ra@@ zz@@ ia were arrested in Italy two persons .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two verd@@ ant Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore expected to be shipped to Germany .
in action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were dep@@ loyment .
the ma@@ f@@ ia members organized a drug dis@@ cri@@ ality , severe violence , su@@ bre@@ ed murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ex@@ press@@ ors .
since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor of Const@@ ance was established in the southern German space .
between the public pro@@ secutor in Const@@ ance and Palermo , a real exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
thus , the big mission was accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo .
in particular , Italian citizens joined the Italian Maf@@ ia in particular with regards to Italian ma@@ f@@ ia .
a incid@@ ent on May 27 , at the early morning , several shots were fired at a host@@ ile in the early morning , likely to go to the Ban@@ de &apos;s account .
manner of compl@@ ains great l@@ ut@@ ches in the fore@@ ign@@ ers register
&quot; data of citizens , which should not be sc@@ uba diving &quot; : a report said that the fore@@ ign@@ ers register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings .
the lead to part of serious mis@@ decisions at asylum procedures .
according to the Federal Government for the Federal Government of the Federal Government of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen became a media report according to major g@@ aps in the out@@ line register .
M@@ än@@ gel at all registered data could lead to part in asylum procedures and dep@@ ortation , &quot; in an analysis in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutschen Zeitung &quot; was presented .
according to the register , ten million people of foreign citizens are recorded , including some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will be administ@@ rated by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been well maintained , the data quality in parts have not been good .
in detail , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who became a long live longer alive , or of citizens who are a citizen of citizens and in the register no more . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data acquisition , recovery processes can significantly slow down , &quot; says the report after .
statistics of the statistics about foreign citizens are affected by EU citizens , which should not have to travel .
these fal@@ cons led &quot; to a dist@@ err@@ ated debate on the dealing with ex@@ trav@@ ellers , &quot; means it is in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously began to go back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children again after Italy , when they went away from there .
this will come from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Re@@ fuge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; New Oz@@ ol@@ ines Re@@ quest@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
in the paper it is called &quot; for families with children , except for families with children , except for inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants , to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practi@@ cally no longer been possible , the newspaper below reference to the difficult situation in the spot .
after the Dublin agreement , the EU @-@ State is responsible for refugees from the EU @-@ State .
if a mig@@ rant pass through another EU country , this state may send him back into the shopping eland .
the Office write the office now : &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy significantly increased . &quot;
Italy have been released for accept@@ ing and accomodation of families .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the atten@@ u@@ ation of inflation the spec@@ ulations have turned over an increase .
the Bank of England has war@@ ned that the economic growth &quot; will remain &quot; when she met interest rates on family income in the middle of a boost pressure .
the Bank decision makers of the Mon@@ etary Committee ( MP@@ C ) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 , with the interest rates to 0.25 % , with this month less members rise an increase , since the weak economic growth has been weak@@ ened for increasing poverty .
in its fourth @-@ annual inflation forecast for 2017 , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 % and in 2018 it would continue to continue to continue the pressure on the household income , with the inflation in the fall is expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years of interest , inflation would be bre@@ d to bre@@ d by the Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s inflation and said that the lending costs may be more than expected to rise to financial markets .
the members also voted to with@@ draw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package that was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for financial statements to provide the financial assets for banks , although it is said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
minutes after the decision on the rate of interest , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of MP@@ C remains weak in the short term , because the pressure on the real @-@ income of households will continue to use the consumption . &quot;
on the interest rates repeated , they repeated that &quot; a certain date of monetary policy &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent would be needed when the markets are expected .
the markets currently anticip@@ ate the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the bank st@@ ressed that the increases &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; will be done . &quot;
according to the revised growth forecast for this and next year , the Bank predicted 1.9 % and 1.7 % in comparison to the next year .
she has reduced its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the youngest dis@@ appo@@ inting growth , increasing demands on an interest rate and prev@@ ented the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will be easily recovered after the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered a little enthusi@@ asm for households which will be affected by an increasing inflation and less@@ er extent , because the pro@@ secution first is even worse before they will rep@@ ent .
they added that the monetary policy in the next years does not prevent the income break , &quot; but they added that the wages paid for the end of their three @-@ year gn@@ osis . &quot;
the economy is also increased by increasing demand for British quality , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which is part of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes to a year after ste@@ aring of interest rates for 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ ck@@ eting EU tuning , which caused the left of the p@@ ine@@ ole .
the bank estimates that it is likely to last four years , until this will reach the prices and economy .
prior to the final judgment of the Bank , the rep@@ utation has risen to the interest rate since the inflation had increased pressure to hard households , with three political decision makers in July an increase to 0.5 % .
the inflation was reduced from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in the past month , although the Bank said that this was expected to re@@ claim it again in the next months .
the Bank said the trans@@ gression in relation to their target of 2 % &quot; will be &quot; quite &quot; to the weak Po@@ und .
Andrew Mont@@ br@@ ine , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shorter decline of sw@@ ap @-@ rates , the mort@@ gage market is more competitive , because the lending is looking for more competitive and end the year in positive way .
the market looks particularly well for those who include the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health care ) is intended to drive HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people .
from September after a fight against the high Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention cancer .
N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual inter@@ course was imp@@ acted by pre@@ diction ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the inf@@ usion risk of high risk cancer by around 86 percent , now shipping the health service via a first three @-@ year study for 10.000 people .
he declared ready to finance the process , after the App@@ eals Court confirmed the verdict in the last year , that the N@@ HS had confirmed the power to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities have to finance it .
on Thursday announced chess has been welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first include en@@ abling people , and other clin@@ ics will follow in October , before it will be launched in the whole of England in April 2018 .
prevention ( pre@@ p ) is a consequ@@ ence of HIV prepar@@ es that will be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p was significantly reduced the HIV transmission in case of infection .
pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course , means that just enough medication should be present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or as two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
among those who come to question in question , are pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners that were not successfully treated .
in clin@@ ics , suitable participants identif@@ ies the study , including men , women , trans@@ gender and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who registered in England and are registered with a home doctor in England , can also register for a possible participation in their local sex life .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medicines in this week after an international competitive pro@@ cu@@ rement .
the study aims to ass@@ ess the entire potential of pre@@ p by combin@@ ing clinical trials , as it is applied in a large scale , taken and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV and re@@ cover .
it is another milestone in which more than three decades to conduct progress in favour of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive Officer ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a cru@@ cial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p when it is aimed at need@@ y and end@@ ang@@ ered people , the possibility to change the English HIV epidem@@ ic .
from September to September people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ fin@@ anced attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner that leads to improve many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out in the whole country , and no one has left the risk of HIV .
now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , sh@@ adows @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of pre@@ p process is due to monthly delay and encour@@ age implementation through the government and over@@ due .
the evidence showing how trans@@ form@@ ative that drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of these life @-@ changing infection .
this try to give us a step closer to the advantages of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible in the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected people , and that it is possible to achieve evidence of HIV in society &apos;s account a step closer .
the big life live : mezzanine and cle@@ ver designers @-@ tri@@ cks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a gener@@ ous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , renovated in 2014 by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne had not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before I was living with my Ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ce@@ il@@ ings .
I love me in love and made a special offer for this day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet was completely over@@ hau@@ led completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a det@@ ach@@ able layout - we had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne St@@ aur@@ aum and a mezzanine to use the gener@@ ous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ce@@ il@@ ings , large windows , much light .
that was my request , &quot; says it .
to this purpose , she assigned the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , to use 12.5 feet high ce@@ il@@ ings and to create a home , not just a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne was also .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so the architectural challenge was on to create a mezzanine , where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative , to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite comp@@ lic@@ ated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms that they were st@@ acked with each other , without that we had to move up .
it wasn &apos;t just to build a simple platform , but to put the steel that it had the correct height for the top or below . &quot;
this arrangement gives the opportunity to place two rooms in full height , with a lot of additional dr@@ ama .
for the mezzanine with a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us view over the gl@@ am@@ our@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting stands the style for the program .
the use of Sp@@ ie@@ ves plays an role in adding theatre , room , and light .
on both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen fe@@ els like a window as a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by the perc@@ eption of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can termin@@ ated the kitchen when it is not used .
folding kit@@ chens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is around a garage .
&quot; a bit of engineering firm went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ ated MDF door .
&quot; it is mut@@ ually important , so that if you have the door of high , very light . &quot;
thanks to the CLE@@ VER@@ DE usage of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne was able to win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
in a ru@@ dim@@ entary form , a real estate agent is attached and a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they have managed to en@@ large the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that create the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch , and therefore help to create a emot@@ ional eng@@ agement in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electric sockets in walls .
they are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment is characterized by a good design and increased square met@@ er@@ ical value of something standard in something very aston@@ ishment .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide to leave this not .
brothers are fighting for a 500 million real estate markets
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family established the Dynast@@ y family , in a med@@ itation because of one of the largest property in Vic@@ tori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clar@@ ify how ye own@@ ership and its business power .
Paul wanted to with@@ draw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp disp@@ ute concerning the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers bought 38 list@@ ings in value of more than half a billion dollars , accum@@ ulated ever since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co Jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail business .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast , and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centres in the suburbs .
after an agreement with their de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in is described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ant person@@ ality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two @-@ thir@@ ds of the company &apos;s office and Paul about one third .
an initial file that Col@@ in has resulted in the value of $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven itself for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the dep@@ ilation of Col@@ in proposed ess@@ ments have him with the back , what I made for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in the first aff@@ ida@@ v@@ it in 2015 .
last Friday , after several failed investigation , the first appro@@ aching of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
brothers now even struggle over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims that excluded it .
Col@@ in arg@@ um@@ ented , this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul before , some occup@@ ying ink@@ en@@ ings .
in an early aff@@ ida@@ v@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to join the battle .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with affili@@ ida@@ v@@ its , e @-@ ma@@ ils and reports of companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading law@@ yers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides persist@@ s p@@ ending machines .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rant , the da@@ iry bars and delic@@ acy business from the late 1950 @-@ 20 years ago , and in the early sevent@@ y years a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Lie@@ gen@@ ship , opened in Col@@ in the first je@@ ans@@ ing family .
Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co there , when he was &quot; in my last years of the High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis tells us that she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , tru@@ sted her property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi told me often that he had never wanted to landing that the brothers before Tribunal wrote , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not more part of the De Lu@@ tis group , Col@@ in claims that Mark rep@@ aid at the company &apos;s 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
in both Luke and Mark , Paul , &quot; says Paul , &quot; the conditions of their financial separation has become bitter . &quot;
Col@@ in has held very returned , although it was a former A@@ FL board member and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the Best Friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their law@@ yers .
only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; I can really say much say , &quot; because the case is before the court .
&quot; it is very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to ver@@ ify me and to draw our family name by the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in was written in a writing to the court that he tried to ful@@ fil the requirements of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have won that Paul and I would end in our current disp@@ ute , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he will still trust in one solution . &quot;
on Friday , this hope is over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; Col@@ in .
Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff is planning to restri@@ ct the media origin of the president .
others have tried and are failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , it will be the first .
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to satis@@ fy the information flow on President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the b@@ oss on a more uniform course .
here is a copy of Rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , he set up a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he would like to repair the wool : poor information that entered into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the staff that information should be sent - whether on paper or in brie@@ fing - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ it@@ ish diagnostic makes sense , but others have attemp@@ ts to monitor Tr@@ ump to watch out his media .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship for television is sufficient for decades - and now where he is in the White House , is still strong .
&quot; if candidates was off@@ ended because of a un@@ fair report , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were con@@ vin@@ ce , &quot; said the former electoral campaign Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO .
polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter sp@@ ati@@ es under control , according to six former electoral campaign to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a permanent lo@@ dge . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ its ever &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this camp@@ a@@ ign@@ s know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ et does not contain any of the inter@@ ventions even more ignition .
we will never know something about the Twe@@ et that Tr@@ ump does not have sent .
if his staff members knew it already some times , trouble of him will be re@@ warded with him , then their effort was re@@ warded .
but no one has to prevent it consist@@ ently causes that Tr@@ ump contro@@ versi@@ es .
a part of the problem exists that people in a wil@@ low house which turns out of con@@ cent@@ ering parties , trying to present their own agenda , giving up their own views from the world , possibly its views from the world .
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO - a whole story with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ sidents of advis@@ or , to introduce the president of strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ civil servants say that Tr@@ ump can re@@ act as a vol@@ cano in negative press photos , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he could find out to find out of these things .
exactly this happened at the end of February when som@@ eb@@ ody was accused of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , accused of his dep@@ uty Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been missed due to sch@@ ik@@ es from Twitter , or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he did not ut@@ terly ut@@ terly ut@@ terly in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees over Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ maker added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce P@@ rieb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to manage a system to manage the paper , to manage the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it be folded ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as P@@ rieb@@ ke , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors are still subject to influence .
this un@@ changeable factors reve@@ aling the Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .

some of the we@@ alth@@ iest household owner of the West Mi@@ dl@@ ands are back with some des@@ il@@ ted travel@@ ers to war , which have taken one of the community which have drawn up a field before their rul@@ ing houses .
the travel@@ ers have called its 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside the we@@ alth@@ y road of Soli@@ ds , which is called &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies , and an army of transportation , after she had been cast out in May they had been cast down from a council which had been carried out by the Council , however , to prevent their dis@@ ast@@ es .
the tak@@ est group found a gap in the defence and op@@ pressed their vehicles by a section , which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
Ramp@@ ager &apos;s inhabitants have p@@ ushed the Council of Soli@@ ds , the told that it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anon@@ ymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; you have moved on the Monday evening after she was sent to Bentley He@@ ath where stones have thrown onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced to be forced into action in fact , since he was able to use the problem with the problem .
the travel@@ ers were in May there , were moved , and are now back again .
more we arrived last night , probably today more . &quot;
they added to : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how one goes to protect your parks in order to protect your parks .
I live at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my common charge if the Council could not stop once . &quot;
a n@@ atives that would not be called , said , &quot; It is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this travel@@ ers only to be spo@@ iled by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and they even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ ds said : &quot; we are aware of an unknown store on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal step , so as fast as possible .
in order to support our sales collection , it is very important that many calls for an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police report by phone 101 .
this is wearing a picture of the situation to create in which the court must check when we present our case . &quot;

in the focus of investig@@ ations , several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to data , Mu@@ eller grew more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
the Washington Post &quot; wrote some weeks ago , that the special investig@@ ator was personally inaugurated in the centre for breaking up , if the President may det@@ ecting the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the aff@@ air .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to prove to exam@@ ine the evidence in possible break@@ down cases and to decide whether it is charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called evidence of evidence .
generally , it is switched on if larger and contro@@ versi@@ al cases .
the procedure always takes place behind locked doors .
the panel is also enabled by the Pro@@ secution by people to det@@ ect individuals .
according to the transmitter CN@@ N , already pre @-@ invit@@ ations issued to turn around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked of a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ or and Sch@@ el@@ der@@ son J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner also took part in the conversation of Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the conversation .
legal experts said on the Thursday night in the US television that the not@@ ion shows that Mu@@ eller is in his work not pro@@ st@@ itute , and that he should be necessary to act as soon as it should be .
but it &apos;s not necess@@ arily called that the Grand Jury will be turned on the end to decide on the collection of an Indi@@ c@@ tment .
nevertheless , the involvement of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in the beginning of a new phase in the study and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new enthusi@@ asts used the President of the Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia , to depic@@ t the Russia aff@@ air as campaign as campaign of his political opp@@ onents .
&quot; Russia @-@ history is a total in@@ vention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .

Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gig@@ antic ice@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ k@@ tis , a gig@@ antic ice@@ berg was replaced by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin@@ s .
the Bre@@ mer@@ h@@ av@@ ener Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday
situated over a trillion t@@ onne of heavy , and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large col@@ oss are going on to the north and will probably be two , three years until he had mel@@ ted .
it is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice huge , researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is a danger for people from him .
in how far the climate change has played a role in the breaking of ice cream , is un@@ clear after research .
for about 30 years , there has been a series of unusual coll@@ um@@ ps in the region , writing the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact .
according to many researchers , that could be united with global warming .
the broken col@@ oss had been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ike until now .
sm@@ ite we@@ aker on the sea and is s@@ alted far from large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
so it grows further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ike is located south of South America nearly at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises was the balance of qu@@ ois and canc@@ el some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ ess@@ s was there where AW@@ I resear@@ cher writes Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot of evidence that the lar@@ sen @-@ C stit@@ ches are in danger , because the front edge have never with@@ drawn from the right hand as at the moment .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate stood below tension and could be broken in case of a key number .
the m@@ elt &apos;s melting and ice@@ berg increases the level of sea level , since they sw@@ im on the water and ice as much water , as it yiel@@ ds right after the melting .
however , the loss of the building fe@@ ises that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can desc@@ end directly to the sea and much faster than before .
this could increase sea level , but only in low dimensions , the British research project for observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Midas ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ br@@ s is the fourth biggest shame of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
the transition from main@@ land is up to 700 metres thick , at the fore@@ front to the free ocean some 200 metres .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural way , and no direct connection to climate change is , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most recent re@@ treat since the start of the records , &quot; he confirmed .
among scientists be contro@@ versi@@ al if the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrate again , or may come together , possibly his colle@@ ague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models tell that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even though this researchers have not lead the cancellation of this gig@@ antic ice cream in the past decade , so far as many ice sk@@ el@@ es of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
this long gyp@@ sum of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends toward South America .
according to data from the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the iron surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula have declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s .
at the decline of the temperature rise , the temperature rise .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula have wa@@ ited around three degrees in the past 50 years and counting the areas where the temperature is at the fastest lap .
CD@@ U wants away from pets at the staff
because it is always difficult to occup@@ y free jobs , requ@@ est@@ ing the CD@@ U to join the emplo@@ yer of the labor in order to be more attractive .
only in front of the summer break , 41 new jobs took place in administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now there are 17 apprenti@@ ces in their first working day .
the teachers present at the circle are obviously very sought .
some 620 applications were to be able to draw up their seats in this year .
non@@ eth@@ eless , however , the circle continued staff to handle the gest@@ ive requirements and tasks .
currently , in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann , just like 50 not occupied spaces .
among others , doctors and engineers and forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U would now also take the initiative to attack the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and on the management of the experts in the management of the U@@ AE .
following the request of the parties &quot; a concept to personal earnings and staff development . &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term conditions to meet professionals , but future @-@ oriented candidates of application .
the overall concept was to view inside and outside , concrete measures for trans@@ itions show and a training offensive , require CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has to do it with staff problems , which could not be known earlier .
other cities wer@@ en good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is by a real &quot; competition of public emplo@@ yer . &quot;
this is a high number of employees , the disease or age due from the service .
maximum time to hand , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , president of the CD@@ U , goes out together with his party beyond the common application .
he made a long time in the cra@@ y@@ day for a fine original surprise , when he set the personal cost of public in question and the remaining parties .
people would like to exam@@ ine that all possibilities will be reviewed by the municipal workers association .
&quot; if we arrive here in short term to a satis@@ factory solution , the round@@ about to the trade unions - maybe even in cooperation with the sum@@ p@@ ent cities - one away from pets , &quot; so people .
this is trying to pay the CD@@ U , employees and officials to pay better than ever the T@@ ari@@ for@@ d@@ gement must actually see the public ministry .
the sal@@ aries are pres@@ ently pres@@ cri@@ bed , refresh@@ ing or more money , only if one changes in a higher level , which is oriented to professional years .
however , the tasks of the circle exist continued over the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees ass@@ essed the provisions of the new pro@@ st@@ itute protection law .
not last by increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele und Kreis@@ ler Martin judge a problem : you have a bit of staff .
Italy merge the tone to NGO @-@ Mig@@ rants Res@@ em@@ bass@@ es
in Italy NGOs send the rescue boats for mig@@ rants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they may not continue to continue to keep new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs send no new record code , it &apos;s hard to see how they can continue to continue , &quot; said Minister Marco Min@@ it@@ i , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ it@@ is warning came one day after the Italian authorities had got a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth b@@ ail@@ et &apos; . because their team had worked in a way that the illegal immig@@ ration had been involved in a way that illegal immig@@ ration .
the aid organisation , which has been in operation only since one year , is addressed to detail from Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry that we can not operate in search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media .
&quot; we can all acc@@ us@@ ations , which are currently collected , after we collected all information and share the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities received the Boat of &apos; Youth Rett@@ et &apos; , monitors the I@@ u@@ venta , monit@@ ored since October .
it is believed that his crew can be delivered by boat mig@@ rants who can carry them directly by human dealers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such a meeting , only 1.3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast took place , according to the ac@@ te of the state , whose content was published by itali@@ an media .
the occupation is susp@@ ected of po@@ inting to the authority of Italian coastal waters to over@@ throw the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not out of any other mot@@ ives .
under the code of co@@ dex , boats must work as the I@@ u@@ venta mostly to board an Italian police officers who monit@@ ored their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs working on search and rescue operations are now ready to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS in Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
last one said on Thursday that the new rules could be un@@ necessary , but acceptable for no &quot; significant changes or dis@@ abilities &quot; would bring their life actions .
among those who refused to sign the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ it@@ i told that the number of mig@@ rants who had declined slightly in Italy , in the last weeks that the efforts to strengthen the strength@@ ening of the Liby@@ an coast and have borne the collaboration with local gar@@ dening fruits .
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the Tun@@ n@@ els , &quot; said the minister .
he gave Plans for further talks with Liby@@ an Citi@@ zen in this month on economic development initi@@ atives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of mig@@ rants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

but it is a proper athl@@ ete ?
for many , the performance is safe re@@ conc@@ iled .
Ingo Fro@@ evil has set a long time with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is compet@@ ent and many biological and physical reactions , which one can find out in classical sport , for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
there is also no cogn@@ itive skills , a techn@@ ological and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction .
professional gamers should not only do not only at the console , but also exercise their bodies and on the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte players is a good player . &quot;
fro@@ sty also sees problems : &quot; d@@ op@@ ing is always a subject . &quot;
controls are difficult to use online games , and in the scene is missing the structures of classical sports .
the scientists set the high @-@ inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are international on the road that is like a major global family since there is no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study of the business consult@@ ancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 we have been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , spon@@ sor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years , sales were expected to grow at 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros in the soccer le@@ ague is little .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; not far away from the other established sports , such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consult@@ ants .
International are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball ho@@ ists Sh@@ aqu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participated in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition provider of Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe does a lot of mind .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as a class , saith fro@@ sty .
in the Netherlands and France , the football first @-@ le@@ ague clubs are ob@@ li@@ ged to establish a e @-@ sport division according to D@@ ut@@ t .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany st@@ inks Germany , &quot; explained V@@ f@@ B Management Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .

Michelle Carter because of the texts , by Conrad Roy doing his su@@ icide , condem@@ ns
a wife of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because they had encour@@ aged their bo@@ y@@ friend by texts and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind G@@ it@@ ans and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was sentenced to death in June for having long death by Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ tr@@ en@@ ly .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free for calling .
she had been con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representative arg@@ um@@ ented that both she had suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .
in red trousers and a cre@@ amy blo@@ use of d@@ ressed , Carter , with te@@ ars kept in the eyes , turned their eyes and to the bottom @-@ ended eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions have been killed by Conrad Roy , &quot; said the State of the State .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has not taken over responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ gre@@ ts . &quot;
but Car@@ ters law@@ yers said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful conf@@ essed that they had completely re@@ gre@@ t@@ ful . &quot;
judge Lawrence Moniz , however , he did not found that her &quot; age or tyre &apos;s bike or even their cl@@ ergy disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
an Prosecutor read a declaration by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lynn Roy who occup@@ ies that there is no day , in which I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son .
I would like to be proud of me and as I am with everything . I try to be able to bear with all my pain , who we will bear for the et@@ ernity with us to be for his sisters , &quot; says it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dyn Roy said that they should be per@@ sec@@ uted by the knowledge &quot; will never be able to participate in the marriage of their brother , or to be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; not to have this only one person who had been together since my birth every day , a pain I will always keep in my life for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
the case seems to set a legal prec@@ ed@@ ity , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it to a crime that require any other committed su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a hydro@@ carbon dioxide po@@ ison@@ ing in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention when Car@@ ters granted text messages that they had encour@@ aged him to end his life .
&quot; hanging up , spring of a building , open yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she told them in several news that they had sent to his death in two weeks before his family .
in the sight of his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad , &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing that you must do , is the generator , and you will be free and be happy . &quot;
judge Moniz said that Carter &apos;s attention was cancelled and ordered by the death of Roy that they will benefit from the case .
the case has the legal ple@@ ases .

Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m from the FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed to run as captain in the Audi Cup , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern settled the Conf@@ ed Cup winner for a large season - Extra motiv@@ ation .
some@@ how there was different at his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra clothes part was very small .
but as far as far and wide the second day of the Audi C@@ ups did not see Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel New , he rose up a touch with the arm .
&quot; the trainer did not announced , &quot; the Conf@@ ed Cup winner was in her first use as a Bavaria @-@ Kapitän from his first use as Bavaria @-@ Kapitän .
well , the one could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach could also suggest .
not the eight year old Art@@ uro V@@ idal was chosen by adol@@ esc@@ ents , deb@@ ug@@ al and just from the holiday , professionals had chosen existing C @-@ El@@ f as the game leaders , but he .
you will be distributed in love with those who want to stand much , who wants to keep in the laugh@@ ter .
so who was trying to join the hei@@ r of L@@ ah@@ m , a small Extra motiv@@ ation can only need only good .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want to take as a player : responsibility &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old is considered a mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m across the field .
on the right back , this is now his position , the white bin@@ ds on the arm opened its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i realized in this starting formation as the one that the ru@@ der can also take the hand to the hand .
he gave instructions to turn the un@@ claimed trou@@ pe .
he had the views of Gan@@ ze , while many others work with himself .
V@@ idal therefore to play his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ ds little ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches pointed out on the devil , and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus to drop in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
this is fol@@ dable quite well .
sweet@@ le was next to K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the bri@@ gade , both ag@@ ated sou@@ th@@ ly .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm often did so hard , in addition , Sü@@ le attemp@@ ted to succe@@ ed in a few times .
his colle@@ ague Rud@@ y was to say that the result was &quot; not such as we hope for us . &quot;
but also he showed a regular performance at his debut .
game leaves , Tem@@ plates : &quot; for this style I was also p@@ icked up . &quot;
like un@@ inhabited , this Bavaria @-@ Welt is still available for the new turn , in connection to the game .
Rud@@ y for example there was not one or two , but surely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich f@@ are@@ well after a few hit statements in the back of his new compet@@ itor .
there he heard an interesting pro@@ position : &quot; what goes right here , I have already noticed now .
at Bayern , you must win any game every game . &quot;
after all , he must bring the New no more .

one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 350@@ ,000 units .
the BMW @-@ Ch@@ air@@ woman said , the company is the mind that &quot; there are intelligent options as a road@@ side , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on diesel vehicles , or in@@ complete .
on Tuesday , Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
one of the company described the companies as a call .
European automobile manufacturers have funded the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States , to support the rules of carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen Ox@@ ides , em@@ it the diesel engines , are considered to cause carot@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and cause ast@@ h@@ ma .
the cost of automotive manufacturer , facilities to re @-@ neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles , can also be re@@ install from diesel vehicles , too , what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars more competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ign@@ ore the powerful auto companies and ign@@ ore the problem of the problem .
the company trying to avoid the use of Volkswagen to prevent the use of so @-@ called shooting devices that could be tested if a car has been tested but with normal drive conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
in the past month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the motor@@ ways of Audi in Germany .
former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected against ex@@ tradition and could be ordered in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investig@@ ations in Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused of having system@@ atically focused on the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States .
the incl@@ usion of Audi in the study could be heavy loads : the luxury car manufacturers contri@@ butes to dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately at the winning of Volkswagen .

lav@@ ender in Provence , threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to illness of d@@ rought and due to illness transferred on in@@ se@@ cts , scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , great he@@ ada@@ ches .
Eric Ch@@ a@@ isse , expert of the agricultural institute of the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effective immediately , because the plant had been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has had much less rain in the spring of much more .
this imp@@ acts imp@@ acts on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that carries the Zwer@@ g@@ z@@ ik@@ es , and in very dry conditions , there are many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil lu@@ red not only for vacation , it is also popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Ch@@ a@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long vegetable oh@@ ren with a large number of flowers , we have minor , under@@ developed and either missing or missing .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
for solutions that are considered to be considered , include a better water distribution and slow@@ down of vap@@ our from the ground , but also the exam@@ ine of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .

the assass@@ ination of an journalists under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce meet on Wedn@@ esdays in order to exam@@ ine their plans for reporting on the youngest ch@@ aos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a , organised by the organized crime , cor@@ rupt civil servants and un@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own trag@@ edy , they came together to talk about security .
it was given to them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what saf@@ er fe@@ els : they should take their children with the office that were the goal of a attack with gren@@ ade , or at home .
security experts have three words on a panel on the front of the space : opp@@ onents , neutral , ally and ally .
you ask the rep@@ orter who suggest@@ s name for every column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions and ab@@ dom@@ inal fe@@ el@@ ings .
there are thre@@ ats , polit@@ icians , busin@@ ess@@ men , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are susp@@ ected from the government of the government or the map , a catalog of cri@@ min@@ als that make the ch@@ aos of Mexico .
there is no glory of violence , and throughout the country the bodies are frequent , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since the president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took part in December 2012 . 589 , after attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter , their publ@@ ishers and their in@@ spir@@ ators of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest issue is to live in Mexico to be living in Mexico , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
his lack is recommended , although his presence is available - a large picture of Val@@ dez , that shows his middle @-@ finger on the front of the Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce building . two rep@@ orter in the three years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear T @-@ Shirts , who will show his face of face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orter discuss its divided topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a special German Federal Government was built to ass@@ ert the cases of journalists , according to the committee of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murder , each year with thre@@ ats and organized crime are linked , the mur@@ derer von journalists will only be rare before the court .
in Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce they still stand to treat violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ apped and even though the Ter@@ rain is still missing .
no information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , has the meeting for the discussion of security little benefits , I@@ bar@@ ra says .
&quot; it is very st@@ up@@ id , doing my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we know not the why we know all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce in the country &apos;s capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a couple of blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men . he was shot from his car and was shot at him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which was translated into the &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the cap continued in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours was added to Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practi@@ cally nothing in silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans was arrested in the last year and ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Zin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the blo@@ ody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ent fr@@ actions come here to fill the vacuum .
it &apos;s nothing that can be shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day or more people on the streets , or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of t@@ inn@@ ed , two @-@ storey maus@@ ol@@ een for thre@@ ats who are larger than many homes for the living .
for@@ got a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranqu@@ ility &quot; if only a card control of the coastal city with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , with gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
initially , in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a ri@@ val@@ ed cart@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans children .
this publication may have denied the sons , susp@@ ected gear@@ ing bought each copy of the output as soon as they delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake was in it , Val@@ dez not to z@@ win@@ gen , after the compl@@ aints of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a land@@ mark in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived , that his friends and colleagues , that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as a experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce in 2003 and sold 50 US dollars of shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without po@@ ison on the smoking case , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time , the newspaper served a rep@@ utation for the encour@@ age and hon@@ est coverage , and revenue and advertising revenue .
rep@@ orter loved it , hard tre@@ ating investig@@ ations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the reader were fascinating , in which they could read stories that nobody couldn &apos;t handle anything else .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot prize for its coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the commit@@ tees to the protection of journalists for its cour@@ age in the pro@@ secution of the Mexican drug history , where they ever gone .
he gave himself up to that he fe@@ ared .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
drug market in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in the past October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; you must take the task to take you as a journalist - either it or you play the Dum@@ bbells .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do for so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what went ? &quot;
the Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ wn@@ y , who could curse to the friend , who was gener@@ ously with U@@ mar@@ ies and counsel , a teacher who knew how to survived .
they tru@@ sted on his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always sit to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , going on the same table there .
now they ask : was his love for routine ?
his death also has forced to declare their own providers on the question how they can do their work on the best , and remain in life .
&quot; you don &apos;t like to move up with their wives , their children , their own shops , their own grid and run@@ ways , to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ st@@ aging and self @-@ locking .
his own inst@@ inc@@ ing trust .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , ab@@ b away .
the trouble is , said the Editor of the Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; Sm@@ ell can be a mind that can be done ... and then the thing happened with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and other say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ p@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ uten , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt government services .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff members of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly there were no cell phones . days before , Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activ@@ ists in Mexico .
in the shade of a tree made of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the jo@@ ke , some of the rep@@ orter who belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who had instruc@@ ted even as a tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it has been here , since the rep@@ orter went into the mountain landscape where the drug group fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce has appeared on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the former known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Ch@@ av@@ ez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to state spending that focused on the h@@ omet@@ own of the Govern@@ ors of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of state , a kid@@ n@@ apping .
there was no official word about it , who was kid@@ n@@ apped or as it was happened to write what everyone in the city knows that all of each in the city knows that the restaurant has a favourite place of drug merch@@ ants and authorities .
a rep@@ orter of public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who had instruc@@ ted the govern@@ ed Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled out all the 19th century .
several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused because of high @-@ cardi@@ ac cases of cor@@ ruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the rep@@ orter of rep@@ orter of previous incid@@ ents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers voted the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source on the kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; earlier , we had already know what happened , &quot; says Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his sli@@ m body .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office , dedicated to a storage room for signs and sticker , dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the staff have become something that they had never expected : activ@@ ists in the name of the press .
rep@@ orter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ app@@ te a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration of an additional journalists to the Office of State Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the Western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is .
by the whole country , journalists turned stronger by creating them in organized prot@@ ests &quot; SOS Press &quot; in obe@@ di@@ ments and construc@@ ts .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez travels to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities , journalist and ren@@ ew journalists because they have said the truth .
it has since has been asked since that by the government once again , because it is concerned that her W@@ ut has injured their obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crime , participated in the government officials and a equal society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orter could not only be killed by thre@@ ats , but also on orders of politics and security forces , who used with the organized crime of a blank@@ et .
the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; received more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants last year .
&quot; in Mexico , knowing that you want to hold the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously the mor@@ al have a terri@@ ble effect .
nobody got the death of the b@@ logger Mary Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ p@@ as in front of six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was supp@@ os@@ edly signed by Z@@ etas sam@@ ell : &quot; here I am with my reports . &quot;
in addition to their separate head , a computer keyboard and headphones .
some branches have chosen to concl@@ ude like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , following the assass@@ ination of Cor@@ respon@@ l@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others do well , like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assass@@ ination of their directors in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly announced the drug files with an edit@@ orial articles on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries , or even from the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and observe the streets and search for d@@ ang@@ ers .
and sometimes they will follow , as evi@@ d@@ ently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa who was assass@@ inated in 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico City three months following the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risks decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , is that the drug retail was shot at him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was rep@@ orter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the ed@@ itors of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce began on the office and drank beer , when all their phones started to Sum@@ men .
a series of shooting paintings with Band@@ en@@ ri@@ val@@ en and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan had 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell Emb@@ as@@ si@@ es in the region .
from the border stone , they have published the news on the Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce website via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
sir@@ ens bo@@ iled near - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who thought to see if they were in read@@ iness .
when they were afraid , they did not show them .
among the mighty portrait of the fallen founding of the newspaper , whose Middle@@ finger for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a was visible , followed by Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce his traces .
&quot; how can you think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when at the same day , at the same day , intern@@ ship was murdered by Javier , the intern@@ ship will be asked to send them to the road . &quot;
Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used cam@@ ouflage to so@@ ak his enemies
it looks like a statue that looks like a statue , like a statue , like a statue .
now researchers have found that the first in@@ sights of an amazing min@@ ers of a Canadian min@@ ers so well received that experts were described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
it was so good that it could even be found that his el@@ derly skin of red@@ dish brown was - and they said they would have something from a &quot; Un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report published in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; called him as &quot; the ret@@ ained arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s copies of the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossil is a newly discovered type of N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s that lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably well preserved condition , researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; to describe .
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ oured plant will be the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that was fl@@ aked off the surrounding cli@@ ffs , decided to look more detail from the surrounding cli@@ ffs .
founded by him F@@ ossil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ä@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years , the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.100 kg ) .
after all these hard work , the ready result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you have a little with the eyes blind , you could almost believe that it sle@@ pt , &quot; said the main poet Cal@@ eb Brown , sci@@ entist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is seen .
&quot; it will come to the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ held din@@ os@@ aur@@ s spec@@ im@@ ens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ au@@ riere . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant f@@ ress@@ er , although it is covered with a divi@@ der and res@@ em@@ bles the bre@@ em@@ bles , probably from meat dum@@ per din@@ os@@ aur .
the strong arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves before cra@@ b , and used an screen@@ ings , which is used as a counter , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix well into its environment and to so@@ ak his enemies , experts , what indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s has made head@@ lines and is now shown in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology in May .
researchers have now studying the wild animal and it &apos;s Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ets@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ ste@@ ek@@ ee@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours .
the amazing con@@ servation of the specimen allowed it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , which document the design and the form of she@@ ds and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the tap@@ ered sh@@ aded , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the peak of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker was as their under@@ side .
although the console is common , the results will be sur@@ pris@@ ingly , because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has exceeded the living animals today .
it suggest@@ s that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s caused by enough pressure by meat to din@@ os@@ aur@@ s that evolution of evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation as an average of survival .
but most of contemporary animals allowed to use the tap@@ ered sh@@ aded - are much smaller and viol@@ ated as pre@@ y , what signals that this N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s had been exposed to a real struggle .
&quot; strong car@@ rot behavior on a massive , strong arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s pre@@ dat@@ ors have been to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ al ra@@ vel brown was .
scientists continue to exam@@ ine the animal on crit@@ ics on its life , including his conservative loans to find out what it has eaten than its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur , when he died , was driven out into a river and cast into the sea where he decreased on the back to the sea .
at this time , Alber@@ ta was so warm like South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans are probably widespread land@@ ward as they are today .
&quot; this N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s is really remarkable , because he is covered completely with the conservative @-@ less skin , but also in three dimensions remains , and the original shape of the animal is be@@ holding , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the Tier today looks almost the same as in the early delivery period .
they don &apos;t need much imag@@ ination to re@@ construc@@ t it . if you are just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
the delivery time was a time when huge thermal o@@ des , fl@@ esh@@ ly mon@@ os@@ aur@@ al , which arose on two legs , the earth is gone through .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ os@@ aur@@ us Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s were arrested by some of his f@@ urch@@ war@@ ding ancest@@ ors .
this one is one of the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ aur@@ us , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy duty .
the researchers , their latest in@@ sights in the journal Current Biology revealed that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was transferred to the death in the sea and dis@@ band@@ ed in the mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum it is the be@@ ast preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s in the world , including skin and tur@@ key , and is complete from the sn@@ out to the hip .
the cre@@ atures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it included two 20 @-@ inch long tips that rag@@ ged by its sh@@ oul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant f@@ ress@@ er was kin@@ dled by the Western Canada , until a flo@@ oded river it flo@@ wed into the open sea .
but the under@@ water type of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ al re@@ war@@ med his arms in exquis@@ ite detail .
the st@@ on@@ ew@@ ed remains of this special , so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste still cover the pri@@ cing plates along the din@@ os@@ aur@@ al
like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic , is such a level of con@@ servation so &apos; rarely like a profit in the l@@ otto .
the more I see it , the better ren@@ der it becomes .
st@@ on@@ ew@@ ed resi@@ dual of the skin still cover the hol@@ pri@@ cel@@ ess plates that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
his right foot is laid on its side , his five fing@@ ers are bent to the top .
I can count the she@@ ds on his sole . &apos;

a great sur@@ vey@@ ed to rescue service was on the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in direction Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long return station was formed .
like a AZ @-@ rep@@ orter , there came also on the back@@ slide for a massive dis@@ abilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade not@@ ched the license number of the vehicle direc@@ ting , which now have to count with sensitive pen@@ al@@ ties .
just after 18 : 45 it was still a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ ia and a passenger car .
a b@@ ail@@ er helicop@@ ter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that has experienced almost everyone once : nothing dou@@ bly s@@ itt@@ eth in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work , and has just a brilliant thoughts .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner , and we@@ ds an uns@@ ets , or wal@@ k@@ eth the rest in the middle of the work@@ flow .
monitoring control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are coming soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently test the main attrac@@ t@@ less guide services .
you simply confirms the mobile phone that one should be taken and remov@@ es the ticket .
at present , a test run on two routes .
&quot; the offer is coming , wide we offer .
it is expected to be available in the beginning of next year on many other long distance routes in Germany , &quot; said one way .
&quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called the train card overall with Schaff@@ ner .
to use it , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a Smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what you do already have to do most passengers .
it is also necessary to have the app the DB Navigator , what kind of it is the eas@@ iest way of the box .
and last one needs a seating reserv@@ ing .
the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works so : it moves up into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My tickets &quot; .
a button for electronic valid@@ ation appears in the test customers .
the access to their mobile devices are a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and has taken the dr@@ ug@@ ging seat place Y .
comes the train conductor on number Y white he knows that there is a passenger with previously prepared online ticket .
so you can continue to continue , continue to keep silence .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for rail - which is to take advantage of passengers .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t want to travel without a ticket control via our train ticket , check out in the DB navig@@ ator .
this enables the passengers to create their travel time in the train personal trip , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing director of DB correspondence .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer requirements . &quot;
those who are often travels , knows that besides del@@ ays and missed trains , the map controls one of the biggest doctors .
for often , one of the passengers should not take all documents in any case , but you will need to obtain online tickets online .
either the credit card or the number of personnel is missing or else a document that must be presented .
the result are endless discussions between train and rides , which leads to worse mood in the part or large room and del@@ ays at the end of its own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner takes over the time to take care of others .
nor can only use a small number of test customers the new service .
and that is also on the connections of the ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same way are not un@@ locked .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
in August 9 , 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shot up to her core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis pra@@ ises on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b @-@ flat which they rent and sc@@ roll@@ ers through Facebook to their phone .
they stum@@ ble over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; it was named there .
conf@@ used by no one else she had posted the information on her Fe@@ ed , she finished Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly offering at their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the street and remain there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell car@@ ed for himself .
but it was death for her and her fel@@ lowship .
she turned their mobile phone to return on the evening to Twe@@ et over people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos of the police tape and people who cried out , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live fe@@ ed , with which a polic@@ eman was in front of a group of protest@@ ers with a bell@@ ine dog .
in another video , she said , was a different polic@@ eman and cried , saying , &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; I remember@@ ed her statement .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ om@@ ed ourselves and we can call it typically . &quot;
at that moment , I felt Schütt@@ el@@ frost .
I was mad and wept . &quot;
you booked a trip , went home next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided to drive the two next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary movie &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ em@@ as from the 11 .
it is a story of survi@@ ving and of protest , the strength and power of resistance , which consists of the point of people living in the community and the streets were filled to demand answers .
as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a vase @-@ dress and a right crown carried out after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , discuss the two of a conversation which they had count@@ less times in this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember , how I have taught you when black people must go for war , what they believe ? &quot; remember@@ ed that which she said .
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and it wasn &apos;t really true .
I couldn &apos;t take them away , &quot; he said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
they must know it and see it on it .
it must be well designed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free for ourselves .
even though I was lucky enough to give you an experience with which they do not have any ective rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
I &apos;ve got the feeling I would have a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
the first station , when she arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was granted to a camp on the possible non @-@ acc@@ us@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there were Fer@@ rell and her daughter with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and made them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly started a new type of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell &apos;s appearance .
&quot; my stock vis@@ m has changed after 9 August total , &quot; she said , &quot; she said that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Russian Student N@@ urses Association and focused on food justice and health prec@@ ed@@ oms in black con@@ greg@@ ations .
&quot; I had no experience in organiz@@ ing .
it has come here . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during a evening demonstration in Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , a co @-@ directors of the film .
follow @-@ up , she said , her cam@@ eram@@ an Lucas Alvar@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted , &quot; what happened .
a question came from Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; will you be documented or trying to find a story that you can ut@@ ili@@ ze it ? &quot;
this Sk@@ ep@@ sis was nour@@ ished by count@@ less cases of people , often from wil@@ lows - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated on an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices have not cent@@ ered and we wanted to do it differ@@ ently . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an already worked with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that rum also known for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m by To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ct .
his commitment , Fer@@ rell brought the project closer together with six other deposits followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years to Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not anyone who speaks for us , or talking about us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; that was the main thing for me as those people are depic@@ ted , because I will be represented . &quot;
the target was not to focus on fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not a Messi@@ as guide , but for a community that come together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be revealed as the manif@@ est participant in the film .
as a consequ@@ ence , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly , personal aspects of fer@@ rel@@ ls live , as she loves and married her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; I said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I agree that it must have a certain inj@@ ury in this work with the de@@ hum@@ ane of black people . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls story repeated the role of the black sw@@ imm@@ ers women in the bro@@ ader black @-@ liv@@ es @-@ mat@@ ter motion .
two of the three fo@@ unders of movement , who discovered the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identify the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as a weak .
&quot; black , weak women in leadership positions have borne the movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we are fighting in different fron@@ ts .
black , weak women must bear the main last of everything . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an voted to note that &quot; the movement of the black women and many black women are kept growing . &quot;
however , it is however , that &quot; this is no aff@@ ir@@ ative type of action , &quot; at the Fer@@ rell &apos;s identity as the heart of the film was selected .
&quot; she was the person who raised this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , although she was in front of the front man because of a life at these cru@@ is@@ ations as a black , a weak woman so much on the game .
you can feel your energy by the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the rac@@ ite links between the congregation and the police continue .
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years due to blocking the highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social @-@ magical atmosphere of the area that they call her home : &quot; a ch@@ aos . &quot;
non@@ eth@@ eless they were cl@@ am@@ bled at a voc@@ al and she fe@@ els like this mem@@ orial , since then she went over three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the street .
&quot; it is our oblig@@ ation to fight for our freedom .
it is our oblig@@ ation to win .
we must love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
coming from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ Reader discuss through bit @-@ gallery
the Bit Gallery moved people , although they are still not built for long .
but the idea of a shopping center at the southern part of the pe@@ de@@ strian zone has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first presentation in 2009 the population in Be@@ ars and opp@@ onents .
cold lets the topic hardly any one .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while one of the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , coming from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi &#93; ) or quite a light : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while it fe@@ ared to build a gallery more clients across the city , of which the other stores are benef@@ iting , fear the opponent &apos;s pe@@ de@@ strian zone .
in addition , the gallery is planned in exactly on the property , in which the farm@@ houses will offer their products in the 13 direct mark@@ ings .
at the beginning of the construction , it will be completed .
the Galerie Ma@@ cher want to integ@@ rate a market place in the new building , and to the Bed@@ a square with a possibility to sit outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been at a time in the farmhouse market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the country are always very pleased .
we also discovered the but@@ chers for us .
we would like to wish us , even during and especially after construction of the gallery there is a chance to get up this offer .
there is also that in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct mark@@ ers at a market hall in the gallery , comes on the height of rent .
the same is probably not low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what is the shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
whether Cl@@ othing , shoes , Dro@@ ma@@ - or super@@ markets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many charges are empty here - some have been working here for months and years .
but there &apos;s not a regular weekly market , it is more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle remains at least .
because after all the service of the service is fresh , mostly the product of the product is offered directly from the product , and is o@@ ben@@ ded in in@@ expensive .
as you can see , shop bo@@ okl@@ ets are hi@@ red in a shopping centre only of larger companies because the dor@@ ms are often not portable for one retailers .
shame , special stores there are almost no more and that which is still left , will probably be van@@ ish . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together .
and the Gallery is not according to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the pe@@ as@@ ant mark@@ thalle during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in duration if the bit of bit is actually actually comes .
or creates it to be the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit Gallery in advance , all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just will not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs .
after my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer market place , it is no longer thanks to the aw@@ esome game , like I find - sen@@ sel@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the farmhouse is broken , a piece of culture will dis@@ appear again . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ ar@@ ity : artist creates port@@ raits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost impossible to im@@ pose them on the ceiling of the ceiling .
the 30 port@@ raits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ tubes and hair@@ style , which were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the ex@@ cer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ tics had a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she made public diplom@@ atic messages about the Vik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate simil@@ ar@@ ity ) .
she is the product of two years Cor@@ respon@@ dence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipl@@ ine is their professional compet@@ ence in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a wife and dis@@ si@@ det@@ ent dis@@ sid@@ ine , whose assessment of Barack Obama was converted , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which was extrac@@ ted from the 30 port@@ raits , such as any intel@@ lec@@ tual property , not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many wise men , and the toug@@ h@@ est det@@ eri@@ oration of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also created to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward born in 2013 , but has been sentenced to 20 charges since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , including six viol@@ ations against the Sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer was and the@@ ft .
through the prison was her picture , so much that there was only a single photograph - a gra@@ iny color , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is clearly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and an plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde is spe@@ ars - associated with it was also associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of their 2012 project &quot; St@@ ran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist port@@ raits of fore@@ ign@@ ers from for@@ en@@ ical art@@ e@@ facts like cigarette ligh@@ ten@@ ds and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum that extrac@@ ted the DNA from the waste , to produce a picture of which people may look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in jail , and they wanted to ac@@ company a kind of portrait to ac@@ company that article , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg declared a press preview for the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t visit at this time and could not be photograph@@ ed , therefore , you took contact with Chelsea , and asked them if they wanted a DNA portrait .
in the course of two years , the artist and their in@@ ad@@ missions were killed , who inter@@ v@@ ex@@ ed several letters in the course of two years .
they even had a copy of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed images &quot; who would loc@@ ate a future in which the President Chel@@ seas sentence would be to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama has actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings release after seven brut@@ al years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of lucky gathering .
there are also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep , and Star@@ kes , da Donald Tr@@ ump leads an war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to raise new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to move forward , further to fl@@ aming .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of contemporary artistic statements , cre@@ ing with her sur@@ plus description of them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family names ) is an end of the &quot; automatic crash , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of C@@ s and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg tru@@ sted , through the incl@@ usion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amazing similar to at least in biological sight , we all are .
&quot; what people are hop@@ efully to take care for our gen@@ ome that we are , and how open @-@ genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ j@@ ective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a own room , is one side from the above mentioned com@@ ic Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as it came up with a free pre@@ diction in the hand from the discipl@@ inary Cau@@ cas@@ ins of the United States as King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; if they set up your speech , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so will never be the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et from Philadelphia .
&quot; I still get a ge@@ ese , if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition not personally - as it was supposed to be taken in the com@@ ic book - but when they should do it , then it will be gre@@ eted in the middle of the room of mas@@ ks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulations , that are related to hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
this was also targeted as everything is written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , &quot; Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ast@@ rolog@@ y was written with pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a man &apos;s crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the port@@ raits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel it like a mass movement , which was formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . &quot;
professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nation@@ wide human @-@ hunt is located in the G@@ ange for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford that had been considered a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly inju@@ ries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , based on the alleged involvement of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several engra@@ v@@ ings .
a commun@@ al warning system had been announced by the police authority in Chicago , which was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several inju@@ ries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was found dead at the site of the events for dead , and Det@@ ectives exam@@ ine the engra@@ v@@ ings of murder while police have actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President of the University of University , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that L@@ ath@@ em had been in be@@ ur@@ bed and cle@@ ared out of the camp@@ us of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal issue that was investigated by the compet@@ ent authorities , and the North@@ western University is co@@ operated in this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage .
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a speaker of the University and Som@@ erv@@ ille College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are willing to help us to help us the US investig@@ ational authorities . &quot;
the testimony added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to set him .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demanded the susp@@ ects listed to the authorities .
&quot; the police have a presentation of their stay , and our efforts to loc@@ ate them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said the police received a call of the building administ@@ rator of the Grand @-@ Plaza &quot; building , who had just received a r@@ uly tip that has happened in apartment 1008 .
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear if the incid@@ ent took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security agents that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the vic@@ tim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement on the residents : &quot; the police is working at the time axis and the background of mot@@ ifs , including a possible h@@ äus@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long time until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ op@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the recovery of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ op@@ ing agency ( RU@@ SA@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of determination of the schedule , RU@@ SA@@ DA has the right to plan to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
the WA@@ DA schedule has been updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM comm@@ ented the second part of the schedule of the WA@@ DA to compliance with the code that describes the criteria for the recovery of RU@@ SA@@ DA , recently published on the website of the organisation .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain what for Russia could cause to defeat in Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; added he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing authorities approved the reported outcome of the WA@@ DA for an investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged off@@ al d@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sports .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation , because our anti @-@ d@@ op@@ ing system has been an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not give something that does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales place R@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov received problems of the past in Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeated that the report was contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report on un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov .
RU@@ SA@@ DA was excluded from the d@@ op@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als from the d@@ op@@ ing control in Russia in November 2015 .
however , it was permitted to use tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the Organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli announced that RU@@ SA@@ DA refers to &quot; in the right direction &quot; moves to be used again .

&quot; the State of public opinion has captured the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or in@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience expensive consequences due to consumers @-@ bo@@ yc@@ ott , worker @-@ flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ation and h@@ agen , said Quin@@ ain .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , converting to more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures , and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if a employees wanted to report a problem , he needed , or she had to find a number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal compl@@ aint and hope that he was har@@ vest@@ ed .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ able and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ son General Coun@@ sel , said that there was no good way to watch the compl@@ aints of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ ters , you can cause problems who were hidden from leadership of leaders that were hidden in offices in cities or States , have been hidden - as dis@@ cri@@ mination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ t@@ ful intern@@ ships .

Glit@@ tering won $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly sur@@ prising because of the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .

the NCAA elim@@ ines the two @-@ day pract@@ ition@@ ers and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
it is at 23 o &apos;clock , as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA Foot@@ ball@@ ots on one side of the new practice fields on camp@@ us .
some have gone out their Tri@@ k@@ oto@@ bu@@ s and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the workout .
for a good part of the team provide a lunch break for a good part of the team .
players who are in@@ scri@@ bed to the summer events , will return to their closing statements before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is a real tre@@ k mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was closed on Tuesday .
the NCAA division comprises two @-@ day exercises to facil@@ itate the load of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three train@@ ings of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to become the full @-@ packed time plans .
the com@@ promise away from the two days is more than a day when breaking the breaking of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times in West wood .
they are supposed to be 18 exercises during the course of August 18 . 20 before the form@@ ations of the game preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he is the subject of the conference , even if they continue the bus@@ y routes of the player another point .
&quot; we put these enormous burden for three or four days , and it &apos;s very challeng@@ ing , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they just pressed , they pl@@ ushes up , they are great people .
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its intern@@ s , as soon as the camp ended , what is being held in view of the clear sigh@@ tings of its fields of an adjacent parking and adjacent Lus@@ ese Center , a hotel of elev@@ ated class that was already existing with floors , which will have a protective net after a gate set , no easy to be completed .
Bru@@ ins players are to occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ ati@@ es that there may be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far away to think that the people would rent there a room and then go there to draw an exercise .
if you have the video from an exercise , it is a quite good job .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I don &apos;t make me too big wor@@ ries .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook seek@@ s to review facts in the fight against counter@@ feit news
Facebook will send more potential articles with fal@@ s@@ ations of the third party and their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight the f@@ ake News .
the company said in a statement on its website , that it will begin with the use of actu@@ ated learning methods to recogn@@ ise possible counter@@ parts and send them to fact that may be displayed by the fact test results from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believed that they are also influ@@ enced US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also affected in Europe on a major political issue , whereby the French vot@@ ers were over@@ flo@@ oded with false stories , and Germany supports a plan , according to the social media networks , if it does not succe@@ ed to elim@@ inate over@@ water post@@ ings just as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told a separate statement on Thursday that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of new facts review .
in addition to the knowledge that stories from Fak@@ ten@@ über@@ ving third parties , people want to read more context to read well @-@ related decisions concerning what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product man@@ ag@@ ress for Facebook news in a blog .
in case you added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; in conjunction with Article &quot; and on other changes to his News Fe@@ ed , to reduce false news .
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was a sli@@ der hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ er .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his hom@@ ely seat in the Cl@@ l River valley in Kent , and is now to in@@ spiration for a graph@@ ical novel of Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ oph@@ a@@ ar@@ igen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a fore@@ love for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look forward to the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he we@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sc@@ anned the time from the Middle A@@ ges to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ w@@ ic@@ z , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Palmer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s TE@@ E@@ TH and Other Stories , &quot; a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expected emot@@ ional .
&quot; I just responded to the Dau@@ ghter print on the page of a letter , which was written by a double ag@@ ent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his th@@ um@@ b pressure !
and letters called upon smoke , because then there was a fire in the light of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the sm@@ ell has a effect when he himself did .
ah , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and almost four months in a castle lived ( &quot; To be hon@@ est@@ ly , I seem to be a little over , &quot; ) seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days that the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ an &quot; new &quot; ch@@ ateau to study the archives and the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ary hypo@@ cr@@ ates of walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the Gr@@ aben .
he emig@@ rated by the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ scapes , gar@@ den@@ ies , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then he drank of &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the in@@ timate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only received full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
as a Rho@@ des a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive began to take care of the archive that he was &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ot@@ Democrats , &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , which represent : &quot; it could be bor@@ ing that land conflic@@ ts could be bor@@ ing , &quot; says r@@ ho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to meet the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his ais@@ le ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection will use the castle as a starting point to spread on a wider basis into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves the newly built castle to join the pe@@ as@@ ant of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording of an u@@ pro@@ ar which appeared in 1380 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says r@@ ho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ as@@ ant began in this area and I thought , a u@@ prising was a good start .
perhaps are the two connected ? &quot;
other stories are conf@@ isc@@ ated in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which is the story of the Jes@@ u@@ it &apos;s history , representing the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , shown in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell car@@ ved out of the 18th century , who filled his own burial site by adding a Sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery which was only done until the year later when his Sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen to be cour@@ ing G@@ aun@@ er , always make deb@@ ts and money for things that they cannot aff@@ ord themselves .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men st@@ ains their debt crisis by pressing a rich old women in marriage - I set it to me as a bunch of a good looking young guys , with a tal@@ ent to get land@@ marks . &quot;
after the end of its service in the castle Rho@@ des on the search for other unique cry experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish game for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ han@@ än@@ mon@@ ki , the area of a San@@ at@@ ori@@ ums from the early 20th century , which has once again returned from nature .
but Scot@@ ney got him a special place .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; says he .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to be ready again with the dam@@ n life . &quot;
campaign launched : about 300 years old Mari@@ ub@@ elle in R@@ hö@@ n@@ dorf cover
with the closure of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old daughter in R@@ hö@@ n@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched her campaign to launch a new roof stamp ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
still until Thursday , may@@ or Otto NEW HO@@ FF and his marketing team will keep the logo and hold the s@@ log@@ an home .
at the end of August it aims to give a celebration of a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of Action has been on the posters at the R@@ hö@@ n@@ dorfer Chapel in yesterday .
&quot; we do not think ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on their un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that some better is better than it seems .
in the bas@@ ically we are the solid conv@@ inc@@ ing that we know as a bathroom hon@@ orary citizens around the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
the action go for more than &quot; only &quot; a logo and a s@@ log@@ an , meaning it .
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a remarkable promise , one that the city is a distinc@@ tive non @-@ distinc@@ tive represent@@ ations . &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other municip@@ alities .
a middle of five @-@ digit amount allows the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f their new roof brand and the campaign will cost .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s Fe@@ ar of the Army
every year it was advis@@ able to Ankara &apos;s Ober@@ ste Military Council ( Y@@ as ) over Pen@@ sion@@ ations and promot@@ ions in officer .
this week too .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine at the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session was not held in the General Staff Building , as early as earlier , but in the Office of the Prime Minister .
on the consult@@ ations under the head of the government , the five vice @-@ regist@@ ers as well as the Minister of Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
these were the civilians in Y@@ as in the city .
the government moves in the military to the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the commander of the army , the Air Force , and the nav@@ y were abol@@ ished .
since the failed Cou@@ p , the general manager of the Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Admir@@ als were fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually because of alleged connections to the Ex@@ il @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an sees the coup d .
against 486 people who have been involved in the coup attempt to have been involved in Ankara since this week .
on the day after the coup had called Erd@@ og@@ an attempt to over@@ throw the ma@@ stur@@ geon , as he gave him the opportunity to make the armed forces &quot; completely clean . &quot;
but did Erd@@ og@@ an really really in the handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ bal@@ ances in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the General Staff of the Chief of &quot; Islam@@ ists &quot; of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ists &quot; of the Army , who manif@@ ested in among others , in the raising of the scal@@ ability for solo manif@@ est@@ ers , wrote the newspaper .
the major gu@@ ards in the army and security forces go further .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an sent a further 73@@ 95 Staats@@ di@@ ener , including 23@@ 03 police officers and 546 soldiers .
it seemed to be nar@@ row@@ ed as the Erd@@ og@@ an in the Military .
the gener@@ als paid earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three . p@@ utsch@@ es them under appeal to their role as gu@@ ards of the world leaders .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an moved the power to power to step by step , not in appeal to the reform of the European Union .

in the &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; war@@ ned a promin@@ ent officer who , after the coup attempt by per@@ secution from abroad , seeking the Turkish army in a few years , &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
after that , this development could not leave the N@@ ato that is not cold .

Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immig@@ ration Plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he looks forward to reduce the legal immig@@ rants to reduce 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter provisions for the term of visa for temporary employees and limit@@ ations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the president .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increasing wages and billi@@ ons of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by using the United States to be issued like the citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new applic@@ ant procedure will come to the candidate of the candidates to support the financial resources to support itself and knowledge that our economy will come to support , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry of the Ministry of Friend@@ ship shuttle
again , over the past few months about the future of the racing team had been fought - now it shall be very fast .
even before the end of the year , the mar@@ o@@ des route is to be built on the tourist tram .
in order to secure the future of the race transportation in the long term , according to the authority of the Ministry of Transport at this year of construction work .
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ er@@ g on the decision to order the country for the tourism important connection , &quot; declared traffic state Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the over@@ hau@@ l of the track be@@ ats it to about 2.5 million euros .
this sum will take 75 percent over the country .
the contract , whose basis the shuttle can also be ordered in the country by the country , I will definitely be mat@@ ched to S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry of the Southern Switzerland as the oper@@ ators are already one of the technical details .
&quot; thus , the road@@ map , which are used on vehicles and quality standards , said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this meant that the race @-@ gate Shuttle will be announced on December 2017 .
the race @-@ firm Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ er@@ g .
in the past few months , the distance of enough many people were used in the course of a pilot production , to order them again in the future .
the route is also strong in parts in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of sex @-@ rob@@ ots is real , and we should wor@@ ry about us
just as you thought it will not be crazy about that 2017 , a new report on the techn@@ ological developments in the range of sex @-@ rob@@ ots .
Yes , indeed .
sex @-@ Robot are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex @-@ rob@@ ots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus of the Robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascent .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , select its form of breast milk and type of fing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
&quot; the people imagine a funny , but the company deliver any amount of it , and we will have much more common to see , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key at the release of his new report .
modern sexu@@ pu@@ ppen have developed from their inflatable partners to rob@@ ots with a silicone gel that can be warm , with consci@@ ous human reactions , which will be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also fit its rob@@ ots in accordance with its convic@@ tions , &quot; and you can choose from the eye of the robot on the form of breast arms up to the type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ s .
but it is still troubled when many rob@@ ots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would have a g@@ az@@ ford @-@ wife progressive appearance .
modern sexu@@ pu@@ ppen have developed into rob@@ ots with a silicone ret@@ ina .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix @-@ Robot allows for example to adjust its users to adap@@ t their robot to the properties like for example so@@ ber .
and then there is still the Ro@@ of True Comp@@ an@@ ion developed by True Comp@@ an@@ ion &apos;s sex @-@ rob@@ ots with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; with the impression of so@@ ber attacks and &quot; wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; ab@@ ad@@ vent@@ u@@ rous &quot; person@@ ality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a person@@ ality that is adapted to your person@@ ality as good as possible , &quot; sw@@ are the site of True Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so you like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
it has also in the course of day , you also have their voices - quite as real people !
you can be ti@@ red to be fixed on con@@ vers@@ ational , or it can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many troubled aspects on this asc@@ en@@ sion of sex @-@ rob@@ bers - not least because they re@@ placing human relation@@ ships - but the sub@@ ordin@@ arily female properties that is appe@@ aring on fri@@ gi@@ d ( the name here : contra@@ sting ) Far@@ rah is added , un@@ ser@@ ene a most .
on his website , True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , but for males .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , why can men do not have any Ro@@ of ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex @-@ rob@@ ots are not only a fet@@ ish or just another sex play .
their emer@@ gence and their increasing Raff@@ in@@ esse show some dar@@ ker and lo@@ wering of our culture , on a return of the ideal of equality of sex@@ es to a desire to sex with sub@@ mission as optional allowance .
most men do not eat any sex @-@ rob@@ ots , while the FR@@ R will increase their increasing popular@@ ity , however , they still remain on the edge of the consumer culture .
but what inspired by the Rand@@ om zones that we can live in relation to the Spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily , until them the free market have been used for approval .
there is a certain convic@@ tion that these highly developed sex @-@ rob@@ ots in a time that are threatened with women worldwide , in which the rights of women are threatened to have an President that has grown in the White House , who attacked women to sexual violence .
the most hor@@ ror aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that affects the sw@@ imm@@ ed body , but as realistic these vision .
the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a jump , but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind this sex robot is to produce a physical simil@@ ar@@ ity to actual women as realistic as techn@@ ically possible ( if also using Por@@ nost@@ ar Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
their buil@@ der want to feel de@@ cent man to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , if it is about their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the rob@@ ots represent no real women .
they cannot be separate from their compan@@ ions or simply away .
they don &apos;t have a medi@@ ation or background history , nothing , what about independence or anything indicates that the imag@@ ination of the imag@@ ination may be inter@@ ference .
differ@@ ently , you are f@@ ake sl@@ aves .

Tr@@ um@@ ps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to protect the healthy human understanding ?
it &apos;s become a bin@@ ge time of the tr@@ ump era that have decided to have the US vot@@ ers that have chosen US vot@@ ers , even families in small scale .
around the Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest existed in the USA newspapers with advice about how to ren@@ der the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump transformation relations .
we felt all supp@@ os@@ edly on to leave our filter bub@@ bles .
less not@@ ices has been the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families .
I chose this because my co@@ usin , a lin@@ ks@@ ary poet , who has lived in Chicago , has been living in New York since l@@ ange@@ m with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family .
they remember@@ ed that the unity of a common enemy can have a mighty effect .
with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the repub@@ lican relationship , with which it had fighting for decades due to politics , suddenly and very strange at the same side .
in order to take the dining table , this is certainly a good cause , but it falls in a further context that it brings considerable risk with itself .
the Left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effect of his pre@@ sidency has the force to move forward to the right .
if we speak of &quot; normal@@ ization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cru@@ el opportunity that we will not be able to cast us out of a day .
however , there is yet another long @-@ term scenario in the tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alised , &quot; which appears to appear in comparison to its standards as in@@ set of failure .
I find it nowadays of a active nost@@ alg@@ ia for Mit@@ t &apos;s funny version of the re@@ trac@@ ting - the dog on the car roof , which saw 14 % income taxes ( but at least knew we know how his tax returns ) - which both occur in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild offen@@ ders .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be spiritu@@ ally healthy , to qualif@@ y as un@@ read@@ able improvement .
when my co@@ usin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ous@@ es of New York parking department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city when you need a caff@@ eine .
the horses have enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly large , fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all C@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ying and the animals turning to look at full of fe@@ aring over their own sh@@ oul@@ ders - extremely fin@@ ing and the k@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing music also acts as well as a not@@ able fashion .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appo@@ inting to the views of high buildings , the Sk@@ ylin@@ es are to offer to offer plenty of exc@@ it@@ ement , and the reality of the city will not be righteous .
five @-@ five years later , and I still had not yet over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the subject @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of Lon@@ d@@ ons .
however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &apos;s and all of them have a great time .
if I have been able to evalu@@ ate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given to him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked later .
on the other hand , I was forced to evalu@@ ate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same to balance the option with a 15 % tip to balance - this to buy something about the Lad@@ der .
this leads not only to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to put person@@ ality into a situation , which is not necessary .
the poor woman in the store stand was exc@@ ited , while I got ti@@ red the experience , you made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison in hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to the hospital , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death penalty for Mor@@ avia after the State of the State Pro@@ secut@@ ors .
he killed ste@@ el@@ amp in the early morning hours of the year 2013 , giving it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a closer influence , which was hidden in the cabin .
the State law@@ yers have announced their inten@@ tion to put on this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , from which they say that they should be too dense .
the National Criminal Tribunal for the National Court of South Africa announced that it will be dis@@ sol@@ ete by the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection of this year will be heard .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

Software Update for diesel vehicles : what do you need to know now
how accurate is the software update ?
do diesel @-@ driver have to participate in the action ?
the main questions and answers in the overview .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they are to improve the exhaust behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and sometimes Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or bad are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe is ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
no , the booked software updates are volun@@ tar@@ ily .
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates only apply to the vehicles that include Schum@@ ann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the KRA@@ FT@@ FA@@ HRT ( KBA ) ( KBA ) .
how and from where are customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturer have announced a gener@@ ous implementation in the next months , but still called no exact date .
Daimler has informed , each actu@@ alization .
if it is due to an inspection , this will be done in their frame .
how long does the need to go up ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; we@@ ep S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the curtains of the manufacturer of the manufacturer , as well as the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , volun@@ tar@@ ily negoti@@ ated the auto producer for the environment until now . &quot;
how long does the update should last ?
the conversion itself could last for 3 to four hours in the workshop .
tim@@ bers could be there , an appointment .
what do car driver that have no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will wait .
pres@@ um@@ ably would the foreign manufacturer would go , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now a massive price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE will be afraid .
but in the regions where driving conditions are threat@@ ening .
in rural space there has no imp@@ air@@ ment losses for older diesel .
the ACE will still wait for sale .

we do the city life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s city building , dates back to Ren@@ te next year .
the place is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are r@@ ar .
for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work is still great fun , as he will publish in the press conference .
he reports varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , however , it &apos;s no application to fill the challeng@@ ing profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time a architects or design engineer .
so , - below the regular cancellation of the cancellation - still enough time for a lon@@ el@@ ab@@ oration .
since Has@@ lach for the administration of administration as a subst@@ itute judge , the applic@@ ant must pres@@ cri@@ bed the applic@@ ants .
because this function wants to keep the city on each case .
if they cannot fill out this , they would have to drive the citizens to Off@@ enburg until Off@@ enburg .
but the inhabitants of the city and himself is important , W@@ acker says of a good operating climate , as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in over 30 years , some important projects have accum@@ ulated , based on the W@@ acker with pri@@ de .
&quot; we make the city vi@@ vid , &quot; he is over the building site and his employees safe .
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Netherlands @-@ car park .
the Kin@@ z@@ ig@@ brücke between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject .
the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros a be@@ ech , &quot; if we make it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all wait great tasks on my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design have been present for a city expansion in large game room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s , own building yard and gar@@ den@@ ner@@ ei could be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted on multiple properties .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green con@@ soles are often mentioned by citizens and visitors often .
since the old town is under mon@@ uments , it is important to have one eye for this , what it fits , if new building has been approved , st@@ ressed the separ@@ ating city master .
S@@ ohn@@ eh@@ in is wearing high respon@@ si@@ bilities in the cit@@ y@@ master .
it is Bau@@ herr , &quot; at the end all this is running on my table . &quot;
for care and coordin@@ ation , he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working with Manfred Schö@@ ner ( dr@@ en@@ bau ) for 15 years .
even so that his successor remains long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who would really be identified with the spot . &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .
who would like to know who like Roland W@@ acker would like to provide information about the town of Has@@ lach , a graduate studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with specialist architecture in the areas of construction and construction law .

Bicycle on pipes : southern route closed
according to the police , so far , the blue bike was thrown by the track track in the Le@@ o@@ ge road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so strongly damaged that the down@@ turn of freight had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male per@@ pet@@ rators and search for night hours after them .
near the Tat@@ ort was witnesses to a ros@@ ar@@ oter run@@ ners and a bike driver had been observed .
&quot; that goes beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ stein , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A .
the per@@ pet@@ rators , or the per@@ pet@@ rators are killed himself in big risk and also end@@ ang@@ ered the train .
in addition to the damage to the lo@@ co and plant , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail products could also come to the per@@ pet@@ rators .
in total , a total of &quot; significant &quot; sum , said the speaker .
the damages were fixed at the Friday afternoon , the railway bridge could be led without dis@@ abilities .
almost ten motor@@ ists were out again , two of which concerned the correspondence .
freight charges did not fly , however , they had delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be ex@@ changed around 200 metres of upper lines .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , da@@ iry products and chocolate could help , I@@ BD ( flamm@@ able represent@@ ations ) to lin@@ dern
red meat and chocolate can be used for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claimed exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and da@@ iry products , the symptoms of patients with ad@@ orable represent@@ ations left .
the healed state , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300,000 , causes mag@@ icians and blo@@ od@@ ings , recur@@ ring or blo@@ ody accid@@ ents , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness .
during the affected usually , meat and da@@ iry products to prevent their symptoms , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an of proteins , develop immun@@ otherapy , develop a toler@@ ant loan .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the Dar@@ m pat@@ rol to ensure that harm@@ ful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the body , not into the body .
cells that are im@@ perfor@@ ated , inflamm@@ ation are infl@@ amed of cells , prot@@ ecting the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive t@@ issues .
if the balance is toward inflamm@@ ation , it may cause an anti @-@ inflamm@@ ation result .
in experiments this species was determined that a kind of tolerance promot@@ ing immun@@ otherapy in mice , which apply a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ atives .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to resol@@ ve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between bacter@@ ial @-@ species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells which promote the tolerance is made .
the more tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an ever had the mice in their food , the more they had them from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ant , less flamm@@ able mil@@ it@@ us if the same system also conf@@ usion .
the post@@ pon@@ tor@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an searched a kind of immune cell that had found the tolerance that a group of study ma@@ ids such cells had , but a different group of the same tribe that was separated , but had not been ho@@ oked .
they susp@@ ected that the difference of the int@@ est@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , normally live in the stomach &apos;s int@@ est@@ inal tract .
the mice were found DNA sequence and were found six bacter@@ ial types that were in mice with the immune cells , but without these were missing in mice .
mice were mounted in a sterile environment , so that them was lack@@ ed a certain micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. cruci@@ ter@@ i and the immun@@ otherapy .
in order to understand how the bacteria had grown to the immune system , the researchers sei@@ zed the cruci@@ fixes in a liquid and then reduced the small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria , and they were isolated from mice .
the immun@@ otherapy developed on the tolerance of tolerance cells .
as an active component of the liquid has been cle@@ ans@@ ed , it proved to be regarded as a secondary product of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as in@@ do@@ l 3 da@@ iry acid .
if the researchers examined the amount of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that most of us cruci@@ fixes in our stomach cross@@ ings .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an @-@ side @-@ products from L. cruci@@ ter@@ i have been such as mice , but def@@ ects in Gen@@ es in relation to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an people were found in people with ad@@ orable represent@@ ations .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells probably is something that we want to promote , because these cells are inflamm@@ ation on the internal surface of Dar@@ ms .
potenti@@ ally , high tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to a extent of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ inho believes that Manchester United with Nem@@ an@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
in Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; by Nem@@ an@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; says Jose Mo@@ ur@@ inho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der he had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the Chelsea co@@ dex started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last @-@ season game before the UEFA Cup event begins on Tuesday and impressive in the holder role , as people as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Pereira according to taste .
M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of bl@@ ues , and managed only 45 minutes , which had to improve Mo@@ ur@@ inho , that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League @-@ season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the kind , such as he th@@ inks - he think football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ inho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready later than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u died in the A@@ vi@@ va stadium when Mo@@ ur@@ inho began his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the In@@ dependent revealed that Mo@@ ur@@ inho still wish three more new boarding money , but he &apos;s in@@ sist@@ ed that the club had already performed a &quot; fantastic work &quot; , three of his four priority ship .
&quot; three of four to receive , thanks to the association , &quot; added he added .
&quot; I will be happy if they get four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. air@@ plane producer Boeing has painted the sil@@ hou@@ ette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flo@@ wn by Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US @-@ State Mich@@ ig@@ an , and in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted for 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar bre@@ ll@@ as the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a durable test for new engines .
Boeing had already made earlier this advertising .
so the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new dr@@ en@@ schlag for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind of the wind revol@@ ves , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still had the SPD head , an Socialist and democratic minister pre@@ sidents are always with a certain conc@@ ern after Berlin .
only no inter@@ f@@ euer out of the party central , just no head@@ wind from the federal government - so loud as the principal desire of the suff@@ ers .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , has changed considerably .
since then , members from the Willy @-@ Brandt house has since then conduc@@ ting the events in the SPD govern@@ ed state capit@@ als .
since the beginning of the year , what Schulz have been given since the beginning of the year , he would not be described in the way .
there were deep places .
and one after the other .
the Bun@@ des @-@ CD@@ U looks after the end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; it shows a bit more : red @-@ green , simply govern@@ ed no exc@@ it@@ ly , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , the Editor network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the sur@@ prising con@@ fr@@ action of a Green M@@ EP@@ s , the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a severe crisis by the Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) .
five months before the landing , his red @-@ green Co@@ alition lost their An @-@ voices majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Bundes@@ Managing Director Michael Keller has ur@@ ged the dis@@ rup@@ ted Lower Saxony @-@ MP@@ s El@@ ke Twe@@ eter to return to their mand@@ ate .
the over@@ jo@@ ins to CD@@ U means a clear sli@@ des@@ ires of vot@@ ers .
El@@ ke Twe@@ eter must immediately return to their mand@@ ate , &quot; said the Federal Office and Ele@@ ction Head of Economic Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; that may all not be true , there is a SPD electoral campaign , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ anist has reached the party centre on Friday morning .
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands under the remains of the green MP@@ s Twe@@ eter to CD@@ U without their own government .
it is the provis@@ ional highlight of a whole range of large and small cr@@ ises in the SPD Land .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the gen@@ u@@ ous time .
everything will be different from the shore elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
this was then too - and in fact everything is much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a ro@@ uting , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ in hau@@ te facing the party .
during the weeks , the com@@ rad@@ es got up again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when she had a new cour@@ age , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came to the next draft .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ y while his city burnt down .
and because he continued in the cr@@ unch communications there@@ after quite anything wrong , what you can do wrong .
ever since then , Sch@@ olz was fighting for his political survival .
so also Stephan W@@ eil still now .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the super@@ visory board of the Angl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister had already been in the critic@@ ism .
Mi@@ ese Re@@ fresh values came added .
nevertheless , or maybe just why , W@@ eil tried to set up over the last weeks in the bunch of Ak@@ z@@ ente .
the fore@@ most of the former civil master from Hanover , power to build his power in Berlin , also stayed com@@ rad@@ es in category Martin Schulz will not be hidden .
they for@@ war@@ ned him , since they spoke of W@@ eil a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now , the exact opposite could occur .
in this morning , W@@ eil is due to the part@@ n@@ ity of the Lower Gre@@ ens Par@@ ents no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz are not at all .
insert the com@@ rad@@ es in order to keep their own rows closed .
your wrath is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the back@@ sliding parliamentary elections .
&quot; it &apos;s in@@ definitely and dem@@ ocrac@@ ies , such as Mrs. Twe@@ est their own career at the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party in the SPD Bundestag in the German Social Forum , Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. Twe@@ sten is not elected until its person as direct di@@ dat@@ as , but on the state list of the Lower Gre@@ ens Par@@ liamentary Assembly was elected in Parliament , so the Sax@@ on Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
the logical consequ@@ ence would be that her mand@@ ate is returned .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Federal Parliament , pro@@ claim a &quot; und@@ em@@ ocratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ ers of four years ago was clear : the people have done Stephan W@@ eil as the Minister of Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the lower @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as the top of the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND .
&quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U member will result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he asked the back@@ grounds to clar@@ ify .
I want to know if there is more or more continuous support of CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
convey@@ ors of Ort@@ is@@ ers III
who wants to leave his house within the years , can be coming from the country for coming soon .
about this , the may@@ or Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives ST@@ EC city development began on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again a review of the date .
since 1991 it has been able to discuss it in the emp@@ ty@@ ing areas .
at that time , in the con@@ servation area of I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thir@@ ds of the funding .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the audience was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous sanctions is a &quot; successful project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the internal development , and not only new construction areas .
on April 4 , you will receive information from the meeting in Karlsruhe , where it will give it a san@@ itation area III .
the total amount amounts to 8@@ 33 333 , of which 500 000 Euro come from the country , the rema@@ inder of the comm@@ une began .
how is a san@@ itation area ?
one will continue to exam@@ ine so Sch@@ in@@ dler continue , exam@@ ine where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it plays also a role whether in the planned area at all interest consist of interest .
in any case , the territory could also be post@@ hum@@ ed again .
the ST@@ EC Trust on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the content of the federal states &quot; program &quot; Social city , &quot; whose frame would be performed .
the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner city , impro@@ ving the living and working conditions and delivery of infrastructure .
the measures would be obj@@ ection , that is per plot per property .
finally , the san@@ itation area was finally established as a stat@@ utes .
the auth@@ oriz@@ ation period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 2026 .
however , until September of this year , however , the ingredients could be carried out only once the inventory of the quest@@ ionn@@ aires at the sanctions apply a quest@@ ionn@@ aire .
in November or December the pro@@ position shall be given to the pro@@ position to be begun in the coming year with the sanctions .
after that , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every comm@@ une will conduct the alleged prec@@ eding research .
it has to evalu@@ ate the city of urban p@@ ests and decide to decide when san@@ it@@ ated and in what extent is .
it will also be en@@ rolled in the basic book for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after received even a picture of the location , she promised them .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ized , a significant success factor for the project is the participation of the participating interests .
therefore , it will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens over the coming weeks PO@@ STA@@ L@@ AN to citizens and will be filled until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow quest@@ ionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and bound@@ ary , &quot; by which it works among others in the de@@ grad@@ able state and san@@ itation pro@@ spects .
in the gray quest@@ ionn@@ aire , the &quot; households and housing , &quot; allow information to size , distribution and inhabitants of a housing .
the blue &quot; working bow is only going to fill if the buildings can be operated .
however , in notice , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed quest@@ ionn@@ aire is not a application for funding at the same time .
moreover , new construction measures are not convey@@ ed .
Sch@@ in@@ dler is still st@@ ressed that the distribution of funding after &quot; wind@@ y @-@ principle &quot; functional , &quot; who first comes first comes first .
one could have no support for later &quot; reserve . &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ is@@ ers II &quot; were shown to make the approach a renovation . &quot;

the decision of the White House , a marine helicop@@ ter for an event , which increases the American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military , which have been transferred to the TIME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president goes on board , was the heart piece of the event on July 17th in the White House .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , vice president Mike pl@@ ence and conduc@@ tive civil servants made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the helicop@@ ter installed in Conn@@ ecti@@ cut helicop@@ ter was made from a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House requested the presence of helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ ment@@ ative order or WO@@ GO , hardly 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for operation of helicop@@ ter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of this , because it is an unusual event with high visual acu@@ ity , &quot; he wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of his superior , the dep@@ uty Nav@@ al man@@ ure for aviation .
the message showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 p.m. , and so long stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening was cle@@ ared .
the note adds to that , if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the restri@@ ction of the service hours a second crew would be needed .
the original air@@ stat@@ utes was located during the event with the helicop@@ ter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground with the plane .
out of the TIME available records , it wasn &apos;t clear whether the second flight crew was necessary .
the Hatch Act provides federal state to use state property for political purposes .
data records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could inj@@ ure the determination .
&quot; a question that we thought it was about a viol@@ ation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , he answered the Deputy Commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event and was not covered by Brands Hatch Act .
but also official events have political upper tones .
on the event , the President issued a c@@ lash for reform of health reform that was in the Senate , and he proph@@ es@@ ied to the efforts of government regulations .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is of political pre @-@ propor@@ tion@@ aries , hardly a new phenom@@ enon .
President are ob@@ li@@ ged to use them for the journey .
but their use only require for a photo surgery , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February , as the presidential aircraft in front of his first camp@@ a@@ ign@@ ers r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and its Twitter account is full of messages that has been mod@@ elled by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that will be manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the subst@@ itute of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 sett@@ l@@ ements are often leading training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn by exp@@ ecting US President in the White House with precise Zenti@@ met@@ ers@@ sets .
as a tr@@ ump of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 practice sessions .
the flight to the &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted by the training needs of the flight stat@@ utes for the month , said a civil servant .
in addition , hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter units flo@@ wn in addition to 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential statements . &quot;
the White House said that the tax spot@@ lights the burden for no other request to be presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in it , including helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no bud@@ get@@ ed recordings for the presidential trips , and it &apos;s difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to St@@ und@@ entar@@ y@@ en of the 2017 US Secretary of Defense 2017 , the Do@@ D aud@@ itor for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flying hour .
the unit recorded a 30 @-@ minute flight time from the home @-@ based Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House arg@@ um@@ ented that the actual costs for the operation of helicop@@ ters are far below this rate .
&quot; the costs of the tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the provision must be determined , is highly respec@@ ted , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 included the provision for Do@@ D not included the staff , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Conn@@ ecti@@ cut is very proud to contri@@ bute to our national security , and I go out of that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent .
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked un@@ ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
it is natural enough to take it . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with the helicop@@ ter inter@@ acted as he under@@ went his round about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Ash@@ er@@ ons with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; this is a compact team that plays always in quite similar formation .

&quot; the Dane and Fin@@ ds can even be used for operations in the Davis Cup .

the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is enormous .
nevertheless , it was too early for an assessment of the consequences , the official statement of the oil group .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked after that the group could re@@ b@@ ursed , and which could really do him .

back@@ wards : the city represents 46 kitchen help .
the city organized the K@@ ita lunch break itself again .
with fixed support partners for the children and a sub@@ ordin@@ ance to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ g@@ athers , the watch is turned back .
as of September 1st , the City of Kre@@ feld will take over the area of Es@@ bri@@ gade in the urban children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pomm@@ er@@ anz , Vice @-@ Chief of the Youth Centre , this is a good news : &quot; we all have very pleased . &quot;
bo@@ iled to the house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task , and supplies fresh bo@@ iled ch@@ illed .
the city operates in the Kre@@ felder area 46 kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens , in 44 the children are for lunch time a warm meal .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ year , 2800 children of the tables are growing stead@@ ily , and the need is constantly growing .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are care for 45 lessons , are invited to noon in the K@@ ita , &quot; explained french fri@@ es .
&quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour supervision if children stay open till 14 . &quot;
46 partial points from the 1st September Kitchen service : you have heat up the ste@@ wed food , compl@@ ement them around Sal@@ ad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tions the meal , give the food from , rooms , rin@@ se and clean@@ se the kitchen .
&quot; the workforce are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pomm@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ ed like the seven @-@ group facilities - cru@@ is@@ ers over the hours of the hours .
&quot; the kitchen tra@@ ilers are now fixed toward the K@@ ita team , &quot; says French fri@@ endl@@ iness .
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement it for the kit@@ es@@ itation of ped@@ agog@@ ic concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s why we are : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children are to prepare food for food . &quot;
the direct connection of the c@@ ows is to be sen@@ sible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , one person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing men . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for the kids .
the cham@@ ber@@ ing of the K@@ ita rooms - so far , according to the kitchen carrier - is appointed as well as the future of spe@@ e@@ ering cleaning .
this version - the separation of cle@@ ans@@ ing and kitchen services - has also the charm of quality improvement in the kitchen power , which prev@@ ail@@ ed in the cost between own rule and foreign currency for the city as the most economic , the press office is from the press office .
and that , though 46 power supply will be rest@@ art@@ ed .
&quot; but these hours do not fall around 750 people in the detection zone not so strongly in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pomm@@ er@@ anz .

more than 500 employees work in the plant , which houses Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that staff and trade union representatives &quot; would be the first &quot; to change if their activities could change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to make a concerns that the financing is not powered by production lines . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win the general site manager and investment plans for the future of rab@@ bits , where our members are de@@ eper .
generations of families have worked here and the work force focused strongly on local community and the Greater Glasgow , a major pillar for human dig@@ al employment in an area with high unemployment and social notification .
therefore , under the perspective of job , the wage and well@@ being , and before the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , increasing the cost of life and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow had urg@@ ent a flat production capacity at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch manager at rab@@ bi has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will re@@ act directly to the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives .
we had two months ago a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at rab@@ bi , where some questions are discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we are working like all companies that are working in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain business climate that we are ongoing - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
in the last years , we added more than 5 million pounds in our rab@@ bi location , especially in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognize the Heritage of rab@@ he@@ a as a production site and totally . we should change our operations at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago ?
the site of La Liga may your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not listed in their per@@ secution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after they have given an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ per@@ ate his free trial , but they have war@@ ned them in front of the world for three years ago ?
the sens@@ ational approach has set the tran@@ sit window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than double the previous brand , Paul Pog@@ ba fell in the past season for 89 million pounds in Manchester United States .
after termination , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athletes of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is a mot@@ hers above the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has to en@@ for@@ ced his path , although a source near Catal@@ an Executive Board exists that the club has always been given that the club has always been given to take care of Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world war@@ ned three years ago from the PS@@ G president .
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bl@@ aise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I wasn &apos;t wor@@ ried because they want to touch one of our players , then we will present in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
however , if they try to draw a player in our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish club was interested in the beginning of this summer party at the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made it clearly that it would not allow it to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ ack@@ atzen report on the Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the ra@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ ot@@ atzen report about the ab@@ use of the Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s account .
the author and hist@@ orian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report about the Miss@@ issi@@ sk@@ and@@ al at the Dom@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ ot@@ atzen provides further discussions for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ n@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared to the publication facing the German press agency , and called Kar@@ d@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Pope Benedict XVI R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ itus of Pope Benedict XVI .
it would serve the view of the cat@@ holic church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger had their deep@@ est thre@@ ats over their own lower sections , or to press brie@@ fly out of the processes .
the State Chanc@@ ellery &quot; O@@ ss@@ erv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; is a critical fact that in reporting on violence against the dom@@ ination of dom@@ ination with &quot; two @-@ di@@ vers measures . &quot;
regarding the attack in Regensburg , nobody doubt that it would have to be conf@@ id@@ ent and damaged de@@ eds &quot; in order to be pun@@ ished , but the &quot; Grad @-@ medi@@ al man@@ ip@@ ulation , &quot; thus the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the national itali@@ an organic commit@@ tees .
&quot; the rel@@ atives to record the Catholic Church as a source of all evil thoughts , is already part of everyday life experience and preparing the public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis meant the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go on the church , and it &apos;s a folded fres@@ her . &quot;
in addition , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; saw a quite ordinary means that &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one of them . &quot;
they feder@@ ate it un@@ fair , present standards for earlier decades , because the world have changed .
in connection with the reports about the per@@ su@@ al accid@@ ents , Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger also occurs in connection with the reports .
totally too bad , we@@ ep author and hist@@ orian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; says the results of the final report .
what exactly is at the 440 @-@ page report that was sent from the di@@ oc@@ ese in Regensburg with the Att@@ orney General Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ ag@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high levels of exc@@ essi@@ bility , 67 Dom@@ ag@@ atzen are sex@@ ually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; sum@@ mar@@ ized that the dom@@ ic@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases were applied physi@@ cally and psych@@ ological violence .
at high emot@@ ion , the pun@@ ishment of the pupils could also be f@@ ier@@ ed for students .
non@@ eth@@ eless , contrary to many other acc@@ uses , many victims were estimated the general crimes of R. estimated and therefore , in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview H@@ es@@ emann , the final report of the Miss@@ issi@@ s@@ al , explains the final report to the De@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ mo@@ ck Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages report about the &quot; incid@@ ents of violence to protection against the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ ag@@ atzen &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ ell@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
he will raise many students his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other , it appears also known as chol@@ esterol and perf@@ ect@@ ist , which was far more promin@@ ent when an Dom@@ Sp@@ atz had no top performance .
how do you do than its bi@@ ograph this final report ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read the trouble and reads the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one must be wonder@@ ing why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
in him just eight pages are dedicated , and he is acqu@@ ain@@ ted clearly by any sus@@ pic@@ ion of economic or mit@@ ig@@ ence in the terri@@ ble cases of sexual ab@@ use .
violent actions are also reflected in the pre@@ school , outside of its effects .
it can re@@ bu@@ ke him if too late , too late or first suggest@@ ions couldn &apos;t be taken enough .
the cathedral mo@@ ist gramm@@ ar school , which he worked from practi@@ cally all respon@@ dents than - so lit@@ eral - &quot; re@@ dem@@ ption , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
so also the wide majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is a very excellent bear witness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compet@@ ent , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ent &quot; , &quot; compet@@ ent , &quot; compet@@ ent , &quot; compet@@ ent , &quot; compet@@ ent , and &quot; always in the grapes of children . &quot;
only one min@@ ority is described above his PER@@ FE@@ C@@ TION@@ ISM and its high emot@@ ion , who also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages .
that he is not only kno@@ cked out with the keys and the key b@@ und on the ground , but also ear@@ liest boys to the hair or ears , he had already admitted himself already before years , too deep and exc@@ uses .
however , in his honour of honour must be said , however , such salvation methods in the un@@ question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , widely used , with parents such as teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us , who was born before 1968 .
I have experienced that even in a worldwide school , a state school of a state school .
compared to what it is actually in this report , namely , the de@@ position of sexual ab@@ use and non@@ violence at the pre@@ school , the nau@@ il@@ ich Bag@@ at@@ elles .
as we ask , whether it doesn &apos;t have to do with his acqu@@ itt@@ ness and his role as brother of Benedikt XVI . many media has straight on him .
the Bavarian Pope , however , works many that never understood him , even more ei@@ fri@@ g .
but the truth is : the report was determined by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , a lot about the topic ab@@ use of ab@@ use in the Dom@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ ot@@ atzen was reported in connection with the report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also use any destruction or con@@ science in terms of sexual ab@@ use in terms of sexual ab@@ use ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 vic@@ tim of sexual inter@@ ventions claimed to have already familiar to the Dom@@ ot@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were con@@ se@@ cr@@ ated .
&quot; I never get@@ ed my father , my father or mother , &quot; said one of the people , &quot; I told me all very handy . &quot;
the true problem with the declaration of sexual ab@@ use and is that most victims from shame will be silent .
if they did not commit their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then surely not a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been a colle@@ ague of the per@@ pet@@ rators .
how to evalu@@ ate the domain Shi@@ a Student R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers Role with regard to the Miss@@ ing accid@@ ents ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ ed student form@@ ulated like this : &quot; concerning sexual ab@@ use ... no case , in which he calculated ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had to have been able to have had been able to stop and had the respective activity .
I keep it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d to assume that it is calculated ... bu@@ ben infl@@ ated or cle@@ ar@@ er or even more , than opposite to their parents , Internet leaders , confi@@ denti@@ als etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
this report also comes to the very clear result : &quot; that , in the field of affected students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual ab@@ use is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thus re@@ ach of all of them .
thus , it cannot be rejected , it cannot be avo@@ ided or put it to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good names with these re@@ lu@@ ent crime in connection , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
in the media there was much of &quot; violence against &quot; violence to the Dom@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ ot@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be indicted in the report .
does he have to live with this preview ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the coverage of all missed and prev@@ ail@@ ed in a giant mel@@ ange from sexual ab@@ use and non@@ violence and anywhere , in the midst of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly that is again a mis@@ use of reports .
then it is clean separated : between the pre@@ school and high school of the Dom@@ ot@@ atzen , between sexual ab@@ use and non@@ violence as well as , we say once , other courts .
in addition , a report from the period since 1945 , i.e. from four decades , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger wasn &apos;t ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ ot@@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful test Ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which the boys were law@@ ful and scen@@ ic , and including terri@@ ble , all@@ es@@ amt of the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sk@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to have reign@@ ed .
but with those who had nothing to do with Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the cathedral mo@@ ist gramm@@ ar school .
on it was how the most witnesses emphas@@ ize the theme &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; Tab@@ u .
it was only happy to be cancelled and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ we@@ gian &quot; states .
what was different on the cathedral @-@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ al ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was already discipl@@ ine , but there is no aci@@ dic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , with the report to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estimated the general call of R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot;
so , at the most , the pre@@ diction shall be stopped .
however , in spite of all efforts , the report was defined only two periods which was reported to him from the circumstances on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and had not been responsible for the processes at a school which he had not really worked and responsible , ( so the witness ) would not hear , and then only in 1993 again .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger decided in front of the circumstances , the ears of the ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium .
in this way , he demonstr@@ ates this way , &quot; that in the pre@@ school we will still pract@@ ised the test . &quot;
even in view of the risk of negative press reports , he was strongly scre@@ ened .
it was of course at a time when legal clarity was prohib@@ ited as testing pun@@ ish@@ ments in Bavaria .
before that , she looked at a right gre@@ y@@ zone , like everyone from us are still white .
there was also hard to complete for him , where the people were perhaps ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ atic , and where really the permitted limit was exceeded .
but it can &apos;t say that he would have gone away .
this is not true .
only in 1980 , the test penalty was abol@@ ished in Bavaria in Bavaria .
Für@@ st@@ in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis acknowle@@ dged that it was un@@ fair to use today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at the time .
how do you see it ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking of hist@@ orian of &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; which is the danger , past to present day mor@@ al standards .
since the prin@@ cip@@ ality has already been right .
but this is not true for sexual ab@@ use , who was fired at all times , and not for that which was interrup@@ ted in pre@@ school and violence against inno@@ cent children , which goes beyond the back then .
that is all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally opened .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its funds for discipl@@ inary and pun@@ ishment , so ear@@ ning and ears to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when the body &apos;s pun@@ ishment he was forbidden , he has also been stri@@ pped .
what is the picture of his ra@@ ens@@ burger time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger said to the talks with you for the book &quot; My Br@@ other of the Pope &quot; ?
came the topic Tests also in language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : now , in the book the life of his brother Joseph , says Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , since they played the dom@@ ination only a secondary part .
nevertheless , I knew that there was a stric@@ tly ra@@ iment to be there .
but also that must be said once again : without these PER@@ FE@@ C@@ TION@@ IS@@ M@@ US , without creating un@@ cond@@ itional discipl@@ ine , it would probably hardly have been possible from the nation@@ wide known reg@@ imen of Europe and his musical tradition that went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no great sing@@ ers and before every success , right in which area , still discipl@@ ine , passion , and self over@@ comes .
what a man have you experienced for a man by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the talks of her book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : from the work on the book and in addition , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well known and repeat@@ edly seen as a wonderful , hum@@ orous and warm people , of whom you cannot imagine that he could only allow a fly something .
I &apos;m waiting regularly with how many former Dom@@ Ã atzen are still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly visit him to visit him , he is almost blind - and it is as a member of their family .
those who have not for@@ given him to today that he had stric@@ tly too close to them , so is the min@@ ority in min@@ ority .
most Dom@@ estic atzen are th@@ ank@@ ful to him today , that he en@@ ri@@ ched their lives and brought them the world of the music .
and that he always is a good we@@ alth@@ y teacher - a str@@ enger father , un@@ ite , that may be , but also a lov@@ able respec@@ t@@ ect@@ son , who still had to look at it , and honour her .
and yet again , all of you know what to happen to him , are experi@@ encing methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad that we have been running this time .
but it is very un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ent and one more promin@@ ent brother , to make the medi@@ al sin@@ ners .
there is the evil inten@@ tion that stands in behind , just too obviously .
because the report which has just been published , last@@ im@@ ated him .
now the cultiv@@ ated area would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired major mer@@ its and without the outside of Bay@@ ern@@ s , and perhaps Germany would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ ag@@ atzen in Germany .
