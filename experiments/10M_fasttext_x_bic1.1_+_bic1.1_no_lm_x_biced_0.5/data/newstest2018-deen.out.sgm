<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, how cities and municipalities in the Munich region of Munich has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickering stage, which you don't know as such as such as such.</seg>

<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the example of the state capital of the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has increased in all directions and has been growing.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is undernealing, that is still relatively isolation in the card of 1856.</seg>

<seg id="26">Where today is the West park, one sees nothing than fields - at the first glance: when the single player appears a smallish map with dutzing lines and numbers: handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called "Urals" which was derived from the land tax.</seg>

<seg id="51">The National Association for funding of color has issued a warning for colored people who travel through the discriminating policies and racial attacks by the State of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri, taking into force until 28 August 2017, demands special attention to exchange and foremost intention, since a series of fragmise, terrace-based incidents occur in the entire state and here," says it in the position of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent authorization of Missouri, which makes it heavy, discriminating authorities, as well as the prosecution of government, disproportionate the group trying to publish the itinerary, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injury of civil rights to pass people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They become comprised because of their skin colours, they will be merged or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such frequencies which we haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited as racial against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the beginning of the year, Sanders died in the beginning of the year after he had no petrol, and had taken out by the police of Missouri, without having accuse a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council shows a recent report by the Office of the general state administration of Missouri, in which it will be more likely to be more likely than the white motorists in the state 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are conscious and their families, friends and employees are inform about that which could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>

<seg id="64">The journey is also a response to a new Missouri Law, which would be difficult to do a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) were issued for Texas and Arizona, after the states adopted unmigration agencies, committed to enforced people due to immigration procedures, which is contributing to the ACLU to further railer profile.</seg>
<seg id="66">Itessings will be viewed as a rule from the Ministry of Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in the last time, the intervention should be deployed on certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Pastoral project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishbacher Weidecaun project is a successful project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag amended Peter White and Kordula Kovac acquired a picture before the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right-time of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fishbacher CDU area met together with the Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann refuses first insights into its operation, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest cultivated, 40 dacows and as well as many young and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmilk" is the alternative formarketable digestive ways for the milk of his cows, so Swan.</seg>
<seg id="73">Exclusively to the table of the holidays, exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLHV-chairman of Fishbach, he is also important for the "elementar project."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't stand on derart surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area worry for much work, many things to be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have struggled here with the conditions and with the Topography," stressed Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elabortive operation and managed these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he lead no biooperations.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the local community has known the importance of the pasteurship projects and is happy about the leader funding."</seg>
<seg id="80">At a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoping that the rearmament of the surfaces could go out a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and thoughts about how they continued to bring their operation," stressed the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often due to funding in the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is about 40 hectares, which are not checked by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half over leader was funded, a quarter carried out the fishing area.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers absent 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of women.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do a really good job, without farmers and farming."</seg>
<seg id="90">And Peter White stood firm: "the best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The State Court of Cardiology (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the public transport of wheat gerences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The revelations of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a sponsor of the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the extenuous area must not be beneficable (hangings above 35 percent) and must be threatened by sensation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build up close to 16 km of fence in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open area is about 35 hectares, the cost of the costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is now decreases to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime change is, if they begin to attach the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate these equally as any other - therefore the careful crash of Saddam Husseins were on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-Regimes, knew what he did, when he did a symbolic Axt in a hitzky strife with Jim Acosta by CNN concerning the suggestions of the President to drastic restriction with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller was not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of Boat owned and Liberty Imitators had got him to wynote when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he laid the importance of its importance, and in particular the importance that was attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As an Miller Acosta: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom, which lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">Poem, which you refer to that later, and not part of the original statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is sachite properly, but as he formulated it, does not really say about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance to the words of Lazarus, the only, in which a state is not just any old immigrants, but the physicians of the poor: "your labor, your poor, let him sighed, free to breathe, and the waste of your rich cows."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time to watch out on our screens better.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not involved in literary criticism - he did clearly that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict for the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural development: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who decided to place her words after their death in the base - knew quite good that they had completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicitism by taking them in an abused classic representation of the feminine origin of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this significance: in its poem, the female figure no longer retract. she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves also have a very other name: mother of excellence.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus has changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the buyer for the coming of Trump, argumented in 2010 that the liberty Statue of Liberty was invited, but rather a early neo-servative that bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is going on.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the trackel of freedom of the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusual is Limbaugh here too little.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and a question of the standest of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phenomenon indeed of Lazarus was lying in it, as they were seen by the exhausted, elding, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travelling on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome which they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is not the perspective that you want to recognize the Miller and Trump ever.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch is not to shine the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignites.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black loaves Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two shallots to the UK</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance of the Track of the People's Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship team will afford a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athlete was selected for London in 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland is something special" and the Track of the United Kingdom had to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to find it until we'll need to figure," said Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has done something to do what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish Athlete think that it has done something to do what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are awarded medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher - which was to compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Your chapters was unbelievable, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of Athlete, no matter whether they were scottish or practice them, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that fidh all of course was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-silver medal winner, which will compete in its fifth World Championships at 400 m Hurdles, says that it is unbelievably, that 16 shallots in the British crew.</seg>
<seg id="145">In Scotland, Scotland is the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, the 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The distance series Muir is leading up on this path and took place in five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is another shakot that one should win the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games, which should observe the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of its first World Championships, when the only other scarlet's team was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team capitalism says that they are "enormously proud" on the fact that many of their land sleek not only belong to team, but in some cases also with medals and with the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing of team capitals, lies in it, that it was worth a great honour to know, but to know that my team mate is tuned for me," makes it something very special for me, "added it.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I'm very proud of all the scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we are come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as a well-established athlete, athletes who want to go on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What do I think about my speech?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it worked fine.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to set up this home support and benefit that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and to contour and it is simply as a great atmosphere there was without. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Signposted by critics on Facebook: don't throw yourself a public position if you don't want to reduce the chance of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers will beat him for everything, from the inner policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shelled at the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">In 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of freedom can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, as they are led as the sheep for the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions from at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union refused him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol, and the online-comment was full of a counteraction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest conciliation of the nation of 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">HOGAN is not a reactionary hunter head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has a strong hand during the leadership of his state and strict disposition of principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">Also, it was also sent to use Facebook as primer funds to connect to his voters and play his hair-less head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the side of the Governors - which is officially designated as officially designated and of employees, which will be paid by public tax points - unnecessary and ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defending the spokesperson's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse attacked the actions of the Governors and argumented, that the block of comments nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of TROLLEN or chambers or water-filled people that sweep online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post said with some of the real people, blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leadership, a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no comfort.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments are respectful, proven and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyers Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not filled, but they asked them to hate them.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current messages," wrote in the commentary "The Post Office."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I think this idea too, if a number of people aged on the same subject, then they become more than a so-called collective benefit, and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the members of the governor as "focused on-attack" would probably be "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to feed a message by using simply a critic, or negative comment by using a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you have had the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conductins and incandise demonstrators, and to bring up protesters and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">HOGAN is not the first public officials, who criticises the Facebook and other social media has been impacted.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users, which were blocked from his Twitter feeds.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the board of Supervisors of Loudoun County confessed the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when they knew one voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU on Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers perched between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were struck down on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even Washington had anonymous troll.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Belisarius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticises its position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, according to the historic documents, according to the historical documents that were collected by the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't have them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of freedom and discourses are based on the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership, which means to accept.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, which have been established in 2011 by UEFA European Life, that PSG would have been claimed that the transfer of Neymar was financed without large losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar is receiving a salary that will amount to $10 million a year.</seg>

<seg id="1130">The former French players believed that betrayed in their spreads after success of tremendous debt had taken care, effectively frying and riskened, when banks or owner passed their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP lost its concentration to the debts of clubs on the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The amendment was meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then invested strongly to build the crew and to build a global stamp - a toughest matter.</seg>

<seg id="1141">While a cataric company could exceed the PSG sponsors, if the value of the Sponsorship should not exceed the default market rates, the UEFA these would not be considered a legitimate income.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia Nostalgia "Wet Hot American Summer" and "COMRADE Detective" into the Nic</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of the story is nostalgic because of the glorful days of characters from the 80-er years, and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As cultural species, it is equally a parody and a salespersion of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But when Franchise feels like it feels the time.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not just because of his absurthe humors (it contained a original history for speaking vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By clicking on the core of the gate - actor average age to play children who are grown to grow - they still managed to win the impossibility to win the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally disturbed, and his parody goes on the stalk movies of the 90's, like "The hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand, the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At a point, a character by a Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovable Coop (Mr. Show alter), now Romanautor, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau) still not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost its virgins.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-malignant plot, in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showage), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Like always the exchange rates of the best part of Franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It makes especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd to see the Matt Dillons Unterlippenbart of "Singles" shows whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is now felt like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">There are the moments chance to heat this fraction like a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" series, until he achieved as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene is to show the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"COMRADE Detective" to Amazon, a different kind of nostalgia: "The Americans," at the film "Atomic Blonde" and even at "GLOW" with its East against West Ringathlon Iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created his comedy with Rhys Thomas as a director, two officers of the eighties as friends, two officers from Bucharest, to fight for truth, Atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>

<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gig to see (the police brings the time to watch chess in television, how Americans are going to do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speaker - including Jenny Slate, Nick offerman, MahershalAli and Chloë Sevigny - ensures an independent game 'find the voice out'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "COMRADE Detective" is committed so much for the truthfulness of a branched propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a reagent mask is covered that it often plays a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There is a long episodes for six episodes, and the tragedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"COMRADE Detective," who became a lower length, could visit his Agitprop-Satire, since Gregor and Iosef is still the American embassy, whose lobby is still occupied by two dicken men that are scrapped by a bunch of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The embassy for the imaginated communist audience is that the Western culture can do everything for a vage.</seg>

<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I love me in love and made a special offer for this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet was completely overhauled completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a detachable layout - we had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne Stauraum and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, much light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "says it.</seg>

<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so the architectural challenge was on to create a mezzanine, where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative, to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms that they were stacked with each other, without that we had to move up.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It wasn't just to build a simple platform, but to put the steel that it had the correct height for the top or below. "</seg>

<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is around a garage.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering firm went in," explains Erfan of the stahlreinforced, furniated MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is mutually important, so that if you have the door of high, very light."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the CLEVERDE usage of space and storage room, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent is attached and a calculation based on the floor size. "</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and use high-quality materials that create the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch, and therefore help to create a emotional engagement in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into the electric sockets in walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">They are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment is characterized by a good design and increased square meterical value of something standard in something very astonishment.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the media origin of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and are failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, it will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to satisfy the information flow on President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a copy of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, he set up a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he would like to repair the wool: poor information that entered into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should be sent - whether on paper or in briefing - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waitish diagnostic makes sense, but others have attempts to monitor Trump to watch out his media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship for television is sufficient for decades - and now where he is in the White House, is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidates was offended because of a unfair report, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were convince," said the former electoral campaign Sam Nunberg in February opposite POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter spaties under control, according to six former electoral campaign to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a permanent lodge."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habits ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaigns know something that we don't know others - that Trumps Tweet does not contain any of the interventions even more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will never know something about the Tweet that Trump does not have sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff members knew it already some times, trouble of him will be rewarded with him, then their effort was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has to prevent it consistently causes that Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a willow house which turns out of concentering parties, trying to present their own agenda, giving up their own views from the world, possibly its views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - a whole story with this story - reported in May about the presidents of advisor, to introduce the president of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump-civil servants say that Trump can react as a volcano in negative press photos, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he could find out to find out of these things.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when somebody was accused of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, accused of his deputy Chief of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a bunch of Lecks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been missed due to schikes from Twitter, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he did not utterly utterly utterly in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees over Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmaker added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to manage a system to manage the paper, to manage the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it be folded?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebke, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors are still subject to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">This unchangeable factors revealing the Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. special investigators sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In Russia's affair around US President Donald Trump is supposed to have used a special investigator Robert Mueller after a report a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel has recorded the work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" under the job of confide.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper valued the step as a sign that mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The transmitter CNN reported that it is the first invitations of the Gremik in connection with a meeting between Trumps, oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us-secret services accuse the Kreml since longer, targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were speaking between Trumps Election team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to data, Mueller grew more and more trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post "wrote some weeks ago, that the special investigator was personally inaugurated in the centre for breaking up, if the President may detecting the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to prove to examine the evidence in possible breakdown cases and to decide whether it is charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore called evidence of evidence.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Generally, it is switched on if larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind locked doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel is also enabled by the Prosecution by people to detect individuals.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the transmitter CNN, already pre-invitations issued to turn around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked of a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps advisor and Schelderson Jared Kushner also took part in the conversation of Paul Manafort with the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on the Thursday night in the US television that the notion shows that Mueller is in his work not prostitute, and that he should be necessary to act as soon as it should be.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it's not necessarily called that the Grand Jury will be turned on the end to decide on the collection of an Indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the involvement of the Gremiums in the beginning of a new phase in the study and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new enthusiasts used the President of the Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia, to depict the Russia affair as campaign as campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia-history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic of democrats have a possibility to feel good, because they have nothing else but they can talk about it. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisors Ty Cobb declared a statement that he knows nothing of the composition of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">They don't work in secret that he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House feared all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator on "faire" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey have said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that it has changed anything, it was written in the explanation of the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only been used after Trump Comey had died.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this Rausage, preceding were against trump according to trump, he taught the judiciary for handicapped justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump made him a attitude of investigations against the former National Security Council of Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under large pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Following representation of U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special investigators and his staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculations about it, whether Trump Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike a independent special investigators of the Congress, like about in the Watergate monkey, Mueller made a position in which he could restrict a position in which he could restrict the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several Senators joined the parties to such a step, but preventing them.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and democratic Senators were dismissed on Thursday draft on Thursday, after which the special investigators could not be released.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Westantarktis, a gigantic iceberg was replaced by the barely seven-fold size of Berlins.</seg>
<seg id="1520">The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="1521">Situated over a trillion tonne of heavy, and 5800 square kilometres large coloss are going on to the north and will probably be two, three years until he had melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice huge, researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is a danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">In how far the climate change has played a role in the breaking of ice cream, is unclear after research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">For about 30 years, there has been a series of unusual collumps in the region, writing the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, that could be united with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken coloss had been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelike until now.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Smite weaker on the sea and is salted far from large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">So it grows further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelike is located south of South America nearly at the top of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfeises was the balance of quois and cancel some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelesss was there where AWI researcher writes Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot of evidence that the larsen-C stitches are in danger, because the front edge have never withdrawn from the right hand as at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate stood below tension and could be broken in case of a key number.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melt's melting and iceberg increases the level of sea level, since they swim on the water and ice as much water, as it yields right after the melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the building feises that the glaciers can descend directly to the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could increase sea level, but only in low dimensions, the British research project for observation of the Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelbrs is the fourth biggest shame of the Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">The transition from mainland is up to 700 metres thick, at the forefront to the free ocean some 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural way, and no direct connection to climate change is, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most recent retreat since the start of the records," he confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists be controversial if the Larsen-C-Schelcelebrate again, or may come together, possibly his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models tell that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researchers have not lead the cancellation of this gigantic ice cream in the past decade, so far as many ice skeles of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long gypsum of Antarctica extends toward South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the iron surface of the Antarctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">At the decline of the temperature rise, the temperature rise.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula have waited around three degrees in the past 50 years and counting the areas where the temperature is at the fastest lap.</seg>

<seg id="1562">The goal is to cover not only short-term conditions to meet professionals, but future-oriented candidates of application.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept was to view inside and outside, concrete measures for transitions show and a training offensive, require CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds already after a good approach.</seg>

<seg id="1816">There are threats, politicians, businessmen, businessmen, journalists who are suspected from the government of the government or the map, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no glory of violence, and throughout the country the bodies are frequent, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since the president Enrique Pena Nieto took part in December 2012. 589, after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their publishers and their inspirators of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest issue is to live in Mexico to be living in Mexico," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is recommended, although his presence is available - a large picture of Valdez, that shows his middle-finger on the front of the Riodoce building. two reporter in the three years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-Shirts, who will show his face of face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss its divided topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although in 2010, a special German Federal Government was built to assert the cases of journalists, according to the committee of journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, each year with threats and organized crime are linked, the murderer von journalists will only be rare before the court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce they still stand to treat violence of Sinaloa, although they are intrapped and even though the Terrain is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="1825">No information about the murderer, without justice, has the meeting for the discussion of security little benefits, Ibarra says.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, doing my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the why we know all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the country's capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a couple of blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was shot from his car and was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which was translated into the "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap continued in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours was added to Culiacan free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing in silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans was arrested in the last year and extradition in the United States in January, Zinaloa had become one of the bloody battlefields of the country, since rivalent fractions come here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It's nothing that can be shot in Sinaloa every day or more people on the streets, or that the graveyard is full of tinned, two-storey mausoleen for threats who are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forgot a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a card control of the coastal city with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Initially, in February the publication of a interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of a rivaled cartons in the war with Guzmans children.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have denied the sons, suspected gearing bought each copy of the output as soon as they delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was in it, Valdez not to zwingen, after the complaints of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a landmark in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived, that his friends and colleagues, that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as a experienced journalist for Noroeste, when he joined Riodoce in 2003 and sold 50 US dollars of shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without poison on the smoking case," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time, the newspaper served a reputation for the encourage and honest coverage, and revenue and advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it, hard treating investigations without fear of censorship, and the reader were fascinating, in which they could read stories that nobody couldn't handle anything else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot prize for its coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committees to the protection of journalists for its courage in the prosecution of the Mexican drug history, where they ever gone.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up to that he feared.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug market in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in the past October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take the task to take you as a journalist - either it or you play the Dumbbells.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do for so many dead... why didn't you say what went?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team measures Valdez, the Spawny, who could curse to the friend, who was generously with Umaries and counsel, a teacher who knew how to survived.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always sit to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, going on the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced to declare their own providers on the question how they can do their work on the best, and remain in life.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you don't like to move up with their wives, their children, their own shops, their own grid and runways, to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-staging and self-locking.</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincing trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, abb away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, said the Editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "Smell can be a mind that can be done... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and other say, apply in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggluten, weak institutions and corrupt government services.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff members of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly there were no cell phones. days before, Spyware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">In the shade of a tree made of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporter who belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who had instructed even as a trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been here, since the reporter went into the mountain landscape where the drug group facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has appeared on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to state spending that focused on the hometown of the Governors of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of state, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was kidnapped or as it was happened to write what everyone in the city knows that all of each in the city knows that the restaurant has a favourite place of drug merchants and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter of public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politician, who had instructed the governed Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled out all the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several PRI governors have been accused because of high-cardiac cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal bat the reporter of reporter of previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers voted the column of Valdez as the best informed source on the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier, we had already know what happened," says Villarreal, 46, with nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office, dedicated to a storage room for signs and sticker, dedicated to the Morde of journalists, because the staff have become something that they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez sappte a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration of an additional journalists to the Office of State Office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the Western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is.</seg>
<seg id="1890">By the whole country, journalists turned stronger by creating them in organized protests "SOS Press" in obediments and constructs.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez travels to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities, journalist and renew journalists because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has since has been asked since that by the government once again, because it is concerned that her Wut has injured their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crime, participated in the government officials and a equal society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporter could not only be killed by threats, but also on orders of politics and security forces, who used with the organized crime of a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group "Articulo 19" received more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants last year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, knowing that you want to hold the mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the moral have a terrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody got the death of the blogger Mary Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas in front of six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas samell: "here I am with my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">In addition to their separate head, a computer keyboard and headphones.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to conclude like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua, following the assassination of Corresponlava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others do well, like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo, after the assassination of their directors in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly announced the drug files with an editorial articles on the title page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries, or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile, and observe the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they will follow, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa who was assassinated in 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico City three months following the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risks decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, is that the drug retail was shot at him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I was reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was finished, the editors of Riodoce began on the office and drank beer, when all their phones started to Summen.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting paintings with Bandenrivalen and security forces near the Mazatlan had 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued, as it was promised by a number of Kartell Embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the border stone, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens boiled near - a further shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who thought to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">When they were afraid, they did not show them.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Among the mighty portrait of the fallen founding of the newspaper, whose Middlefinger for quite Sinaloa was visible, followed by Riodoce his traces.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you think about it," said Bojorquez, "when at the same day, at the same day, internship was murdered by Javier, the internship will be asked to send them to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to soak his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">It looks like a statue that looks like a statue, like a statue, like a statue.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now researchers have found that the first insights of an amazing miners of a Canadian miners so well received that experts were described as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that it could even be found that his elderly skin of reddish brown was - and they said they would have something from a "Unquiet past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report published in the magazine "Current Biology" called him as "the retained armoured dinosaurs who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurs that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievably well preserved condition, researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable" to describe.</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armoured plant will be the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was flaked off the surrounding cliffs, decided to look more detail from the surrounding cliffs.</seg>
<seg id="1932">Founded by him Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years, the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all these hard work, the ready result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you have a little with the eyes blind, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main poet Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will come to the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-held dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosauriere."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant fresser, although it is covered with a divider and resembles the breembles, probably from meat dumper dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strong armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before crab, and used an screenings, which is used as a counter, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix well into its environment and to soak his enemies, experts, what indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs has made headlines and is now shown in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in May.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studying the wild animal and it's Borealopelta marketselli after the Museumsteekeeker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, which document the design and the form of sheds and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the tapered shaded, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the peak of the creature darker was as their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the console is common, the results will be surprisingly, because the size of Borealopelta has exceeded the living animals today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs caused by enough pressure by meat to dinosaurs that evolution of evolution of the confrontation as an average of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of contemporary animals allowed to use the tapered shaded - are much smaller and violated as prey, what signals that this Nodosaurs had been exposed to a real struggle.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carrot behavior on a massive, strong armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have been to have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the dinosaural ravel brown was.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on critics on its life, including his conservative loans to find out what it has eaten than its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was driven out into a river and cast into the sea where he decreased on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time, Alberta was so warm like South florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably widespread landward as they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable, because he is covered completely with the conservative-less skin, but also in three dimensions remains, and the original shape of the animal is beholding," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the Tier today looks almost the same as in the early delivery period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">They don't need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you are just a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is in sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The delivery time was a time when huge thermal odes, fleshly monosaural, which arose on two legs, the earth is gone through.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaurs were arrested by some of his furchwarding ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This one is one of the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy duty.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The researchers, their latest insights in the journal Current Biology revealed that Borealopelta was transferred to the death in the sea and disbanded in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the beast preserved dinosaurs in the world, including skin and turkey, and is complete from the snout to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It included two 20-inch long tips that ragged by its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant fresser was kindled by the Western Canada, until a flooded river it flowed into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater type of the dinosaural rewarmed his arms in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The stonewed remains of this special, so well preserved that the Hautreste still cover the pricing plates along the dinosaural</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko written for National Geographic, is such a level of conservation so 'rarely like a profit in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the better render it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Stonewed residual of the skin still cover the holpriceless plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right foot is laid on its side, his five fingers are bent to the top.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the sheds on his sole. '</seg>
<seg id="1971">Thunderstorm: Massenkarbobolster on A8: many wounded</seg>
<seg id="1972">Severe accident on Thursday evening at the A8: almost 30 vehicles were delayed in a mass storage amboam.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous injured, kilometersland Staus - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the late Thursdays of the Stuttgart-Munich (A8), some 20 people were injured during the late morning afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first data of the police at 17.00 o'clock between the connection place Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a gewitters almost 30 vehicles, including probably lorries, inconversed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">No information on the exact number of injuries initially no data.</seg>
<seg id="1977">In order to handle moderate to medium injuries, a pollinist preached.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A great surveyed to rescue service was on the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in direction Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometer long return station was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like a AZ-reporter, there came also on the backslide for a massive disabilities - by numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade notched the license number of the vehicle directing, which now have to count with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Just after 18: 45 it was still a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">It was a collision between a Autotrania and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A bailer helicopter was on the road to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testet "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It's a moment that has experienced almost everyone once: nothing doubly sitteth in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work, and has just a brilliant thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: pufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the Schaffner, and weds an unsets, or walketh the rest in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Monitoring control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are coming soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn currently test the main attractless guide services.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirms the mobile phone that one should be taken and removes the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">At present, a test run on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"the offer is coming, wide we offer.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It is expected to be available in the beginning of next year on many other long distance routes in Germany, "said one way.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"Comfort check-in" is called the train card overall with Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">To use it, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a Smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to booked an online ticket - what you do already have to do most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have the app the DB Navigator, what kind of it is the easiest way of the box.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last one needs a seating reserving.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The "Comfort Check-in" works so: it moves up into the train, calls his ticket under "My tickets".</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic validation appears in the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The access to their mobile devices are a message that Fahrgast X is located in the train and has taken the drugging seat place Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train conductor on number Y white he knows that there is a passenger with previously prepared online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to continue, continue to keep silence.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for rail - which is to take advantage of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who doesn't want to travel without a ticket control via our train ticket, check out in the DB navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables the passengers to create their travel time in the train personal trip, "says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who are often travels, knows that besides delays and missed trains, the map controls one of the biggest doctors.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, one of the passengers should not take all documents in any case, but you will need to obtain online tickets online.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the number of personnel is missing or else a document that must be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between train and rides, which leads to worse mood in the part or large room and delays at the end of its own tickets and the Schaffner takes over the time to take care of others.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Nor can only use a small number of test customers the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that is also on the connections of the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further access numbers on the same way are not unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">In August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot up to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after they arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis praises on the bed of an Airbnb-flat which they rent and scrollers through Facebook to their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumble over a post by someone from the High School.</seg>

<seg id="2024">Confused by no one else she had posted the information on her Feed, she finished Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly offering at their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an armed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body, which was stretched out on the street and remain there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell cared for himself.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But it was death for her and her fellowship.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She turned their mobile phone to return on the evening to Tweet over people on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police tape and people who cried out, and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>

<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, was a different policeman and cried, saying, "I will kill you..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," I remembered her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed ourselves and we can call it typically."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt Schüttelfrost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was mad and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a trip, went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year old daughter from her father's house and decided to drive the two next morning to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary movie "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of surviving and of protest, the strength and power of resistance, which consists of the point of people living in the community and the streets were filled to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As a Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a vase-dress and a right crown carried out after Ferguson, discuss the two of a conversation which they had countless times in this morning "over the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, how I have taught you when black people must go for war, what they believe?" remembered that which she said.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and it wasn't really true.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I couldn't take them away, "he said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">They must know it and see it on it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well designed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I was lucky enough to give you an experience with which they do not have any ective racism, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I've got the feeling I would have a bad service to keep them away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when she arrived at Ferguson, located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was granted to a camp on the possible non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There were Ferrell and her daughter with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and made them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started a new type of activism for Ferrell's appearance.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my stock vism has changed after 9 August total," she said, "she said that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Russian Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health precedoms in black congregations.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come here. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met during a evening demonstration in Sabaah Folayan, a co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Follow-up, she said, her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came from Ferrell in the sense: "will you be documented or trying to find a story that you can utilize it?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This Skepsis was nourished by countless cases of people, often from willows - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated on an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices have not centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already worked with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that rum also known for his activism by Todestract.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment, Ferrell brought the project closer together with six other deposits followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years to Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not anyone who speaks for us, or talking about us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me as those people are depicted, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The target was not to focus on ferrells experience - to show that it is not a Messias guide, but for a community that come together, "said Folayan - she proved to be revealed as the manifest participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a consequence, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly, personal aspects of ferrells live, as she loves and married her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," I said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I agree that it must have a certain injury in this work with the dehumane of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells story repeated the role of the black swimmers women in the broader black-lives-matter motion.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of movement, who discovered the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012, identify the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as a weak.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, weak women in leadership positions have borne the movement," said Ferrell, "and so we are fighting in different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, weak women must bear the main last of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan voted to note that "the movement of the black women and many black women are kept growing."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it is however, that "this is no affirative type of action," at the Ferrell's identity as the heart of the film was selected.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who raised this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although she was in front of the front man because of a life at these cruisations as a black, a weak woman so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racite links between the congregation and the police continue.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is for 2 ½ years due to blocking the highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social-magical atmosphere of the area that they call her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nonetheless they were clambled at a vocal and she feels like this memorial, since then she went over three years ago in Ferguson on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our obligation to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our obligation to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love one another and support.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">Coming from "dream" to "size wahn": TV-Reader discuss through bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The Bit Gallery moved people, although they are still not built for long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the southern part of the pedestrian zone has been obsolete since the first presentation in 2009 the population in Bears and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold lets the topic hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While one of the bit gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real" (Nicole Schausten), coming from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi]) or quite a light: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While it feared to build a gallery more clients across the city, of which the other stores are benefiting, fear the opponent's pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned in exactly on the property, in which the farmhouses will offer their products in the 13 direct markings.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction, it will be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie Macher want to integrate a market place in the new building, and to the Beda square with a possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we've been at a time in the farmhouse market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the country are always very pleased.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butchers for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish us, even during and especially after construction of the gallery there is a chance to get up this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There is also that in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if direct markers at a market hall in the gallery, comes on the height of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The same is probably not low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the shopping basket in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether Clothing, shoes, Droma- or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many charges are empty here - some have been working here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But there's not a regular weekly market, it is more important that at least the Markthalle remains at least.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all the service of the service is fresh, mostly the product of the product is offered directly from the product, and is obended in inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop booklets are hired in a shopping centre only of larger companies because the dorms are often not portable for one retailers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Shame, special stores there are almost no more and that which is still left, will probably be vanish. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the Gallery is not according to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the peasant markthalle during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in duration if the bit of bit is actually actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or creates it to be the Gespenst Bit Gallery in advance, all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just will not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">After my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer market place, it is no longer thanks to the awesome game, like I find - senselless building projects in Bitburg no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmhouse is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost impossible to impose them on the ceiling of the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-tubes and hairstyle, which were sent to Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analytics had a 35-year prison sentence after she made public diplomatic messages about the VikiLeak website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years Correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline is their professional competence in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a wife and dissidetent dissidine, whose assessment of Barack Obama was converted, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which was extracted from the 30 portraits, such as any intellectual property, not only to the formability of DNA data - the many wise men, and the toughest deterioration of these interpretations - but also created to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward born in 2013, but has been sentenced to 20 charges since their puberty, including six violations against the Spionagegesetz, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison was her picture, so much that there was only a single photograph - a grainy color, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is clearly sitting on a driver's seat and an platinblonde is spears - associated with it was also associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of their 2012 project "Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist portraits of foreigners from forenical artefacts like cigarette lightends and chewing gum that extracted the DNA from the waste, to produce a picture of which people may look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in jail, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany that article, Dewey-Hagborg declared a press preview for the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit at this time and could not be photographed, therefore, you took contact with Chelsea, and asked them if they wanted a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">In the course of two years, the artist and their inadmissions were killed, who intervexed several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even had a copy of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic "Suppressed images" who would locate a future in which the President Chelseas sentence would be to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama has actually only a few days after the book was released, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of lucky gathering.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There are also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep, and Starkes, da Donald Trump leads an war against informant from the government camp and against transgender forces to raise new, tweetable ways to move forward, further to flaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg originated after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of contemporary artistic statements, creing with her surplus description of them (the "i" in her family names) is an end of the "automatic crash, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg trusted, through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), how amazing similar to at least in biological sight, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people are hopefully to take care for our genome that we are, and how open-genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a own room, is one side from the above mentioned comic Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as it came up with a free prediction in the hand from the disciplinary Caucasins of the United States as King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they set up your speech, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so will never be the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," said the artist who greet from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get a geese, if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition not personally - as it was supposed to be taken in the comic book - but when they should do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of masks, of their own genomic simulations, that are related to hordes of Protestants.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted as everything is written in the exhibition until the size (5 "2," Mannings Stature), where their genetic hastrology was written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a man's crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel it like a mass movement, which was formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a Comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was a slider hole for Margaret Thatcher in 1970-he and 1980-er.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his homely seat in the Cll River valley in Kent, and is now to inspiration for a graphical novel of Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a forelove for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so nice to look forward to the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years," says he weary. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'scanned the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's TEETH and Other Stories, "a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpected emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I just responded to the Daughter print on the page of a letter, which was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters called upon smoke, because then there was a fire in the light of light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has a effect when he himself did.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Ah, I love Archive! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England, and almost four months in a castle lived ("To be honestly, I seem to be a little over,") seems to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days that the viktorian "new" chateau to study the archives and the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monary hypocrates of walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the Graben.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated by the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with Landscapes, gardenies, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then he drank of "Whiskey and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only received full access in 2006 when the last Eram, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">As a Rhodes a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive began to take care of the archive that he was "hundreds of years, in which AristotDemocrats," Oh, wirf it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps, which represent: "it could be boring that land conflicts could be boring," says rhodes, "but there was a birch to meet the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all his aisle! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection will use the castle as a starting point to spread on a wider basis into English history, including 'The Labourer', who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a recording of an uproar which appeared in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant began in this area and I thought, a uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps are the two connected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are confiscated in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which is the story of the Jesuit's history, representing the family Darrell seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', shown in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell carved out of the 18th century, who filled his own burial site by adding a Sarg with stones (a discovery which was only done until the year later when his Sarg was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen to be couring Gauner, always make debts and money for things that they cannot afford themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men stains their debt crisis by pressing a rich old women in marriage - I set it to me as a bunch of a good looking young guys, with a talent to get landmarks. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of its service in the castle Rhodes on the search for other unique cry experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish game for a comic novel about Elhanänmonki, the area of a Sanatoriums from the early 20th century, which has once again returned from nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney got him a special place.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go again," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like: "Oh, now I have to be ready again with the damn life."</seg>
<seg id="2323">Campaign launched: about 300 years old Mariubelle in Rhöndorf cover</seg>
<seg id="2324">With the closure of the 301-year-old daughter in Rhöndorf, the City of Bad Honnef has launched her campaign to launch a new roof stamp (Rundschau of Thursday).</seg>

<seg id="2350">On the day after the coup had called Erdogan attempt to overthrow the masturgeon, as he gave him the opportunity to make the armed forces "completely clean."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But did Erdogan really really in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet published an article with the heading" Unbalances in the military headquarters. "</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the General Staff of the Chief of "Islamists" of an increasing "Islamists" of the Army, who manifested in among others, in the raising of the scalability for solo manifesters, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The major guards in the army and security forces go further.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan sent a further 7395 Staatsdiener, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed to be narrowed as the Erdogan in the Military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals paid earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three. putsches them under appeal to their role as guards of the world leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan moved the power to power to step by step, not in appeal to the reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers, Erdogan is aimed specifically to fight Islamic forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the "Vocal Europe" in the magazine "Vocal Europe" warned a prominent officer who, after the coup attempt by persecution from abroad, seeking the Turkish army in a few years, "full of extremists and Salafists."</seg>

<seg id="2379">This sum will take 75 percent over the country.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The Ascent of sex-robots is real, and we should worry about us</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it will not be crazy about that 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the range of sex-robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-Robot are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex-robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus of the Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, select its form of breast milk and type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people imagine a funny, but the company deliver any amount of it, and we will have much more common to see," said Mr Sharkey at the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexupuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone gel that can be warm, with conscious human reactions, which will be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also fit its robots in accordance with its convictions, "and you can choose from the eye of the robot on the form of breast arms up to the type or the color of his fingerns.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still troubled when many robots have the "personalities" that would have a gazford-wife progressive appearance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexupuppen have developed into robots with a silicone retina.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix-Robot allows for example to adjust its users to adapt their robot to the properties like for example sober.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roof True Companion developed by True Companion's sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," with the impression of sober attacks and "wild Wendy" with a "abadventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," sware the site of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So you like what you like, and they don't like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It has also in the course of day, you also have their voices - quite as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">You can be tired to be fixed on conversational, or it can be "in mood"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many troubled aspects on this ascension of sex-robbers - not least because they replacing human relationships - but the subordinarily female properties that is appearing on frigid (the name here: contrasting) Farrah is added, unserene a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a VIBRATOR, but for males.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a VIBRATOR, why can men do not have any Roof?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex-robots are not only a fetish or just another sex play.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing Raffinesse show some darker and lowering of our culture, on a return of the ideal of equality of sexes to a desire to sex with submission as optional allowance.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men do not eat any sex-robots, while the FRR will increase their increasing popularity, however, they still remain on the edge of the consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what inspired by the Random zones that we can live in relation to the Spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or satisfactorily, until them the free market have been used for approval.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain conviction that these highly developed sex-robots in a time that are threatened with women worldwide, in which the rights of women are threatened to have an President that has grown in the White House, who attacked women to sexual violence.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horror aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images that affects the swimmed body, but as realistic these vision.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind this sex robot is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also using Pornostar Proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builder want to feel decent man to imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, if it is about their "personalities," the robots represent no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separate from their companions or simply away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They don't have a mediation or background history, nothing, what about independence or anything indicates that the imagination of the imagination may be interference.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Differently, you are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to press it in 2017, press: services</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to protect the healthy human understanding?</seg>
<seg id="2426">It's become a binge time of the trump era that have decided to have the US voters that have chosen US voters, even families in small scale.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around the Christmas and Erntedankfest existed in the USA newspapers with advice about how to render the horror of Trump transformation relations.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We felt all supposedly on to leave our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notices has been the power of Trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a linksary poet, who has lived in Chicago, has been living in New York since langem with the Republicans in our family.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They remembered that the unity of a common enemy can have a mighty effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican relationship, with which it had fighting for decades due to politics, suddenly and very strange at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to take the dining table, this is certainly a good cause, but it falls in a further context that it brings considerable risk with itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The Left was strengthened by Trump, but the effect of his presidency has the force to move forward to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the cruel opportunity that we will not be able to cast us out of a day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is yet another long-term scenario in the trump Republicans of the right wing "normalised," which appears to appear in comparison to its standards as inset of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find it nowadays of a active nostalgia for Mitt's funny version of the retracting - the dog on the car roof, which saw 14% income taxes (but at least knew we know how his tax returns) - which both occur in comparison to trump in fact a very mild offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy, to qualify as unreadable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to Karusel in Central Park, the largest of the carouses of New York parking department, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city when you need a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses have enormously large, fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all Clowns are crying and the animals turning to look at full of fearing over their own shoulders - extremely fining and the klimmering music also acts as well as a notable fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappointing to the views of high buildings, the Skylines are to offer to offer plenty of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be righteous.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five-five years later, and I still had not yet over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the subject-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of Londons.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, Central Park-Karussell is still a strange experience, as there are two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40's and all of them have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I have been able to evaluate the carousel, I would have given to him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked later.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same to balance the option with a 15% tip to balance - this to buy something about the Ladder.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This leads not only to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerting pressure on the server to put personality into a situation, which is not necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2490">Software Update for diesel vehicles: what do you need to know now</seg>
<seg id="2491">How accurate is the software update?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel-driver have to participate in the action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The main questions and answers in the overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are to improve the exhaust behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and sometimes Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or bad are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe is assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action obligatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the booked software updates are voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the obligatory updates only apply to the vehicles that include Schumann software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The retrofitting has ordered the KRAFTFAHRT (KBA) (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and from where are customers informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturer have announced a generous implementation in the next months, but still called no exact date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has informed, each actualization.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If it is due to an inspection, this will be done in their frame.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long does the need to go up?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"difficult to say," weep Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The curtains of the manufacturer of the manufacturer, as well as the political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen, voluntarily negotiated the auto producer for the environment until now."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long does the update should last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The conversion itself could last for 3 to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Timbers could be there, an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do car driver that have no car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE will wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Presumably would the foreign manufacturer would go, so Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is now a massive price of Euro-4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE will be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But in the regions where driving conditions are threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2519">In rural space there has no impairment losses for older diesel.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs city building, dates back to Rente next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - suitable applicants are rar.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For 31 years, Wacker Stadtbaumeister.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun, as he will publish in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports varied, but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, however, it's no application to fill the challenging profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for the next possible time a architects or design engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So, - below the regular cancellation of the cancellation - still enough time for a lonelaboration.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach for the administration of administration as a substitute judge, the applicant must prescribed the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city on each case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they cannot fill out this, they would have to drive the citizens to Offenburg until Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the inhabitants of the city and himself is important, Wacker says of a good operating climate, as well as good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In over 30 years, some important projects have accumulated, based on the Wacker with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city vivid," he is over the building site and his employees safe.</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla Areas and the Netherlands-car park.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium is still subject.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros a beech, "if we make it right," estimates Wacker.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all wait great tasks on my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design have been present for a city expansion in large game room.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslachs, own building yard and gardennerei could be flexibly reacted on multiple properties.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," so Wacker, and the design of the green consoles are often mentioned by citizens and visitors often.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town is under monuments, it is important to have one eye for this, what it fits, if new building has been approved, stressed the separating city master.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Sohnehin is wearing high responsibilities in the citymaster.</seg>
<seg id="2559">It is Bauherr, "at the end all this is running on my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">For care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been working with Manfred Schöner (drenbau) for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Even so that his successor remains long, Wacker: "we are looking for someone who would really be identified with the spot."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Who would like to know who like Roland Wacker would like to provide information about the town of Haslach, a graduate studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with specialist architecture in the areas of construction and construction law.</seg>
<seg id="2564">Planning and civil engineering, building planning, Grunderwerage matters, administration of urban songs, urban operating courtyard with building yard and municipal building (including membranes, including membranes, including membranes).</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bicycle on pipes: southern route closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, so far, the blue bike was thrown by the track track in the Leoge road (B116) on the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so strongly damaged that the downturn of freight had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and search for night hours after them.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the Tatort was witnesses to a rosaroter runners and a bike driver had been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"that goes beyond a Lausbubenstein," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA.</seg>
<seg id="2571">The perpetrators, or the perpetrators are killed himself in big risk and also endangered the train.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition to the damage to the loco and plant, as well as the late-minute drive and the cost of rail products could also come to the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">In total, a total of "significant" sum, said the speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damages were fixed at the Friday afternoon, the railway bridge could be led without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Almost ten motorists were out again, two of which concerned the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight charges did not fly, however, they had delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to the ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch had to be exchanged around 200 metres of upper lines.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (flammable representations) to lindern</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can be used for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with adorable representations left.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The healed state, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300,000, causes magicians and bloodings, recurring or bloody accidents, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the affected usually, meat and dairy products to prevent their symptoms, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins, develop immunotherapy, develop a tolerant loan.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the Darm patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in the body, not into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are imperforated, inflammation are inflamed of cells, protecting the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is toward inflammation, it may cause an anti-inflammation result.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments this species was determined that a kind of tolerance promoting immunotherapy in mice, which apply a certain bacterium in their initiatives.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between bacterial-species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioms, and the development of a population of cells which promote the tolerance is made.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan ever had the mice in their food, the more they had them from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less flammable militus if the same system also confusion.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postpontorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan searched a kind of immune cell that had found the tolerance that a group of study maids such cells had, but a different group of the same tribe that was separated, but had not been hooked.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference of the intestinal microbial of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, normally live in the stomach's intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice were found DNA sequence and were found six bacterial types that were in mice with the immune cells, but without these were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were mounted in a sterile environment, so that them was lacked a certain microbiome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. cruciteri and the immunotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria had grown to the immune system, the researchers seized the crucifixes in a liquid and then reduced the small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria, and they were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immunotherapy developed on the tolerance of tolerance cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As an active component of the liquid has been cleansed, it proved to be regarded as a secondary product of tryptophan metabolism, which is known as indol 3 dairy acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers examined the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us crucifixes in our stomach crossings.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-side-products from L. cruciteri have been such as mice, but defects in Genes in relation to tryptophan people were found in people with adorable representations.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells probably is something that we want to promote, because these cells are inflammation on the internal surface of Darms.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to a extent of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2605">In Manchester United has signed a "genius" by Nemanja Matic, "says Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder he had his debut against Sampdoria.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Matic was excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of blues, and managed only 45 minutes, which had to improve Mourinho, that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League-season.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the kind, such as he thinks - he think football," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"we will help him to be ready later than later."</seg>
<seg id="2610">In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku died in the Aviva stadium when Mourinho began his start-XI for the beginning of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The Independent revealed that Mourinho still wish three more new boarding money, but he's insisted that the club had already performed a "fantastic work", three of his four priority ship.</seg>

<seg id="2613">"I will be happy if they get four of four, but they have given great effort."</seg>

<seg id="2622">New drenschlag for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As the wind of the wind revolves, as Sigmar Gabriel still had the SPD head, an Socialist and democratic minister presidents are always with a certain concern after Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Only no interfeuer out of the party central, just no headwind from the federal government - so loud as the principal desire of the suffers.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz has led the party, has changed considerably.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, members from the Willy-Brandt house has since then conducting the events in the SPD governed state capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">Since the beginning of the year, what Schulz have been given since the beginning of the year, he would not be described in the way.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were deep places.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="2630">The Bundes-CDU looks after the end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"it shows a bit more: red-green, simply governed no excitly," said CDU-General Peter Tauber, the Editor network Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising confraction of a Green MEPs, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) was overthrown into a severe crisis by the Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD).</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the landing, his red-green Coalition lost their An-voices majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green BundesManaging Director Michael Keller has urged the disrupted Lower Saxony-MPs Elke Tweeter to return to their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The overjoins to CDU means a clear slidesires of voters.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Tweeter must immediately return to their mandate, "said the Federal Office and Election Head of Economic Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"that may all not be true, there is a SPD electoral campaign, when the new Hiobsbotanist has reached the party centre on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands under the remains of the green MPs Tweeter to CDU without their own government.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional highlight of a whole range of large and small crises in the SPD Land.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what next comes.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Misere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more not, soothing the genuous time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Everything will be different from the shore elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia.</seg>
<seg id="2644">This was then too - and in fact everything is much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a routing, the Düsseldorf-Plein haute facing the party.</seg>
<seg id="2646">During the weeks, the comrades got up again in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when she had a new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came to the next draft.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Landeschef, lost his Nimbus, because he sat in the Elbphilharmony while his city burnt down.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he continued in the crunch communications thereafter quite anything wrong, what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Ever since then, Scholz was fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So also Stephan Weil still now.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW-exhaust gas and its role in the supervisory board of the Anglo-Saxon Prime Minister had already been in the criticism.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese Refresh values came added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or maybe just why, Weil tried to set up over the last weeks in the bunch of Akzente.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The foremost of the former civil master from Hanover, power to build his power in Berlin, also stayed comrades in category Martin Schulz will not be hidden.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They forwarned him, since they spoke of Weil a stabilization of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now, the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">In this morning, Weil is due to the partnity of the Lower Greens Parents no guilt.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz are not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">Insert the comrades in order to keep their own rows closed.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Your wrath is aimed at the Greens, and here especially on the backsliding parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it's indefinitely and democracies, such as Mrs. Tweest their own career at the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of the party in the SPD Bundestag in the German Social Forum, Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Ms. Twesten is not elected until its person as direct didatas, but on the state list of the Lower Greens Parliamentary Assembly was elected in Parliament, so the Saxon Chamber of Deputies.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that her mandate is returned.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thomas Oppermann, Chief of the SPD Federal Parliament, proclaim a "undemocratic maneuver."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the voters of four years ago was clear: the people have done Stephan Weil as the Minister of Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the lower-Saxon SPD as the top of the parliamentary elections, the RND.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"now, the personal career of a future CDU member will result," said Oppermann. "</seg>
<seg id="2669">He asked the backgrounds to clarify.</seg>
<seg id="2670">I want to know if there is more or more continuous support of CDU Niedersachsen.</seg>
<seg id="2671">Conveyors of Ortisers III</seg>
<seg id="2672">Who wants to leave his house within the years, can be coming from the country for coming soon.</seg>
<seg id="2673">About this, the mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEC city development began on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler had once again a review of the date.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been able to discuss it in the emptying areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the conservation area of I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the audience was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler the previous sanctions is a "successful project" - it was finally important to promote the internal development, and not only new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, you will receive information from the meeting in Karlsruhe, where it will give it a sanitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total amount amounts to 833 333, of which 500 000 Euro come from the country, the remainder of the commune began.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a sanitation area?</seg>
<seg id="2682">One will continue to examine so Schindler continue, examine where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it plays also a role whether in the planned area at all interest consist of interest.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In any case, the territory could also be posthumed again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The STEC Trust on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Cellars presented the content of the federal states "program" Social city, "whose frame would be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program are the revitalization of inner city, improving the living and working conditions and delivery of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be objection, that is per plot per property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Finally, the sanitation area was finally established as a statutes.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The authorization period for funding has been running since January 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026.</seg>

<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domagatzen were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high levels of excessibility, 67 Domagatzen are sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "summarized that the domicellmeister R. in many cases were applied physically and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">At high emotion, the punishment of the pupils could also be fiered for students.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nonetheless, contrary to many other accuses, many victims were estimated the general crimes of R. estimated and therefore, in numerous cases even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hesemann, the final report of the Mississisal, explains the final report to the Deensburger Dommock Georg Ratzinger of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report about the "incidents of violence to protection against the Regensburger Domagatzen" is a contradictory picture of Domellellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">He will raise many students his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other, it appears also known as cholesterol and perfectist, which was far more prominent when an DomSpatz had no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you do than its biograph this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and reads the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one must be wondering why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">In him just eight pages are dedicated, and he is acquainted clearly by any suspicion of economic or mitigence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Violent actions are also reflected in the preschool, outside of its effects.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It can rebuke him if too late, too late or first suggestions couldn't be taken enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The cathedral moist grammar school, which he worked from practically all respondents than - so literal - "redemption," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">So also the wide majority of his student Georg Ratzinger is a very excellent bear witness, "" "" "" "" competent, "" competent "," competent, "competent," competent, "competent, and" always in the grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only one minority is described above his PERFECTIONISM and its high emotion, who also led to Wutausages.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he is not only knocked out with the keys and the key bund on the ground, but also earliest boys to the hair or ears, he had already admitted himself already before years, too deep and excuses.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, in his honour of honour must be said, however, such salvation methods in the unquestionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, widely used, with parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us, who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have experienced that even in a worldwide school, a state school of a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually in this report, namely, the deposition of sexual abuse and nonviolence at the preschool, the nauilich Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">As we ask, whether it doesn't have to do with his acquittness and his role as brother of Benedikt XVI. many media has straight on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">The Bavarian Pope, however, works many that never understood him, even more eifrig.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report was determined by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot about the topic abuse of abuse in the Domensburger Domotatzen was reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will also use any destruction or conscience in terms of sexual abuse in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victim of sexual interventions claimed to have already familiar to the Domotellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never geted my father, my father or mother," said one of the people, "I told me all very handy."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the declaration of sexual abuse and is that most victims from shame will be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not commit their parents and siblings, then surely not a choral manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How to evaluate the domain Shia Student Ratzingers Role with regard to the Missing accidents?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated like this: "concerning sexual abuse... no case, in which he calculated (Georg Ratzinger) would have had to have been able to have had been able to stop and had the respective activity.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I keep it... also for really absurd to assume that it is calculated... buben inflated or clearer or even more, than opposite to their parents, Internet leaders, confidentials etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">This report also comes to the very clear result: "that, in the field of affected students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger thus reach of all of them.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be rejected, it cannot be avoided or put it to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good names with these reluent crime in connection, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was much of "violence against" violence to the Domensburger Domotatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be indicted in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this preview?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in the coverage of all missed and prevailed in a giant melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and anywhere, in the midst of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly that is again a misuse of reports.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Then it is clean separated: between the preschool and high school of the Domotatzen, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as, we say once, other courts.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, a report from the period since 1945, i.e. from four decades, Georg Ratzinger wasn't choral director of the Domotatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test Pedagogy, the cases, in which the boys were lawful and scenic, and including terrible, allesamt of the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really skandalous states have to have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those who had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the cathedral moist grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On it was how the most witnesses emphasize the theme "Preschool" Tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be cancelled and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "parawegian" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the cathedral-atzengymnal?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but there is no acidic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, with the report to the conclusion that "many victims were estimated the general call of R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at the most, the prediction shall be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, in spite of all efforts, the report was defined only two periods which was reported to him from the circumstances on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and had not been responsible for the processes at a school which he had not really worked and responsible, (so the witness) would not hear, and then only in 1993 again.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger decided in front of the circumstances, the ears of the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-atzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this way, he demonstrates this way, "that in the preschool we will still practised the test."</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the risk of negative press reports, he was strongly screened.</seg>
<seg id="2966">It was of course at a time when legal clarity was prohibited as testing punishments in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, she looked at a right greyzone, like everyone from us are still white.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also hard to complete for him, where the people were perhaps aggerated or dramatic, and where really the permitted limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it can't say that he would have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test penalty was abolished in Bavaria in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis acknowledged that it was unfair to use today's pedagogical standards at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking of historian of "Fallstrick of Anachronism," which is the danger, past to present day moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the principality has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true for sexual abuse, who was fired at all times, and not for that which was interrupted in preschool and violence against innocent children, which goes beyond the back then.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all awful and I'm glad that it is finally opened.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its funds for disciplinary and punishment, so earning and ears to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When the body's punishment he was forbidden, he has also been stripped.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the picture of his raensburger time Georg Ratzinger said to the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic Tests also in language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: now, in the book the life of his brother Joseph, says Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, since they played the domination only a secondary part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I knew that there was a strictly raiment to be there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also that must be said once again: without these PERFECTIONISMUS, without creating unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible from the nationwide known regimen of Europe and his musical tradition that went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and Bonbons alone, one makes no great singers and before every success, right in which area, still discipline, passion, and self overcomes.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What a man have you experienced for a man by Georg Ratzinger at the talks of her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: from the work on the book and in addition, I experienced Georg Ratzinger really very well known and repeatedly seen as a wonderful, humorous and warm people, of whom you cannot imagine that he could only allow a fly something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'm waiting regularly with how many former DomÃ atzen are still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly visit him to visit him, he is almost blind - and it is as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him to today that he had strictly too close to them, so is the minority in minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domestic atzen are thankful to him today, that he enriched their lives and brought them the world of the music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always is a good wealthy teacher - a strenger father, unite, that may be, but also a lovable respectectson, who still had to look at it, and honour her.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And yet again, all of you know what to happen to him, are experiencing methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have been running this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is very unjust, a man, only because he is prominent and one more prominent brother, to make the medial sinners.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands in behind, just too obviously.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report which has just been published, lastimated him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the cultivated area would have acquired a 93-year-old man who has acquired major merits and without the outside of Bayerns, and perhaps Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domagatzen in Germany.</seg>
