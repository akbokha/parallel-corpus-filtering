Gol@@ fer Lang@@ er gives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are out@@ lined .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er , with some colleagues a bit tor@@ rent with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere in the 58 @-@ year @-@ olds .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport p@@ ile &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after some minutes the horses remember@@ ed her holiday , they hunt for the fast g@@ allo@@ ping home .
a kilometer at this temp@@ o , I have dre@@ ar .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and thus the horse career finally ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer in all times - 101 Tournament - again near horses .
he left himself with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , he sw@@ ore to a horse on a horse .
it was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was conv@@ inc@@ ing .
the German sports aid survi@@ ving the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small g@@ ala p@@ ile pyramid .
in distinc@@ tions it does not include the symp@@ ath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Federal Constitution , silver bay leaf , champ@@ ions @-@ tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already felt him .
the 18th Lau@@ re@@ ate of the Sport p@@ iles marked .
in Aachen , he met on Saturday the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler .
&quot; this award is much too much , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; because they will not only give for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social eng@@ agement . &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er promot@@ es the off@@ spring .
and so he was also the money prize of 25,000 euros .
with 15 more important sport@@ s@@ ors , the two @-@ time Master@@ class winner was recorded in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
among the out@@ ings include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schm@@ itt , who kno@@ ck Eberhard Gi@@ enger , the fai@@ ries Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schm@@ itt , der Jud@@ ok@@ a Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , der Spr@@ ite An@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and post@@ h@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard Wonder@@ fully .
many of these sport@@ s@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday after Aachen .
following the official part , the illustr@@ ate company went into the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azz@@ a prize was running .
Bernhard Lang@@ er held clearance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and invest the trade agreement TT@@ P - that would like to provide both Clinton as well as tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential statements are however , however , in terms of tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s differences between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a bas@@ ically important philos@@ oph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the dou@@ b@@ ts rather small and war@@ ns before the state of the economy can har@@ m - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton to reduce death and regul@@ ate economy , he says .
however , it would be quite different , claimed tr@@ ump .
it will return controllers in solid , and he makes for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to ful@@ fil , he has dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous opportunities and needs money .
that is why the tax would increase if the rich man would say .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the m@@ uts we will say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ ries .
the Democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classical and democratic policies and are rejected by the nation@@ wide Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so that dump might still be taken into internal discussions .
the differences in the energy and climate policy are clear .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and return coal transport in the USA again .
oil spon@@ sor@@ ship will also be possible to be able to canc@@ el the Paris climate agreement .
Clinton wants to expand the renewable energi@@ es with their investment program and calls : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energy and million jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it , that we are . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements are the two compet@@ itors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ splant@@ ation trade agreements , would not want to sign .
at the same time , both but not want to isol@@ ate the U.S. from international trade , but simply just protect American jobs .
these are also better to be paid by Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hun@@ gry .
it will increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what tr@@ ump in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must go down , then he says he will not be changed .
however , the large discussion of the next month is likely to develop the tax@@ ation of the two camps .
on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to load the economy and citizens to sp@@ ur growth .
his crit@@ ics keep before , the budget defic@@ it would only be bigger .
on the other side Clinton indicates that at least from the rich men want to pay more taxes , and their crit@@ ics say , more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman has gained experience with sexual violence . &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost already to everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house provides refuge .
four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby , which is at the most one year old .
one has a little son in the arm .
he looks curi@@ ous with great eyes in the room .
his mother st@@ owed on the top plate .
until they noted that it is wat@@ ched .
she sm@@ iled , and k@@ iss@@ es the little ones .
the scene affects normal .
until you talk with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid workers in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run .
four women in the kitchen are fully @-@ fle@@ dged .
they live in the Munich North , in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized hotels for all@@ ergy @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up together with Pro Famil@@ ia and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ance .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are no longer than visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here , has made his escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee because they are polit@@ ically per@@ sec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten death or death , because they send them as a h@@ opes to send them as a h@@ opes to Europe . &quot;
women weigh several reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
in their home they have experienced experience with sexual violence , tw@@ ins , hon@@ orary mor@@ den , s@@ la@@ very , or forced pro@@ st@@ itution .
it drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that t@@ ugs for a bottle of water is demand for a bottle of water , is not a rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end once they were ank@@ ed in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
even here are all women in refugees were often considered a min@@ der@@ ous and worse and worse case .
this leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich Region , are trau@@ mat@@ ised , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not volun@@ tar@@ ily . &quot;
many women are so usual that they say nothing .
&quot; or she does not trust , open to talk about it , because the shame is too big . &quot;
since they were often not ready to help , need more accommodations for them , requ@@ est@@ ing B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District ra@@ ins are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they were using a similar project as in Munich in its cour@@ age range , answer some with no .
in the pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are about something in fore@@ most governments of governments .
even in Schwaben alone , women are not separated by women , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Oberbayern , under@@ - and Central fran@@ ken there are rooms in some common floors or own houses only for sole women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bayern , there are two central accommodations for women .
the &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; also calls for women to be ho@@ used by men in the European Parliament .
in a study published for the Committee , it is : &quot; it &apos;s very important that men and women can be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; is missing privacy or men and women together , it may come to - persist@@ ent - violence against women . &quot;
especially the shower room should be separate and suitable for women easily , stands in the study .
as much the women of this protection , you can read at the And@@ rang in Munich , which there is home to the house in Munich .
&quot; since itself has been speaking , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could make a second house .
assistant denti@@ sts : amounts due to new emplo@@ yers
dep@@ uty of the assistant , their union contrac@@ tors have been called to adop@@ t new workers in disp@@ utes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his entire Council , beginning of September more work action .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been so@@ lic@@ t to enter the concerns on the contract .
assistant and media agents in July about the re@@ j@@ ection of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of his members who have voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained qui@@ et@@ ly quiet &quot; to problems what the contract was rejected .
she said , &quot; In response , the J@@ DC President is voted to re@@ ject the proposed new contract to re@@ ject this new contract . &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board has set a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a self @-@ governmental policy measures that starts at the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes resulted in that assist@@ ants from sixth year , the first total falls in history of N@@ HS .
according to the election of the BM@@ A assistant , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the re@@ j@@ ection of the agreed contract terms , which had been ad@@ vised by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions , which was still in front of the vote by 54@@ 0,000 assist@@ ants and media events that should be advant@@ age@@ ous and supp@@ ose to be accepted .
according to the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would have to be introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of exter@@ iors &quot; ?
it was a bar@@ est which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met in Tuesday to announce the hands and an official end of the eight months in the war of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin met his Turkish back@@ ups in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I can &apos;t forget that Ankara re@@ conc@@ iliation that Ankara re@@ conc@@ iliation .
it was the handle , yes .
but putting the smile in the smile , and radi@@ ated almost warm@@ th , even for his return conditions .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an said to be repeated von his &quot; love friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of five times .
I could not count anymore .
he also promised that the relationship with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis but could even be improved .
the next day , a newspaper reported that Erd@@ og@@ an would have risen so that it would never be a bit of lim@@ entary .
me seemed to be a little enthusi@@ asm rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s imp@@ ec@@ oming , sustainable cooling showed that the government of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first that he mentioned in his entry , the shooting of a Russian campaign aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey .
in Moscow , Moscow was sc@@ anned .
Putin divided from and accused Ankara to have fallen back into the back .
the Ver@@ ger was even bigger , since it was committed by a mean bo@@ y@@ friend .
the Vet@@ ro@@ id re@@ build it difficult when it &apos;s not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media conducted a very restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed to it , when the Turks would carry all the debt for everything .
at the serious , the acc@@ us@@ ations of conduc@@ tive civil servants were benef@@ ited to benefit from illegal oil retail in areas of Syri@@ ans who want to be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he took this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only in place because Putin received from the President of the Erd@@ og@@ an , who wanted to hear it .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an arm@@ ist@@ ice club is clear on hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs first line all friends who can get in the last month after the last month at a failed coup .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economical mot@@ ives .
Russian sanctions have met Turkey - especially the prohib@@ ition of charter flights , which usually reach several million Russian tourists from the Turkish coast .
the number of numbers decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour oper@@ ators and charter companies will simp@@ lif@@ y if the flights be taken again .
they will count towards a late se@@ asonal day of the Mediterranean .
this week , the national TV cheap fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again .
a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i form@@ ulated this way : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes are long here . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara has risen in the west , since it was reaction to the attemp@@ ting making a weak answer .
to this , the benefit of the accession to the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to draw out of cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the west .
in Ankara , the Russian state of government won a bonus that he asked for the chosen state @-@ rich support for the chosen state organ@@ e .
that &apos;s worth a self @-@ condition , that itself has a self @-@ sitting an@@ xi@@ ety before reg@@ im@@ ing .
the summit in this smooth palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one as it described an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of exterior decor@@ ates &quot; to introduce two countries that are cast away from the West and bad .
nevertheless , despite the public re@@ conc@@ iliation , between the two still a wide difference .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently announced the role as a Nobel Prize , but to support Russia and Turkey .
it could be noted that after almost three hours of the initial pre@@ sidents on the press conference , they told that they had not st@@ acks the topic once again .
the President of Turkey missed it deli@@ ber@@ ately to answer over their differences , while Putin decided to worship this .
it &apos;s no clear con@@ sens@@ us where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months , fine host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when the NATO member of Turkey canc@@ els the Russian fighter jet - certainly better to talk the two heads of state at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland is no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Supervisory Office , the R@@ BS is supposed to be reduced to a back@@ office role on a back@@ office .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is not available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Global Am@@ b@@ itions by the Bank .
the bank has since been dist@@ anced , when she had almost collap@@ sed almost eight years ago , and had to be saved .
in this time , br@@ is@@ ers &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other devices to protect others .
they supported the international sport in Spon@@ sor@@ ing , by Six Nations Rug@@ by until Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now , she decided to move more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland , but is not initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all R@@ s@@ b Refer@@ ences , dedicated to the central headquarters and the stock release at Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller trad@@ emar@@ ks of private custom@@ ization , which will get more importance - Cout@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand R@@ s@@ b belongs to our Invest@@ ors brand , as well as the brand , under which our staff are employed , since we will now be more to a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
I say now that we have no global goals , but local goals .
each of these stamps will be in their own con@@ greg@@ ations for something different and our employees are working under these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations spon@@ sor@@ ing that it will increase the perc@@ ep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in his Sports Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the bank of brands , as we focus us inside ( we asked us to make this better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief of Staff .
it would have been very c@@ yn@@ ically in three years ago , if we would say that we will be a great bank for our customers and have been launched .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re@@ act these brands again , therefore I think that the time has come .

Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jockey of Modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone that has reached only a few before it .

three years ago he had returned difficulties when he returned from his six months of lock , but he showed an impressive character strength to beat his branch and return to his bu@@ ck .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori , previously said that he will continue with compet@@ itions until his least 50.@@ th year of life .
Russia Putin mo@@ ist Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin was un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the Soviet Union for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transportation issues .
in a statement of the Kre@@ ml , it is that Putin had ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of his duties as Chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidency administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been recru@@ ited in Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he made his gradu@@ ation in the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in Tokyo in Tokyo .
on the site of the Kre@@ ml , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the protocol manager and Chief Executive Officer .
on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think that it is the most important task of government to support your activities as state @-@ of @-@ office and controls to support your instructions .
Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his position to leave his post and re@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
con@@ vin@@ ce the smile ?
this step has been myst@@ eri@@ ous in Moscow .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the most severe conf@@ ession Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet Intelligence , the K@@ GB .
Chief of Staff was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed in television , the men of staff moved to his own request at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , here only few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections .
so is the epis@@ ode of a kind of battle ?
the white currently no one .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was glori@@ fied as a potenti@@ ally President on once the Russian environmental policy is based on large sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ sis .
in his remarks on Putin , who are c@@ ited on the site of the Kre@@ ml , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I had asked this very comp@@ lic@@ ated post - one could almost say - compl@@ ain a weight for four years .
as it is out , I have been chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidency for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov participated in the Post@@ s in December 2011 .
earlier , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ cher@@ ish Intelligence ( FSB ) , the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty .
when Putin called his power , he called Ivan@@ ov called one of five people who tru@@ sted most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could have been President of Putin on the second term of Putin as a third term of putting Putin against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became President of three @-@ half years later .

we are all witnesses of a engineering art of a ver@@ ily ep@@ ic measures in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the extension between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck has a heating system which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
a total of almost 79 % of the entire bridge &apos;s total bridge and the last section of the deck gets a concrete structure for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted at its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge , said : &quot; the first lock is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
in this fantastic project the closure of the pione@@ ering high and deep bo@@ ilers .
following the installation of the last street top and its connection with which in the extension of the North tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the North or landscape side .
this was reached by pul@@ ling of the northern Zu@@ br@@ inger@@ bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very hard activity at the same time .
massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , approximately 6.000 tons weighs and has had to be moved with an incl@@ ination of approx . 3 % .
he@@ ats , as the toler@@ ances where the team has worked , was tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily worked all very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck yet alive . &quot;
three men have &quot; luck yet alive , &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .

the three men had difficulties to sw@@ im , while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; we saw what the boat went up to herself , and set ourselves the worst of the worst , &quot; said the head of the rescue centre of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds did not take the boat unless their range , until we left to water , &quot; added he added .
two of the men were saved from a local fisher@@ man , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found at a bo@@ b@@ lowing without life@@ jacket .

as the police announced yesterday I had the 50 year old to get the key to get his personal things .

this al@@ arm@@ ated dar@@ auf@@ hin of his sister .
together with their life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .

who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ ert cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Grü@@ ne my : investors will be much more stronger than the oblig@@ ation .
how do you respon@@ d to bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 favorable apartments ?
the SPD pro@@ poses a &quot; trade concept plan &quot; meeting .
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first line is to ask the question : who is supposed to build the favour@@ able apartments ?
a provision is missing .
Christoph Brat@@ mann has said : &quot; we are living with the Gre@@ ens Par@@ liamentary Group : &quot; who want to build on urban areas , must host 20 percent of all apartments as a social apartments . &quot;
however , the affordable housing can be made , however , too .
however , the major disp@@ ute in the town hall is , however , as fr@@ ying : &quot; how are you to build with investors , who want to build home their faces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors at least 10 per cent , but as possible as 20 per cent of apartments as a social apartments . &quot;
a new town @-@ housing program , which will cost million costs and will be fin@@ anced , is scheduled to take care .
the problem , the fr@@ ying : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fr@@ actions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors a few regulations .
the lin@@ ke is still hardness for investors .
regardless of what the Brat@@ man , a pro@@ pul@@ sion of the situation in the residential market .
the concept concept is implemented , will ensure further tasks in building management .
more staff is required .
it is unknown whether we will get professionals .
but the program does not remember the program : because the 1260 new apartments , which should be built in wards .
but how do you compare the loss of another 1,@@ 300 favour@@ able apartments , whose funding will run out in the next years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the plan@@ etary spokes@@ woman in Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city .
in addition , we would have to be able to re@@ cover apartments back into the price connection .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
solve the problem for a blow .
because in the western town run the end of Fri@@ sten .
around 1800 apartments could be back in the price connection for cheap apartments .
only : this will not want the owner , out of housing companies .
for example , the number of the social apartments in the West city is dra@@ st@@ ically increased , remov@@ es the goal of the so @-@ called through mixture .
a concentration of social swe@@ ars in just a few city parts should no longer give it anymore .
the Green Party expect that there is still movement in discussion .
party whi@@ p of Holger Her@@ lit@@ schke we@@ ep : &quot; for a wide majority , CD@@ U needs to get into the boat . &quot;
have focused on more buildings for a single @-@ family homes .
but what does not say that any com@@ promise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting of health and luck that worth it worth
it is fascinating , how the world is changed .
that te@@ ens and child to play no longer to go outside , but rather you prefer to spend their leisure time to rigid , in the last decade of rep@@ ent .
for Pok@@ em@@ on Go you go to pick people from the sofa and will be active .
the time at the screen was initially set on the TV , then video playback and most recently limited to smart@@ phones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities in the open .
I go to of course of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a App , which were created in the 1990s , which were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later released a drawing series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of pop culture sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
market launch in other countries has been moved through massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users as a T@@ inder , and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go left with their smart phones and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which are per@@ sec@@ uted with a GPS per@@ sec@@ uted , once they have found once again , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
one generation that played the game , when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a si@@ z@@ able increase in steps taken by the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35,000 users , divided the Washington Post , distributed within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed , who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company knows not , who plays the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it looks like the raw data to increase output .
many public re@@ conn@@ t@@ amp@@ age to health , people want to participate in &quot; 30 minutes &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; every day to be actively sei@@ zed ears , because many public messages are coming in the health bor@@ ing and of people come back .
nevertheless , the importance of sports can &apos;t be reviewed .
those who drives regularly sport , reduces his chan@@ ces to explore cancer or de@@ pression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages which is too long to run them here .
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open car that you have fun .
thus , three pillars of the health are covered - motion , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people close on the hunt even new friends .
like always there are m@@ ür@@ ric game der@@ der@@ ber , who always have to compl@@ ain about a little weight .
and yes , someone might run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a break@@ through .
even if you have a smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit already before our activity , they gave no reason to play sport , as it does this game .
the New will lose its maturity , and use the use with the time .
however , due to the poker success , there will be more games to give the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ate in real world and will help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ k
forget the pressure .
forget the hy@@ pe .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the imm@@ unity .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
eff@@ ort@@ less@@ ly on the beams .
breath@@ taking on the ground .
on gan@@ s line brilliant .
and finally the Olympic winner too .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to be combined with sur@@ ge and enlar@@ ged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was evi@@ dent in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ sion@@ sk@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swe@@ eper in the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics , Brazil , th@@ urs@@ day .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual US , which wins a majority ranking , and tot@@ alling its fifth , while the best of their generation or even to be at all .
she broke out in te@@ ars when its final result was shown and a long journey took place at this moment .
this success shows it to the same le@@ ague as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has won the last three years , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals , which include a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision that she said the Olympic winner of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on said that she has ever seen &quot; the Best Tur@@ ner@@ in , which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited it a final ex@@ am in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t think so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather , between her and a load over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man ass@@ orted , after they have won gold and silver in a unique event for women in the Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , and won .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday during she retired on the f@@ are@@ well celebration of a retired man co@@ alition , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi used as a issu@@ er sign .
although Bil@@ es consisted of it , while their long trail on top , never have planned to have the future , it is not true .
a part of their ground exercises - that included its typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is on Latin American music to fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , that was adopted by their grand@@ parents as a little child , and trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother discovered during a school fr@@ aud at the gym in Bo@@ or@@ man , became force .
she has lost no multi @-@ fight competition since the summer of 2013 , as much as it will stop as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina made easy through two shooting , painted the picture .
Swe@@ be@@ zel and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world title - listening to the world .
she again won 15,@@ 433 back on the Swe@@ eper and restored with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground nor on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man ra@@ ises her as her grand@@ master - a pure form - and te@@ ars applied on Bil@@ ly billi@@ ant red , white and blue Eyel@@ iner , as the vision who described it once in their collection , to reality .
the power of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a re@@ ven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze em@@ e@@ da@@ ille went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man of cre@@ ativity was called by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma &quot; to a lead .
after her floor , they cast down the audience to the audience , over@@ whel@@ med by a com@@ eb@@ ack which was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful .
what else is concerned , thus the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Twe@@ et of the beginning of this week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims were killed in series production by playing music in the car
according to the police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed in one of the most dead@@ ly attacks since one decade in the first serial production of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a single journey , said the authorities .
the per@@ pet@@ ter opens eight shots from a hand fire@@ side , while he stood on the side of the car and he fled with another car , is described in the report .
the police shared that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a pre@@ f@@ case , since the att@@ ack@@ ers not included the hand@@ bags , or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were in possession of an adult victims .
the Poli@@ ce@@ al pre@@ ached by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sl@@ ot@@ ting was to be led to the investig@@ ator that she is connected with four previous att@@ acking .
in total , mostly in h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic residential neighbor@@ ho@@ ods were killed in nine months in nine months and two further injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown bub@@ ble from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ator refused to reve@@ al the evidence that they have linked to the concl@@ usions , and the attacks were linked , and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to its inju@@ ries and died later .
Liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died before the place .
a witness to the police decided that it was not unusual for them to sit in a car , sitting and listen to music .
the authorities published a police report on the bre@@ wer@@ y , which had a half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and went out of which it was the work of the serial production facility .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball frag@@ ments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ ie : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves the singing , to@@ ys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his aging , Edmund micro@@ zep@@ ts , the result of a genetic dis@@ order , about that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know .
when he was first arrived at home , my first thought , I create it .
I do not create this .
I haven &apos;t let me down .
what is not true -- of course it is left to be out , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband has been informed that Edmund they can never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not sur@@ vive again .
some doctors even went to finance it to institu@@ tional and institu@@ tional .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I knew not that people still do , &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto .
Edmund may run with help with help .
Edmund was still sitting down until his third year , neither sit down and still can &apos;t speak .
but he makes it slow progress .
he can run with support and bike .
he loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing something to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we give him a look at , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical drawing language -- it says . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ie has a variety of causes : genetic such as Edmund as well as inf@@ ections with viruses such as mas@@ ks or z@@ ic@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it influ@@ ences the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus Inf@@ ants .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emot@@ ional price of a certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t know it yet .
I have been a long time since long time , because I did not expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful fil@@ ing for mot@@ hers of babies with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emerg@@ ency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , divided the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and Sandbags , respectively .
Ste@@ ele said that the village of Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa had fallen ten thousand times .
a flo@@ oding system is used over wide parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service resulted in that area of additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could be falling due to rain .
in the south of Alab@@ ama , a Fl@@ ut@@ ory system was deployed on Friday during the Mobile region .
the river Com@@ ite near B@@ aton Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , will reach all prob@@ ability after the weekend record level .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers are many houses in the subur@@ ban near B@@ aton Rouge .
he also said that a current @-@ down@@ ward over@@ flo@@ oding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , because this is just slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ticket , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , border line in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached on Friday at 9@@ am the highest stand , ever recorded .
Rett@@ ung@@ ste@@ ams still inhab@@ its people from the flo@@ wing water into the district of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Le@@ Roy Hans@@ ford , his wife and his wrist , were among those who were saved near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Cre@@ ek , which is usually increased by more than 400 feet from his house , increasing by night .
he said that one another bar@@ n , who dwell@@ eth near , had been war@@ ned .
&quot; we are wat@@ ched , and the water prev@@ ented and prev@@ ented , &quot; said Hans@@ ford .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had lived in the 48 years , in which she had lived there , had never seen such a rise of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members say all the dis@@ abilities , and he would have the only one that sw@@ im .
Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ pers had been saved every three in a great military trucks and they had been brought to the closest fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they had been ho@@ used until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flo@@ oding &quot; had developed rapidly , because it was still severe ra@@ inf@@ alls , and that the authorities have ev@@ acu@@ ation assign@@ ments in bed .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a ob@@ server near Liv@@ ing@@ stone starts from midnight to Friday morning from 13,@@ 75 inches rain .

in the city of Ham@@ mond of the village of Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa , almost two do@@ zen streets were closed due to the high water and Sandbags , hope to hold the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last great flood which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Agri@@ rum of the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incid@@ ent .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp the Emerg@@ ency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it remained on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful houses have been reported on Thursday than sur@@ pris@@ ingly , but on Friday it was not reported until now .

&quot; he has done so much , his little body was cut out of balls , divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez @-@ the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boys was classified in a hospital as a critical , and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys divided the transmitter , that it is expected to be re@@ warded .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .

Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ ke for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were per@@ sec@@ uted to various assault rif@@ ug@@ es , over@@ m@@ owing the crime .

they re@@ cover and the police seek after a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie need
this is what I pres@@ cri@@ bed to me under the women &apos;s ol@@ ys@@ function in the tower and that out of more than a reason .
first , I have been doing so domin@@ ant since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA were never domin@@ ant .
and second : this crew has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Laur@@ en &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls who inspired other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w ist and Mad@@ ison Ko@@ cher , the Cat@@ holic@@ kin is abr@@ ished , makes every proud .
the USA refle@@ cts the USA .
it has the black and h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport .
over the past four years , the number one was one of the female turbo@@ char@@ ists .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a sur@@ prising Olympi@@ ag@@ Festival and America .
now the world was able to witness the belie@@ vable performance of three @-@ fold world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was un@@ expected , but most effective Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ic rout@@ ines manufactured .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als US , was awarded for women in an individual combined events for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but like to see Turn@@ over in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote the same way as A@@ ly and Mad@@ ison to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics is only four turbines in the team . in addition , this year is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sports and Turner first line in private g@@ ym@@ s that will be exciting for training , business , travel , travel , travel , and hotel costs ( for the Trainer and their Turner and families ) . the list can be able to continue .
the majority of these g@@ ym@@ s are located in we@@ alth@@ y suburbs , which can support business .
in these clubs , Turner will get your total training and this is a long @-@ term commitment for families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , coach of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ers by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both their athletes who have started with the tower since then .
we have to insp@@ ire the con@@ greg@@ ations of Au@@ n un@@ numbered , young girls who wants to insp@@ ire by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easier access training .
I founded my Turn@@ out by 20 years .
with my events we have free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15.000 visitors ( mainly black and h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic ) , and national and international winner .
in September , we exp@@ ecting to Detroit ( my home town ) to provide the youth high @-@ quality turbines that make the possibility of learning from this great Olympic sports .
Tur@@ ns designed strength , flexibility and coordin@@ ation for the body and hard work , discipl@@ ine , and Sug@@ gest@@ ions for the spirit .
this combination offers liv@@ ely benefits for health , as well as for the school and professional success .
it is the in@@ spiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to identify themselves and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
that is an interesting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Mad@@ ison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic club gol@@ ds and thank you to begin their way to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness can def@@ end elections in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was last year on the release of a government report due to cor@@ ruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to us that far more widespread vot@@ ers came in to be ig@@ no@@ red as a non @-@ non @-@ governmental report today .
the former office member Sir Eric P@@ ickl@@ es g@@ aten the police , election observation and Rath@@ es , evidence of electoral mis@@ use of &quot; over@@ sensitive to eth@@ eless and religion &quot; are ig@@ no@@ red .
the former minister of integration and municipal government , who now is a anti @-@ cor@@ ruption of religious mot@@ ives , said that the police should be allowed to set off the police suff@@ ice outside the suff@@ ers to protect vot@@ ers outside the election .
he re@@ commen@@ ds that vot@@ ers should lead a ID card to prove their identity .
at the moment a vot@@ ers need to call only his name and address .
the report suggest@@ s , not dist@@ ant ink on the fing@@ ers of a person , if they cho@@ oses her choice , to prevent any one twice .
W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should receive more protection , Sir Eric says .
it ur@@ ges that the press has become more access to common documents and decisions of non @-@ official commission@@ ing or working groups .
&quot; it is not only responsible for the election , but should also protect the commun@@ al government before the broad@@ ening cor@@ ruption and financial process , which comes to protect , &quot; he said .
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets elections to the east of London .
last year , a Special Tribunal found that the official may@@ or l@@ ut@@ ons must be cor@@ rup@@ ted after a cor@@ rupt and illegal intern@@ ships .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have been per@@ sec@@ uted the religious fe@@ el@@ ings of his Muslim community &quot; and that he would have had his crit@@ ics with R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ ologies for silence .
Rah@@ man is supposed to have his campaign on the basis that it was reli@@ ably a reli@@ ably g@@ rief of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either und@@ ou@@ bt@@ ful or the sequence of a desc@@ endant , when one person cho@@ oses one person .
Sir Eric told that it should be wise in the whole country for fr@@ aud .
in particular , in particular , particularly al@@ arm@@ ing to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letter - for the older members of the Muslim community had been made to people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to help the electoral system , including the management of instruc@@ tors to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof , the pressure on protection of some ethnic min@@ ority was exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people to choose to choose the aging of aging , especially communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or ban@@ glad@@ bach background .
&quot; there was any concerns that ... state institutions would like to ignor@@ ant such behaviour due to &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; in@@ sensitive regarding the Eth@@ n@@ nie and Religion would be ig@@ no@@ red . &quot;
Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to reduce the system including the prohib@@ ition to stop the political activ@@ ists letters to stop &quot; elections . &quot;
the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May into consider@@ ation , requires even toug@@ her registration tests to prevent the sub@@ directory for immig@@ ration and social @-@ rug@@ ation purposes .
apply options into account , select the choice prior to your statement .
not removed ink on the finger of a person when she has cast their voice to prevent any one cho@@ oses twice .
system@@ atic inspec@@ tions about the nationality of a person to make sure they are optional .
a three year @-@ old limitation on applications on an automatic post@@ er@@ di@@ alling code .
prohib@@ ition that political activ@@ ists are full @-@ elections and envelop@@ es .
the police have to specify the link to shut down the suff@@ ers .
a legisl@@ ative change that pro@@ secution for an indictment due to the repres@@ sion of the People Act 1983 ( Government of the referendum in 1983 ) .
photographer for@@ b@@ ade in Ele@@ ction stations .
request that only English can be used in the choice stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensive training , to ensure that the employees are generally consistent if vot@@ ers go down to the election .
Sir Eric falls on Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly , that after the Tower Ham@@ lets you have been given no penalty .
&quot; the Elec@@ ted Court has Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty , based on cor@@ rupt and illegal intern@@ ships , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons for reference to the high demands in criminal procedure .
he also critic@@ ises the real &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of the election regist@@ rations of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court &apos;s Court in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country is we@@ ather@@ ed as the mother of the par@@ li@@ aments , a proud hei@@ r , but the spread of elections and mis@@ led of some authorities thre@@ aten these good rep@@ utation .

bu@@ yer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ t over wife , in the middle of business sch@@ am@@ less under@@ wear
the bu@@ yer did not know where they should see when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants .
in order to spar@@ ed the situation , she pressed , as they saw it in it , and put them back into the shelf .
she st@@ epp@@ ed up and try four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ia Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , at .
Pri@@ ests Shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman had tried under@@ p@@ ants , before they put back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son who had been in the same time in business , said after the myst@@ eri@@ ous woman had tast@@ ed the under@@ wear , &quot; she left again and buy the shop without something . &quot;
she said , &quot; These men could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the out@@ lay , their own sh@@ oul@@ ders and trousers , and tried them .
&quot; she tried not to find a somewhat dis@@ cre@@ et place to do it - it just stood there , fre@@ ch like Oskar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ red when they returned the shel@@ ters who didn &apos;t have fallen , since they put it back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ p@@ ants before they finally decided that you were not right to come back again and went down .
&quot; you don &apos;t forget it to mind that someone observed that someone would like to buy the under@@ lying in circumstances which she had tried . &quot;
Ms. David@@ son , 33 , who lives in Kent she said , &quot; How to think any man would take home sick with home , who had one another person and had not washed . &quot;
the incid@@ ent happened on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs. David@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to pull the clothes pieces from the sale after she went - what is good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate you to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and find out that another wife she had left and returned , and they did not be washed . &quot;

how to re@@ cover with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of Waff@@ en@@ ane .
the world outside is an dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him a little saf@@ er .
we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a grand@@ master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to re@@ loc@@ ate with armed inc@@ ense .
whether you come from front or from the rear you will show you this video as you turn to your inc@@ ense .
if you att@@ ach to you from behind the back then you should turn to your att@@ ack@@ ers , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and &quot; says from the Line of Fire , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bows .
beat him then with the kne@@ es in the bar and turn , while the att@@ ack@@ ers forward pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run and move back , while they make up the weapon on it .
for Ang@@ ers that appro@@ aches from the front , is the technology similar - move your body from the Line of Fire , sei@@ ze the weapon and rotate it , so that the att@@ ack@@ ers cannot shoot .
if you prefer the weight at the weapon and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle before they move back and make the weapon on it .
sounds hard ?
look at the video to see it exactly as it was Miz@@ pe@@ chi .
but remember that it is at a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est , your money is enough - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide of his tongue in the most dir@@ ty places of Europe
a British travel under@@ went the immune system and dig@@ n@@ ity of a serious review by taking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and ek@@ ad@@ ful locations of Europe .
the Moder@@ ator and it@@ au@@ tor Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ orted its re@@ location on a euro banknotes , a sch@@ em@@ brac@@ ing on the Pic@@ cad@@ illy Cir@@ cus , a rin@@ se button in the toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before departure , he used a lumin@@ aire to show and show us what he will leave .
but the experim@@ ent , which was fil@@ ed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; brought some sur@@ prising results to daylight .
the thought to re@@ cover the rins@@ ing button of a tractor , which has already been used by thousands of others , but it is really imper@@ vious to shock in a kitchen .
in his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright joined the physi@@ ci@@ ans and medical experts about the funding of Dar@@ mb@@ ak@@ ter@@ ies , as well as his own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily he didn &apos;t leave anything that he was re@@ fu@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of its gut , by giving birth by the world and very strange things .
public money change on train stations up to jet@@ ting of toilets , the task set its immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child was relatively un@@ concerned , what my health : and I have tast@@ ed all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ amm@@ ation . &quot;
in the film , he was just a fall to his rep@@ utation .
the only thing he re@@ j@@ ection , was a dir@@ ty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ position showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ric number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the Lumin@@ omet@@ ric number of fresh@@ ly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to re@@ im@@ itate after their lumin@@ osity exceeds 4000 units , whereas in fresh@@ ly washed hands one of less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish manufacturers of da@@ iry v@@ ali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ ial number of several sites like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; this is the worst thing that I kept in a toilet , close to . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;m not afraid here because it is perfect here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturers of da@@ iry products .
the company used Mr. Wright with V@@ ali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi and D , to support the funding of Dar@@ mb@@ ak@@ ter@@ ia and the immune system .
V@@ ali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating , and the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics are declared at the same time .
we carried forward Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by which we end@@ ure that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest is int@@ est@@ inal health to a global phenom@@ enon
instead just about the products , we wanted to make them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily surroundings , the importance of the int@@ est@@ inal health and how it is linked with the immune system .
growing interest in the int@@ est@@ inal health is a global phenom@@ enon and with the documentary , we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense for hum@@ or !
Tom Hak@@ ala who led the film director - I would like to say , &quot; I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had some of the things which I have told him , like the el@@ derly Russian toilet , which will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course , it was easier to bring to what it was easier to try them and others , in which it was quite hard .
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dir@@ ty le@@ ak@@ ies . &quot;
in one of the survey conducted by V@@ ali@@ o , 84 per cent of the respon@@ dents of Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi and 58 percent said that they can use at least occasionally products that contain lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
social family Dest@@ ro@@ yed in front of Del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family for@@ s@@ ook their social apartment for a delay of £ 50,000 because they de@@ pu@@ ri@@ zed their neigh@@ bo@@ urs .
Tan@@ ya sk@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown on a long list of compl@@ aints by their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their property , sho@@ cked workers of housing estate , owned by the property in an ir@@ rep@@ airs condition .
the walls showed up cl@@ amped holes , sc@@ rap@@ ers were stri@@ pped on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti , and gra@@ ff@@ iti has been lubric@@ ated to walls .
the family have been removed and it is assumed that they now lives in a private accommodation
DONNA Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they don &apos;t fear the apartment .
she said , &quot; It was a complete album here and I am the view that people do not have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account , as this estate probably is probably considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ alian .
the family is not@@ ori@@ ous and their rep@@ utation is also .
the couple had three sons , which had lived in the apartment and the police said that the Ter@@ ror that had added the family , en@@ ders of inhabitants , thre@@ es@@ ab@@ use , dro@@ gen@@ ab@@ use , dro@@ gen@@ et@@ ion , and exc@@ essive cry , stre@@ aming , and flu@@ ids .
Skel@@ eton , 47 , whose name stood at the rental treaty , was an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ ara behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , cold ru@@ bb@@ ish was found .
there were dep@@ rec@@ ated in the property in which past drugs , the wooden legs were torn
neigh@@ bo@@ urs therefore they said they w@@ ished them on the road and touched the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ated her and their partner for this week , after they gave them a pro@@ long@@ ed term of 11 weeks to tar@@ ry up volun@@ tar@@ ily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were del@@ igh@@ ted by inher@@ ited neigh@@ bo@@ urs , saying that her life was made of hell .
one said : &quot; they were going to be so@@ ared . &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them , and it was always bad .
the count@@ less times that we say the police here , are incredible .
&quot; today we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up , because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not usual !
now , where it is finally ready , it will be beautiful .
Adam Vogel , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ for@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have to so@@ w the family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , which was called the police in regular intervals , 20 years .
on the over@@ whel@@ med page of the municipal house were ru@@ bb@@ ish and old to@@ ys were thrown .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the Mi@@ eter has ab@@ ro@@ red any responsibility for its behaviour and the family of their family , as a Del@@ og@@ ation always is the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing in bed .

presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump announced the weak@@ ness of his election campaign in the former repub@@ lican High@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ scale and self @-@ secu@@ rely ind@@ ented Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns how correc@@ tions reported .
after having cast 16 ri@@ val within the first repub@@ lican camp out of the race , the dou@@ b@@ ts now grow in the battle for the White House .
&quot; we have great problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of the Protest@@ ant Christians , which he asked support for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
gu@@ ilt are false reports about his candi@@ da@@ cy , he took up his well @-@ known media .
repub@@ lican High Bur@@ ck@@ les
Ut@@ ah is normally a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June according to Tr@@ ump and his con@@ voy of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the state of the federal state .
as a dangerous , Arizona and Georgia are considered .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ator CNB@@ C answered Tr@@ ump on the question how he again stop the pre@@ mar@@ sch Clin@@ tons again wool : &quot; just as I have done it so far . &quot;
and if there be back : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he do nothing , than to tell the truth . &quot;
if it did not speak for him in the end of the reasons of political cor@@ ruption , this is true that Tr@@ ump has continued .
then I return to a very good living .
according to press reports , the party is threat@@ ening to submit to the support of his election campaign , it should be able to present no better circumstances .

the world anti @-@ d@@ op@@ ing agency had exercis@@ ed a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , a anti @-@ d@@ op@@ ing law and a functional control system .
the Law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia beginning .
in the epis@@ ode , the WA@@ DA Kenya took up the list of countries whose d@@ op@@ ing com@@ b@@ ating form with the rules of the WA@@ DA are .
Kenya is considered as a large runner @-@ in nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals from the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , ARD were always supposed to be easily accessible in Kenya &apos;s d@@ op@@ ing means , and give it a significant ment@@ ality of the sport .
the I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und presented last similar research in Kenya , as he was in the Russian Athletics .

one musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s master@@ piece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic , and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth .
in the orchestra , Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ el@@ an Di@@ oc@@ gent@@ en Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhyth@@ m , &quot; flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ated .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in its Tempo , and her mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ stein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older of that Maria .
she remin@@ ds with W@@ eh@@ mut to her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fas@@ c@@ inated me .
first , because they are un@@ usually extra@@ ordin@@ arily !
and then there would be Mari@@ as person@@ ality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
it is so cle@@ ver , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very pas@@ sion@@ ate .
&quot; it is similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of lo@@ ying for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it &apos;s such a honour to work with you .
she is a mon@@ ster gener@@ ous man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artists and very pas@@ sion@@ ate ! &quot;
conductor is a necess@@ ity for him .
you can see it in every one of his movements , in his bli@@ sters , it is his life !
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a che@@ er@@ ful approach to life , that &apos;s very important !
Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; highly currently : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ ur@@ ers and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
today we went to New York at that time , the Pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ic@@ ans had gone back to New York , and they didn &apos;t want to know the New York residents .
these are the same topics , and they are as well as the same as at that time .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality expects to mass acc@@ ursed
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erd@@ og@@ an lo@@ aves , sits on a packed caff@@ eine , &quot; says the pre@@ sidency of the Gü@@ len Foundation in dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish comm@@ une was settled in short @-@ term with ten thousands of protection , from Turkey to Germany .
in the middle course , there could even be a few hundreds of thousands , believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the har@@ vest@@ ing prec@@ eding the Turkish president , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an awa@@ ited the Kur@@ dish comm@@ une in Germany for a mass mortality in Germany .
&quot; short @-@ term real @-@ term I ride out with ten thousands of thousands of troops from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime will fight the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the former chairman of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had passed the out@@ bur@@ sts of offen@@ ders over the months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were on the escape .
after the devast@@ ated coup , there were still se@@ cular and opposition ethnic Turks .
many will begin new to begin in Europe if they are further ex@@ presses in Turkey .
&quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that det@@ ained even refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
the Association Leader accused Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ an cities .
therefore a wool of Erd@@ og@@ an increase the remaining Kur@@ ds to the remaining Kur@@ den .
&quot; they are the last great min@@ ority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Gre@@ eks were already in the past hundred years or driven out , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who also has CD@@ U .
the Federal Government ordered that the Federal Government is &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his trailer . &quot;
in Germany , there is also a &quot; wit@@ ches @-@ hunt &quot; against the Erd@@ og@@ an crit@@ ics .
I feel no more secure in Germany in recent months for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fe@@ ared the escape of many Turks .
more Turks , As@@ ylum are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ als .
the Brand@@ mark is destroyed as a qu@@ alities , teachers and other academ@@ ies the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fits and Erd@@ og@@ an is sitting on a packed caff@@ eine , and also the Kem@@ alists and S@@ lic@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation , and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reported on numbers of the Federal Ministry of State , the Turks introduced the largest group of political asylum in Germany before the coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
at the reporting date June 30 , this is 11,@@ 386 people , and thus nearly 29 per cent of all known as as@@ yl@@ are recognized ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , do not find the war before the war , poverty , or s@@ wor@@ ries .

Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania : &quot; where to go ... &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern : the ones get nothing from the summer elections with - and the holiday from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern .
in 2021 the landing beam will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament approved the beginning of the year .
because Bl@@ ö@@ der as so far , it does not have : summer holidays , heat and landscape fighting - which k@@ iss@@ es itself .
the loc@@ als that are convinced by the suff@@ ici@@ ency , are on vacation .
most of most tourists that are in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no deposit , must not choose the country &apos;s day .
these include practical issues : in the holidays are hel@@ pers to distri@@ bute the posters , aer@@ op@@ ons inflatable , fl@@ yers , and to count towards the end of the vote .
until September 4th , 2016 , the election and the last days of days , Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania has to be gone over on the people .
the hot phase if you can say it , has just begun .
and it also goes to something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , the leader of a SPD / CD@@ U Co@@ alition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , which has been the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting , how powerful Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ r remains and what remains of the end of co@@ alition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes a very un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive campaign , you can see from his big posters .
he travels across land , spread ros@@ es and pl@@ atter@@ s a little with the people , as it is already his legendary debut of Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
in addition , sail@@ ering has got cold feet and is pul@@ pit in Merkel the gu@@ ilt in the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ r .
your refugee policy , their &quot; We want to make up the ascent of the sp@@ oo@@ o@@ ists , what is pres@@ um@@ ably that it is probably the good office .
the CD@@ U with its flag@@ ship data , the Interior Minister Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced even as it is when you have a wrong time on the right place elections .
Angela Merkel has been invited to major expl@@ or@@ ations in the northeast of German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
but the target group was not voted , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as M@@ eckl@@ en@@ burger and Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern , recently in N@@ DR .
but it does not include any other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel .
otherwise the northeast CD@@ U automatically ref@@ uses to market conditions on market conditions and shopping m@@ alls with sun@@ sh@@ ades and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , so we@@ ep Kok@@ ert , plays only one &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union also noticed that you may die in the country the basis that it must be very challeng@@ ed to find a wire to the people .
you just like the left , the SPD , the Green Party : in the country of the country hardly available .
the Council of the CD@@ U election campaign in Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ous : &quot; you need to go to where it is we@@ aken , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , golden wed@@ dings , any birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game , the SPD has called his SPD now called to a dedicated campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Social Democrats last was last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD had a clear level of 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Green Party , a small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , you can create the jump into the country life .
they are out of the holidays need a modern T@@ ug@@ end and lie their electoral campaign , mostly to the internet .
&quot; online campaign , &quot; calls the president Claudia Müller .
otherwise green electoral bu@@ cks to track search for local ab@@ dic@@ ates have been among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Silke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ ves straight with a house boat through the m@@ eckl@@ ist @-@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; Ele@@ ction in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern is no pun@@ ishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ renovation : Gast@@ stätten suffer from pl@@ ywood
at the speed of speed , the B 27 is gently rolling , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ed .
for the fin@@ alists of the construction work , which begin at 5.30 p.m. and just around 20 o &apos;clock , there are just praise .
&quot; that have done everything quite cold , &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet gas station .
this is a superb team .
there is no re@@ treat .
the construction site was able to be moved to the sea @-@ beginning , scheduled to be completed by the end of October , everything will be finished .
although the opposite number is responsible for the construction work , about when there are around the installation of heating stations .
since the construction site has been emig@@ rated since the construction site at O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen and again , the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has again abol@@ ished itself , the traffic situation within the place has been relax@@ ed .
the citizens can now come from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen , from the B 27 again on both sides .
the transport through the place seems back .
&quot; since there were partly significant compl@@ aints , &quot; says the responsible management of the re@@ furb@@ ishment of the re@@ furb@@ ishment of Florian King .
the occup@@ ier of Bach@@ ar@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ road , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many v@@ ast@@ es searched , and rather her Nav@@ i tru@@ sted as the signs .
what happened to do some trucks in housing areas .
the speed limit does not have been observed , the assembly has strengthened the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there was substantial over@@ mar@@ es , &quot; says King who made himself a spot on the location on the location .
there are already two to three per minute bl@@ ended .
the quick@@ est was run at 77 hours kilometers in the pace 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been moved , but it was quiet .
for the busin@@ ess@@ men of the B 27 , it is only a little Tro@@ st that our customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg has now open the road again .
in the cards , busin@@ ess@@ men are not happy to look .
but that the B 27 re@@ furb@@ ishment to them have led to sales revenues , everyone who asks you will look through .
however , some more and some are affected .
who has produced less to do with the &quot; final clients &quot; which has been produced for other companies , for the renovation of barely any consequences .
also in the car house Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks a &quot; most slight decrease in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Local along the road are growing along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words .
that &apos;s already threat@@ ening .
not only him , but all guest restaurants have been hit &quot; hard . &quot;
it is missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be glad about every Euro .
the revenue rose by far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the street activation has thrown his operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his staff have to dis@@ missed .
when I had a firm of 4,000 employees and half had been released , the policy would have to re@@ act differ@@ ently .
instead , Reg@@ ulator President Jörg Schmidt is on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could answer any financial statements , otherwise the host@@ ility will benefit from the benefits of the location on the B 27 . now they had the dis@@ advantages to carry out the re@@ furb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other land cir@@ cles , which was so much more gener@@ ous .
in all sounds , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass .
finally , the family business already has been located here since 17@@ 15 , refer@@ ring to the long history .
but other regular passengers now because of the comp@@ lic@@ ated traffic leadership less often , can understand .

according to the end of the san@@ itation works , G@@ öh@@ ner has no dou@@ b@@ ts .
in spite of cr@@ ises with BSE and av@@ ian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of B 27 construction work on its clients for the largest crisis , which has experienced his host@@ el@@ age in their long history history .
six months of construction work , that is brut@@ al .
in the name of the terror control in the legislation .
following the recent attacks , the Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a cru@@ cial status with terrorism ?
and what does the co@@ alition partner to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the re@@ conc@@ iliation .
all its suggest@@ ions to the co@@ alition partner &quot; polit@@ ically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security room .
they call not hes@@ itate .
other further , further points would be discussed in the parties .
I have also involved in it .
as the Minister of Interior , however , was located on the results and in a &quot; con@@ sens@@ us con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the co@@ alition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach has given a little time before he presents its concl@@ usions on safety in the Republic .
but they are now able to fall more extensive .
one thing is known , announced , re@@ bo@@ red : that a new security authority may take care of the cr@@ un@@ encrypted communication is not new .
not the fact that Germany have to set several EU approach to flight data and weapon .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities are not sur@@ prising .
for part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attack for proposals which have not been to re@@ tain with the SPD : he wants to kno@@ cked out symp@@ ath@@ ing for terr@@ ines under pun@@ ishment and j@@ ihadi@@ sts with double citi@@ zen@@ ship to German pas@@ sport .
&quot; that will be difficult to be more difficult for the SPD , &quot; sp@@ ati@@ al of the CD@@ U man .
he still do this , for reasonable and challeng@@ ing anything , which has no chan@@ ces at the co@@ alition partner .
some new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère too .
they have partially slightly in : it is planning to dep@@ ortation and more possibilities for det@@ ention of human beings from dep@@ ortation .
refugees that will be hau@@ led in the country , they will make their smart@@ phones and social media users for a security check .
in Dul@@ ce for asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than ever - about such , the offen@@ ders , or det@@ ect their papers to det@@ ect their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and just@@ ified .
some even un@@ balanced and can open questions open .
and with some points - when the in@@ equality of thought for instance - is the question : what does that actually do with certain@@ ty and terror ?
Yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it is not able to provide the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
there were also many people in view of the high refugees Sor@@ gen around the safety .
and things that occup@@ ies the people , now they were not cut down in constitu@@ encies .
the inner security is enormous so trem@@ end@@ ous in the focus .
only the stops in the neighbour@@ hood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nizza .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the saf@@ eg@@ u@@ arding is great .
and yes , there are fighting for war .
Union and SPD bring together on the topic of internal security and therefore increasingly in position .
during the past days there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ th disp@@ ute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security issues of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior Minister , in which the dep@@ or@@ ch@@ efs also a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of the double citi@@ zen@@ ship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also fe@@ ared here to be re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ent .
from a return from the double pass , he will nothing .
we have called the discussion in Germany .
it re@@ fresh , be not mean@@ ing@@ ful .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban , he constitu@@ tional concerns .
whether his own package on all corners are constitu@@ tional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ alition partner , must still show only .
it is a lot in mind that could care for war .
but the SPD tries to try out at the topic of internal security .
Part@@ en@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only once a carefully talks and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contri@@ butes security further . &quot;
yet Volkswagen is g@@ lim@@ iting .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the supplier numbers are going to increase .
but not in all markets it runs .
in the back call , the work is a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries into the second half @-@ year .
Europe &apos;s biggest car @-@ buil@@ der can occur in the previous year , despite the many stamps , thanks to its many stamps and some well @-@ run markets further .
however , in July , the core brand was hon@@ ored especially in Western Europe , and thus loaded the overall sale as that included in the D@@ ax company .
the brand company sold the brand VW in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , the deliveries are increased by almost a hex@@ agons .
trad@@ emark manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ening numbers from July especially to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it has given a purchasing conditions in some nuclear markets . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British vote escap@@ ed out from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person in Turkey .
in the USA , where the exhaust pipes first , also stands on a min@@ us be@@ ech .
large stand for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , mainly on @-@ person domestic product is mainly rel@@ ayed by the diesel sc@@ and@@ al : after the first seven months , there is only one supplier of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles on be@@ ech .
group sales of the Fred Kap@@ pler joined the sales representative of January to July .
up to 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered in this period , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had man@@ ip@@ ulated with a software of gast@@ o@@ idal man@@ ipul@@ ates .
in Germany alone , VW is approximately 2.5 million car@@ ri@@ ages to repair the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , VW is that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
based on vehicles , it will give fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor performance .
the buil@@ der set the customer after the conversion a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not say from a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in the company &apos;s office .
reason are legal advis@@ es .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen grant his German customers now and guarantee a guarantee of the diesel models .
this would have been confirmed on the last Monday VW @-@ representatives at the Federal Ministry of Commerce .
from the traffic authority has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has carried out the support of my investig@@ ating Commission and its KBA customer &apos;s KBA customer . &quot;
&quot; variations of these are not accepted , &quot; explained the Federal Minister of Justice Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry of Justice .
VW has taken the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine capacity according to the conversion no det@@ eri@@ or@@ ations and all typ@@ ically approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not how it was in corporate travel .
the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; is the possibility to return an half year after the conversion around with a motor damage to a workshop - and that could lead to the new software , even though the damage caused nothing to do nothing .
in order to avoid too , it is important to avoid that there is nothing at any other damages not to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ and@@ al , according to an ind@@ isp@@ ens@@ ing , such as it was named .
therefore , do not use the term &quot; warranty &quot; not .
the Raiff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund on Teg@@ ern@@ see is required by rich econom@@ ists in the future , as a second Institute in Germany .
Bank chef Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; it is only about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day money . &quot;
the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see the signal : normal savings to pay &quot; not to pay for their savings . &quot;
Store money over night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , you must pay a 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires Raiff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund from September of private and company customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day money .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul .
he be@@ ware at the time of 40 million euros , which could be increased from one day on the other and could not be tested .
&quot; the bank account for me in the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; the banking manager said .
&quot; I can not place for any million euros . &quot;
the costs will continue to go further after the urs@@ ing principle .
the cash simply in the v@@ ault of Raiff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced a lot of four incid@@ ents , I don &apos;t want to leave the fifth ! &quot; he said the bank .
most customers have been understanding and changed to other investment forms .
just a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
the regional association Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme political course of the EC@@ B causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
they alone bear alone , &quot; is your business econom@@ ically not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with pro@@ secution of three million euros , the Th@@ ur@@ ing@@ ian People and Raiff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank @-@ branch 2014 head@@ lines had been made .
Michael Kem@@ mer , managing director of the bank of the Bank , said : &quot; we do not expect that private clients have to pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strongly . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said to give the Teg@@ ern@@ see &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el that is equipped with the fort@@ une of wealth . &quot;
&quot; this may be a small bank for the problem &quot; if they feed free money .
the G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and Teg@@ ern@@ see .

according to the Bayern regional association Bavaria &quot; there are no other banks known to calculate a mem@@ orial for deposits of private clients , &quot; said spokes@@ man in Ernst .
the President of the German Commercial banks and Raiffeisen banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared : &quot; the threshold , into a negative to go towards the private customers , is very very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and there is a hike from An@@ leg@@ ern to the competition .

Dest@@ ination Work : who bu@@ ys old vinyl records ?
unique men and middle ages in love .
before you come to the comments , order to over@@ hau@@ l him under the pseud@@ onym @-@ al@@ leg@@ ory men with smo@@ other si@@ ev@@ ap@@ ologies , this output guides you from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most significant re@@ inst@@ ation of sound plates do not want to sal@@ ute a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that sal@@ ute the re@@ vers@@ ities of physical objects , but to be due to Mid@@ life nost@@ alg@@ ia .
those who recently purchased a board , are all the anticip@@ ation of the age between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely applic@@ ant group .
it is also no hor@@ des due to Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has a emot@@ ional meaning : older turn@@ tables keeping its fe@@ el@@ ings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it &apos;s alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but you agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog is a news report on TV would follow me the camera would follow me in S@@ oho - a mod@@ est suit and wild ass , before I stand fast , my hands hold and something like : &quot; so , let us take a look at a look at the moment . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at a look .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly at his charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now fill in the building where once independent seller are , there are as a hand@@ ful of fantastic turn@@ tables .
I would like to ask the cam@@ eram@@ an , the camera for the next part , in which I stand in immediate vicinity of different men in such stores and try to watch their age and mood thanks to observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , to the Ray ( data count : two young women , three men mean age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data quantity : eight men mean age , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I have already looking forward , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels .
these sound plates , depic@@ ted above ( he sent me down the sn@@ ap@@ shot by email , I &apos;m not followed by home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he poss@@ esses a sol@@ ely si@@ z@@ able number of albums and sing@@ les , the result of his available income : it is now able to buy records as they were not able to purchase orders when he sold , when he was young and ple@@ dge .
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60s , early 70s , which had appeared as I was 11 or 12 . things I have to buy something too young to buy it , &quot; says he .
it is true that those who want to buy boards , rather than ver@@ ted , and add a lot alone time , and adds : &quot; I smoke , and I drink not much .
this is my L@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who is working at S@@ ister Ray , believes also that many customers that he meets , on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave to people that are influ@@ enced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eb@@ ack and let &apos;s see their old vinyl look again .
of the discussions that I have led , people usually have been part of their collection in 1998 , 1999 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy again their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom in a particular aging .
but what is the alleged emot@@ ional importance ?
it takes just a few seconds to see Ph@@ on@@ ica in order to recogn@@ ise that the turn@@ around is a so@@ othing community of equality .
according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel over@@ whel@@ med by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of tru@@ sted sound insulation , from objects to watch the happ@@ iness .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a empty or property material as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it is with many people so .
it &apos;s a simple way to emplo@@ y spiritual .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; a staff members of a plate stack .
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record for the last month , they have not yet heard .
the survey found out that 41 % have a record players who never use it , while 7 % of those who have one record , do not have a record players .
at that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I have a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pressed .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works at the sounds of the Uni@@ verse ( data count : three men middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ es &quot; of re@@ vi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; someone first came out here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ k@@ ead sound top , so that I may ask them at the shelf , &quot; says he says .
this is not a large percentage but it seems definitely .
more productive , less mus@@ i@@ kl@@ es .
we have people who say , &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which only slowly re@@ joined .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has an audience audience , when I clean .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos do , te@@ ens and women &apos;s medium @-@ age .
even if the atmosphere is less relax@@ ed as in the above stores - wild be@@ aver &apos;s latest synth@@ es@@ iz@@ ations and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ ter pop instead of experimental jazz re@@ conc@@ iled from the speakers - it is good to see such a di@@ vers@@ ität in the customer .
None of them looks different from them , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to be able if you stand to someone for 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , is running in business for a couple of minutes and considered the vari@@ ation of the sheets available for sale .
she is more man@@ ne@@ quin for a man@@ ne@@ quin .
she des@@ erv@@ es not much , therefore the plates of records no real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to a computer or any other way , but the beauty of discs is ... &quot; they drives with a des@@ ir@@ able sin@@ ning .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of record lovers have to be inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the order to re@@ alize the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I follow a group of young te@@ ens , that allows for a moment to buy a Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter to purchase a Cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
on the left a stair@@ case is a stair@@ case of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ e@@ house and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a blend of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody looks at - maybe , because they are only clean , some so far above that it is impossible to put them .
it is pure &quot; Disk Art . &quot;
but in relation that any attrac@@ tion for these items would mean more money for the industry , and some customers could leave the depths of So@@ h@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is beyond the luxury houses as panels .
even if my research results showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree they , at least in height , the great number of female collectors and record women who exist in reality , turn@@ around and in online .
these people work perfectly hard at school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the b@@ umm@@ ing of platform , Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records , while the st@@ ub@@ ble view of an in@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old wrong pres@@ enter , who ruled over the sh@@ oul@@ ders of nothing at the middle age .

French court ref@@ uses on demol@@ ition from shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp at the jung@@ le
a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of provis@@ or@@ ic shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees .
at a trial this week arg@@ um@@ ented the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be asked to sell 72 provis@@ ionally stores , in which individuals within the camp &apos;s goods , sell or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a couple of euros in t@@ orial restaurants .
pre@@ f@@ ecture Cal@@ ais gu@@ ar@@ gu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would be paid a parallel economy , which could not be paid out of a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups , the Court ren@@ dered that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that are offered by government supported un@@ ification and other groups , not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
they were also out that the mak@@ es@@ ian shops and restaurants often have been offering accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the use of people , who occup@@ ies the 72 provis@@ or@@ ic shops , but sp@@ ati@@ fied that the concerns of pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; can be absolutely retro@@ fit . &quot;
the Jud@@ ge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food shops , caf@@ es and restaurants would play a lot of larger than just people who live &quot; in extremely pre@@ mat@@ ched conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers are offering .
one of the places that was threatened by the Netherlands , the Jungle Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers , non@@ profit is run and 200 meals a day , English and French , as well as an ad@@ visory services for hundreds of protection , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ .000 people signed the pet@@ ition to maintain the Kids &apos; Café .

here comes the En@@ for@@ cement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers will be adjusted to the next generation speed range : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units are tested particularly effective .
the fut@@ u@@ rist@@ ic @-@ acting En@@ for@@ cement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accid@@ ents , where it was haz@@ ard@@ ous for a mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on the highway building or to san@@ itary bridges , there is often no necessary infrastructure to help there with a stationary board for maint@@ aining the speed limit .
a permanent mobile buil@@ der can be able to haz@@ ard@@ ous or man@@ eu@@ vr@@ able .
the En@@ for@@ cement trailer is Aut@@ ark : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrup@@ ted measuring operations five days , data be encrypted using a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously over several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit as well as from the time , driving train and vehicle class will also be aw@@ ak@@ ening .
in the high @-@ driven condition , one can move the pendant according to the manufacturer with any car .
in this way , it is not easy to cut in the measuring mode , so that the wheels are cut in the arm@@ oured and dis@@ appear wheels in the arm@@ our and by the way .
furthermore , it should protect a built @-@ in alarm system to protect v@@ ast@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the information of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities bl@@ ets with the new technology : recently , France has been 100 pieces following the last year , after a order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain re@@ covers silver in 7 @-@ piece Rug@@ by , re@@ covers Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in the Hand@@ ling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , back r@@ aps , line running and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of each color .
the defeat was bad@@ gered by the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ Award of the silver medal - Great Britain - and they could not be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck the New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back in the finals .
but in fact , Fi@@ ji would have been be@@ aten in this form a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a Tro@@ st - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least a Gold Medal to hang a gold medal about his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Ch@@ ef@@ er Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago , they lost under Ryan any game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they just lost only one .
this fl@@ ap will we@@ ep , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and dis@@ missed the attacks G@@ BS from sp@@ ass .
it was felt for the captain Tom Mitchell in and Co . , when would be run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when the sea Col@@ in@@ is@@ au took up in the corner .
at the time of four minutes , J@@ erry Tu@@ w@@ ai put another attack on the right corner which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly have the ball .
a devast@@ ated T@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only recorded fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua entered the right corner a tou@@ ch@@ down and it stood at 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ ef and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou passed by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so , when Fi@@ ji was born in addition to play 7 , while the UK still has been har@@ vest@@ ed .
it is so too .
GB resulted in the basic changes to half @-@ time , and completed the fi@@ bre@@ ast@@ ical gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was running after a br@@ illi@@ ant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started a try for GB , made a tou@@ ching down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game ran long to the south ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin , whose fans flo@@ cks , flo@@ cks sch@@ emes and dance on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not hard to ad@@ m@@ ire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ bags with another attempt in recent seconds .
the pe@@ ac@@ re@@ ef captured the fi@@ j@@ is ar@@ gu@@ ed and sm@@ iled in the la@@ wn@@ s in the lawn .
earlier than that day , Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 years and Britain ur@@ ged South Africa in a cris@@ p match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke line with an impressive foot@@ board and scored a gate under the post@@ en in the second half .
a br@@ illi@@ an late Tac@@ kling von Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside teams , secured the winning - and therefore the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning passed by Str@@ ug@@ gle with the Cra@@ fts@@ man &apos;s Cancer Day
there is no emot@@ in@@ less gold as with these games and I want to be hot .
from the first stro@@ kes to the final , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present in the two star@@ b@@ old in succ@@ ession , the first women in the history of the British Sports , who laid a scale of such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolutely , all of you are un@@ locked , which is also an ex@@ empl@@ ary .
what we see are two br@@ illi@@ antly athlet@@ ic athl@@ ete , which refle@@ cts the surface with the eleg@@ ance of we@@ aker , refle@@ cts the way of the Tri@@ umph@@ al of Triumph .
behind every Gold in rowing , a Bat@@ a@@ illon was sent to con@@ sent to which make the difference and it was no hair@@ y as the trainer , which would not sur@@ vive this day when it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able is , and they did so .
if you do not do that , he sp@@ read@@ eth everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it has changed a bit to view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could be treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could begin the inter@@ ruption on a minimum , if it was the right term .
I needed money , therefore I had to go back soon .
it was a inc@@ enti@@ ve .
I was in hospital , and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet about a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
it begins it .
the rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it one more bigger .
in the in@@ it@@ eness of the victory , their first thoughts went on Williams , who spent a nerv@@ ous morning to speak somewhat more than else and thus tried to work his own fe@@ ars .
St@@ anning who was in use as captain in the Royal Art@@ illery reg@@ iment in an application in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emot@@ ional wre@@ ck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means a lot . &quot;
it is repeated only how much me this means how much I and Helen and also have been working .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I would have to have a better person for exercis@@ ing or a better Trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the pair had a har@@ ten rhyth@@ m , with which their opp@@ onents could not be able .
even during the last 500 metres , when the teams came from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very pleased .
Helen called &quot; ab@@ b in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to be taken away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something .
we wanted to stand no fire@@ works , we wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before it will make decisions over his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding on a wedding , her own with the TV ad@@ vent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now it wants to enjoy the moment .
I would not say that this was my last race .
that could have much pressure means .
in London it took about six months to re@@ alize that I am a Olympi@@ ad winner .
it was all so new for me and I was so stri@@ pped .
it took about four minutes .
this fe@@ els better , so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , hon@@ est@@ ly for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ einer Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes to retirement .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian @-@ far . &quot;
a tiny water @-@ purpose pot@@ able water @-@ purpose unit as a model for the big water producers .
it was so named some time at the Tra@@ on &apos;s part in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a few later , the Water Forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken found the Zwe@@ ck@@ association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ Group applied &quot; Bavarian as a demonstration . &quot;
behind all the Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , which was 31 years in the two @-@ year @-@ association staff , including 28 years as managing director .
at the age of 65 , he was retired from the retirement age 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose unit with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , transported annually about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplies to 32 villages and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants .
member churches are the con@@ greg@@ ations of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
there are water supplies for further cities and municip@@ alities .
the current Ch@@ air@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns civil mei@@ ster@@ in Gertrud Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remember@@ ed that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was founded in 1985 as a water@@ ke@@ eper and was appointed Managing Director of the Zwe@@ ck@@ Association .
&quot; its tasks have been very varied and they were scattered from the water management and organis@@ ational activities , the budget planning , calculation of charges and contributions to the weekends , &quot; said the ch@@ air@@ woman .
as an outstanding events , she called the commission@@ ing and inaugur@@ ation of the new foun@@ tains ( 1994 ) , building stock in the area of the new foun@@ tains ( 1999 ) , the re@@ placing of a central computer control ( 1999 ) , re@@ vers@@ ations of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the ren@@ ew of water lines .
I have not given any bre@@ ast@@ eries and I have been recorded again , because water lives and pot@@ able water to be the most important foods .
in her ar@@ atio lo@@ dged , they prev@@ ented G@@ öl@@ lers , reliable and correct ministry over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as it would be his own company .
prior to a few weeks , he regarded as a real pract@@ ition@@ er of the successful concept of the V@@ eit@@ s group to the nit@@ rate of the surface of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
so he received much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ well attended the water @-@ wart Alf@@ ons Grie@@ bel who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ station and he was a reality .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his perspective , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the Rest@@ oration of the Zwe@@ ck@@ Association .
the greatest challenge and most difficult use were the sl@@ ump in high reserv@@ oir at the church of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on 3rd January .
at minus 17 degrees , the whole night had to work through at minus 17 degrees , that they could be supplied with water .
the power supply of Neu@@ brunn , you only have an exciting , because you filled the high reserv@@ oir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with stro@@ kes .
the management of the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , which occurs the follow @-@ up of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

when the disease was known with her son , they believed that they die .
meanwhile , the twenty @-@ year old Ti@@ ago has arrived well and come to be private in New York , where it will give the best therapy .

steel - Light Review for German St@@ ah@@ lin@@ industry
the crisis @-@ explo@@ ded and energy @-@ saving German St@@ ah@@ lin@@ Industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in milli@@ on@@ en@@ heights .
financial st@@ ress@@ ors that are threat@@ ening the sector from the eco @-@ current funding , are subject to the table from the table .
it remains at the liberation of the renewable energi@@ es on the ingredients for the so @-@ called O@@ edi@@ cal production in the German St@@ ah@@ lin@@ ux industry , said Federal Minister for Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ german General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ bourg ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
according to the first of the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to use the gases from the high @-@ furn@@ ace for power consumption for their own consumption , to request K@@ asse .
according to the German industry , the support industry accounts for an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , it will give a fundamental sales of the European Commission to talks with the Comm@@ ission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators be replaced in steel works , f@@ all an EEG conversion of 20 percent .
but these will not be collected in the St@@ ah@@ lin@@ industry .
IG Metall welcomed the un@@ ification of Germany with the EU Commission for the O@@ wn @-@ generation .
in order to determine the status Quo &apos;s status is written .
this particular meaning has the successful spray of Gabriel for the St@@ ah@@ lin@@ industry .
&quot; in regard to our campaign &quot; steel is the future &quot; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; at the reform of the emissions trading , climate and employment targets are subject to &quot; , &quot; IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot;
since the financial crisis in Europe , the steel sector in Europe has been under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation became more than the world &apos;s world &apos;s largest product in China in view of we@@ aker demand mass@@ acres on the global market .
European manufacturer th@@ rows Chinese steel con@@ cer@@ emon@@ ies pri@@ cing .
during this spring , the situation has somewhat relax@@ ed .
for a show , In@@ fu@@ hr@@ ink oil on import @-@ steel effect , the economic pro@@ spects for China are going to go in China .
un@@ clear , as a sustainable the price is .
the German industry @-@ pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained on Thursday before the Thursday .
the prices would have been stag@@ n@@ ated .
the sector respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to concl@@ ude from individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ 000 people were employed in the German St@@ ah@@ lin@@ industry .
in July the German steel manufacturer remain unchanged in spite of increasing prices and increasing the orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced less than six percent of crude steel than in the previous year , as the business agreement was announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity delivered now back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year .
in the next months , the association expects an increasing order situation with an increasing output .
community , Spirit , Health : sing sen@@ iors good
the S@@ ingen has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girls , she was in the school choir as a teacher @-@ studying music , and today he s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; sing myself - emot@@ ionally and physical , &quot; she describes them .
after a sample they fe@@ els out , che@@ er@@ ful and a total of life , says them .
next , she does , in her health , and her spirit something good .
because S@@ ingen is equal to several per@@ spectives in a great ho@@ bby for sen@@ iors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler von der Deutsche Sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ liga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
regular social contacts can and maintain social contacts and maintain .
because frequently , social and familiar structures aged on , a ch@@ orus is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel k@@ ipp in her choir : &quot; to make sure to get to the others and learn to each other - a part of a special shape of collapse . &quot;
sing in the positive sense in the positive sense , we@@ ep H@@ ac@@ kler .
because they train a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever calls his lung regularly , that is not on the daily life as fast as the Pu@@ ste .
even though it &apos;s why to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is a optim@@ ale ho@@ bby .
on el@@ derly people , S@@ ingen often did a special effect , Ursula L@@ enz states of the sen@@ iors of the sen@@ iors organisations .
in the older generations , shared with a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time .
L@@ enz observed that the singing or listening of songs in older people many memories are often associated with positive feel of their youth .
through ly@@ rics and especially mel@@ o@@ dies are dem@@ enti@@ ced people in long lying events .
when singing is also a special performance , L@@ ingen is also declared a special performance .
at the same time , on their own voice and to focus on a pre@@ y rhyth@@ m and adjust the other sing@@ ers - this is a major cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people , who alone live alone , do not only need to focus on yourself .
another positive aspect is the recognition he rides through the singing in the choir , we@@ ep H@@ ac@@ kler .
a enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em grows by the singing in the choir .
themselves , if I have long for something , I will be better and aw@@ ake over me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to begin with the singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new ho@@ bby , should not hes@@ itate - even if he we@@ ep , little tal@@ ent to have , is L@@ enz .
one sounds not only - at 50 sing@@ ers people who he@@ ars , if a sound is going on ?
in search for the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors are various options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
someone s@@ ings out of the dist@@ ant circle at a Sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ choir , you can easily close .
many cities offer views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
whoever would like to sing in a church in a church , can turn right into the church or the church .
many Sen@@ i@@ or@@ ench@@ irs you can also find on the Internet .
whoever has no access to the Internet , can ask the family , friends or neigh@@ bo@@ urs around the Internet .
whoever l@@ ust has to sing , it should be sure to close a choir and bro@@ kers .
let the soul f@@ sing good and has something a little guy - this is true for every age .
cats are re@@ acting as a boy on a fri@@ day of the young animals
in Hanover , bi@@ ologists exam@@ ines the effect of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
on her surprise , the Mi@@ auen , also left the male , but stopped in the difference to the females always .
Female cats may recognize the des@@ ir@@ ation of cat &apos;s grave on the side of the babies .
they re@@ acting to ten percent faster on ar@@ ro@@ bi@@ b , who chose to mention themselves in large emergency , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
tom@@ cat does not re@@ act on the f@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always equal .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the ten@@ ants of less and heavily er@@ ted ma@@ iden for the males either un@@ perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by MH@@ H .
it is the first author of the study that was published at this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C E@@ vol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in an previous study the researchers had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ Schre@@ ie was distingu@@ ished with the help of their help .
a total of nine adult male K@@ ater and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were wat@@ ched by the MH@@ H .
they were played for a call of little ones , taken for three minutes from the puppies and the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings were separated .
at the other hand , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with cry of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for extinc@@ tion .
&quot; all the females even , even those who had no own off@@ spring had responded to the Schre@@ ie , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned back to the speaker , when this ru@@ ten of the very poor k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be born or evol@@ ve with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male re@@ acts ever &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on a baby girl .
there were also some studies show that women sens@@ iti@@ ate on inf@@ ants , quite as they were already mot@@ hers , or not reported the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Pod@@ ol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a soccer legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver has been issued an arrest warrant .
he is accused of being accused of a terrorist group .
an important football game was held for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the Arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ sk@@ is Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already in July , the government &apos;s negoti@@ ating dis@@ closures according to the collapse in July , the government , the daily life of standardi@@ zed should not be imp@@ aired .
but this is not true for those who susp@@ ected the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt by the coup .
it will not be done before the football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ k , the Pro@@ secution filed an arrest warrant .
consequently , in America , South America has been accused of a terrorist group with a terrorist group .
southern door should be the pendant of the Pre@@ dig@@ est Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup .
indeed , initially for 90 days , state status is still until October , in fact , this is the life of most Turks , but as good as no impact .
the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; Dem@@ ocracy &quot; on public places in the whole country has declared a pe@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for finishing .
the sports is - like the whole land - stored in the heart and the opponent &apos;s geo@@ des .
a particularly fans of the workers in Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are tradition@@ ally not tradition@@ ally to the friends of the President .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , however , fell dram@@ atically in view of dram@@ atic experience in the history , the strict inten@@ tion of military coup .
there are even the fans there - no matter whether you pro@@ poses the heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
it will definitely come back on Lukas Pod@@ ol@@ ski when playing poker winner .
in the past season , the Cologne presented its first season in the past season : with 17 gates and nine tem@@ plates in all compet@@ itions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against f@@ enn@@ er@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ er@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atik &quot; sho@@ ok him : &quot; he was the best of the space . &quot;
he completed the season on excellent way and secured his team to be secured .
thanks to Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season was a record winner for a record completion .
after the pre @-@ rounds K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; is too early in the Europe le@@ ague .
in the sweet@@ ener , it was only rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only possibility to win something .
&quot; that we have managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Pod@@ ol@@ ski .
the year was better for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who served with 26 se@@ asonal ff@@ ff@@ ers as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g Tor@@ sch@@ ütz@@ ö@@ nig to the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in this case the AC Florence was below the contract , and at Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , there were only a l@@ ent Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to return on the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; if Mario I want to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; Kick@@ er , club chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
however , that would have to be ready to ref@@ use to ref@@ use , to roughly one @-@ third of his at 7.5 million euros . Or@@ man clearly said : &quot; his content in Florence is not able to pay . &quot;

&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ent@@ ate bear the same manuscript , &quot; said Ar@@ me@@ eg@@ en@@ eral DA@@ NA@@ I Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Freit@@ as early before journalists .
&quot; we assume that it is a coordin@@ ated attack . &quot;
it was too early to get to be possible mot@@ ives - probably the de@@ eds of Muslim re@@ bels .
even Thai media wanted to recognize a patterns in the attacks which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ent@@ ate Muslim separ@@ atist@@ s in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , explained the assass@@ ination attempt in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age that limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok .
they rather go out of that the bom@@ bs of the prev@@ ail@@ ing military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities returned to the past days in the South of the country in the South of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places .
be un@@ clear , which group behind the fence range .
the police proved its officers in all the country , security in around the important government building , and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and children &apos;s quarter .
in Thailand there are always smaller Bom@@ b attacks , but they do not count towards tourists .

following the elev@@ ated bom@@ b explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs commen@@ ds the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage , to aff@@ ord the instructions of Thai security authorities .

the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum on a Constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
this sp@@ ati@@ al the military influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta b@@ oss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ CHA , the bom@@ bs had been an attempt to she@@ ar ch@@ aos , while the country is moving toward stability , impro@@ ving the country &apos;s business and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which brought in 2014 after a phase blo@@ ody un@@ rest the power , maint@@ ains himself , the Kingdom itself again led to stability and order .
however , the military did not succe@@ ed to get to the handle in the outside south of the country in the outside south of the country .
in the conflict more than 6500 people have been killed .
nearly one year ago there were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u camp , 20 people were killed - most of them tourists .
it was the blo@@ ody stop of the younger history of the land .
the rights &quot; identity Movement &quot; is wor@@ shipped to the Federal Office of Constitutional protection .
after several offices the constitu@@ tional compl@@ em@@ akers have set up the group under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; Ac@@ commod@@ ity &apos;s Attack points for the Freedom Party issues , &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin .
so , random Islamic Faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist mode .
therefore we observe the movement too .
the &quot; identity Movement &quot; is a group of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ a @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controll@@ able mass storage &quot; and &quot; los@@ ing its own identity through over@@ foreign identity . &quot;
Constitutional sch@@ üt@@ ter in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Th@@ ur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; already .
in this case , Ma@@ ate said his authority has travel@@ ed closely with the decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to re@@ cover their target group where she is , &quot; said the constitu@@ ent chef .
General attemp@@ ts to try them with you@@ end@@ ous language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ists as well as legal trem@@ end@@ ors .
this is not a beg@@ inner advertising for its own thing .
the prop@@ ag@@ anda should speak emot@@ ional engineering .
young people are due in particular way .
that is dangerous .
last , from several German states talked about contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; associations . &quot;
he did not eat this in@@ sights .
for the Constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type would not be relevant from a certain point .
it is coming to whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist are changes and so extrem@@ ist .
thus , if such persons can have the influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a look at the significant increase of just@@ if@@ ying off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ eating , he would not speak in this context .
but we &apos;ve found in the past years that it may be rectangular structures .
there was a group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be possible that further just@@ if@@ ers group@@ ings or inf@@ ants const@@ itute , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , plan against refugee camps or att@@ acking from other legal trem@@ bling mot@@ ifs .
but it is not recogni@@ z@@ able in a wide @-@ wide or more European control of right @-@ err@@ or@@ ism .
the previous groups were created on regional level , or social net@@ workers .
in particular , Ma@@ ate told them that many over@@ g@@ ps went on the account of people who had not occurred in the right scene in the sight .
this is the owner re@@ juven@@ ating .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crime , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or p@@ endants of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed stra@@ igh@@ ters , who had previously voted with legal trem@@ end@@ ously in the hat , who were perhaps polit@@ ically in@@ different or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Lin@@ ke , however , who have been ra@@ dic@@ alised with legal trem@@ end@@ ous mood . &quot;

the fees per cubic meters of waste water will be held on October 1 , 2016 for the area of the water@@ line Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ irche 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lind@@ enberg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase once again , if appropriate enh@@ ancement measures are necessary .
after a excess of lim@@ it@@ ulation , the Ab@@ water@@ fare in Az@@ endorf takes place at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meters .
as the may@@ or of Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the approval of households has been determined by the property with Kul@@ mb@@ ach , causing this waste water facilities .
due to just@@ ified foundations , the Cas@@ endorf market is oblig@@ ated to run the systems with costs .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ irche , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lind@@ enberg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg are to attack off the pur@@ se .
the increased increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed , a new kal@@ k@@ ulation of the charges for waste water systems are necessary .
during the period of October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - and under@@ covers from the previous cal@@ cul@@ ation period to balance .
the gra@@ ving increased level , Schmidt designed that it was relatively small facilities with a very low waste water , which fly between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
due to its low distribution base , expenditure for example , expenditure on necessary rep@@ airs of several thousand euros is gra@@ ined .
in addition , the waste water rise in all three systems .
furthermore , Kal@@ cul@@ ation period also occur in all three systems last due to their age @-@ related san@@ itation and repair expenses in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ irche , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lind@@ enberg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt dis@@ missed that in the water system Az@@ endorf st@@ ressed the mechanical tre@@ ating system because of poll@@ ut@@ ants .
in the pump &apos;s car body , which had to over@@ hau@@ led almost 20 years of old convey@@ or plants , and at the pond water plant L@@ opp had to be completed after almost 20 years of operation of the first sep@@ tic tank and to be installed in order to maintain the water legal provisions .
Schmidt : &quot; maint@@ aining this extraordinary expenses , the advanced and maintenance costs came to take into account in accordance with the new Kal@@ cul@@ ation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level during the previous year 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clearly that at its low waste water in the three systems , the expenditure on the operation and maintenance is fully tigh@@ tened . &quot;
in addition , Schmidt , the market gener@@ alisation of large entertainment costs have been spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to continue to continue by stone homes , mostly in the supply of the waste water @-@ purpose of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal this facilities cannot be extended because it is around def@@ iz@@ it@@ arian facilities .

military tribunal of the United States Central Command changed technical information to draw a optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it was the actual states of con@@ form to the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ lican commit@@ tees , secre@@ tion commit@@ tees and the Wehrmacht budget , reported by great importance under Central Command secre@@ tions under Central Command secre@@ tions under Central Command Secret Services .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News &quot; Information , which were sent by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com compos@@ itions , regularly , a positive image of the US efforts were allowed to have been permitted and were some positive as analy@@ ze of other new@@ ly@@ ric services , quoted a newspaper article published .
&quot; what will happen at Cent@@ Com , is acceptable for our soldiers , when bad analyses were presented to our political leaders , &quot; exhibited Ken Cal@@ vert , repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
leading error in Cent@@ Com range until the top end of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 into the descriptions and analyses of the American forces in the Iraqi forces .
even though there is no direct hin@@ ts to change the government tips and Obama instructions to change the reports , as an@@ alyst@@ s were exposed to their predecess@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , comments and statements before the Congress correspon@@ d significantly as it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
for example , an Cent@@ Com members announced that a military return of Muslims had already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second city of Iraq , remains under control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investig@@ ations , it is so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Congress of Kansas , in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 until the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of Central Command was changed to present the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after having decided that an@@ alyst@@ s had wor@@ shipped within the man@@ ip@@ ulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday published by detailed findings , will be completed during investig@@ ations .
in addition , additional investig@@ ations of Cent@@ Com reports are supported by the Secretary of Defence in the G@@ liers .
Democratic members of the For@@ endi@@ enst@@ ek@@ om@@ it@@ tees published their own in@@ sights , with some of the concl@@ usions of the repub@@ lican Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com impro@@ ving an over@@ limited process for creation of retro@@ spective ass@@ ess@@ ments to I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi Security Studies , &quot; gave the highest request of Dem@@ oc@@ rat , Adam B. ship , in a statement .
this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; del@@ ayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; damage the mur@@ al under an@@ alyst@@ s and &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence on an inter@@ v@@ ene of the turn@@ out of the Cent@@ Com an@@ alyst@@ s regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; on Tuesday .
last August , the New York Times was reported by investig@@ ations by the Pentagon told by Cent@@ Com an@@ alyst@@ s .
Lt@@ . C@@ md@@ r. Patrick Evans , a press spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , issued a statement on the Defence Ministry , during the investig@@ ations of the General In@@ spec@@ tion .
but he also said that &quot; experts were sometimes from di@@ verg@@ ent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and the news services and the Ministry of Defence has welcomed a contro@@ versi@@ al discussion of this important topics of national defence . &quot;
the investig@@ ations have followed response to the question of a successful air campaign under amer@@ ican leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion that has been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the acc@@ us@@ ations of the last year , however , President Obama administration on the Central Command for hon@@ est evalu@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the critic@@ ism of the secret state of the Islamic State remin@@ ds of more than ten years ago , as an Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a writer of many an@@ alyst@@ s only a small occup@@ ying troops in Iraq and a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the ins@@ urrection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team qualified by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to the government government states that the government would have no significant effects on the financial situation of the terror group because these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
this knowledge was not published but reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s was the commander of the commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Leg@@ isl@@ ative Dec@@ ision to his superior results of the war situation in front of the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel during the Central Command .
the US win four consecutive match in the ho@@ ckey match of women , a show down with the UK before
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American military ho@@ ckey team of women in a match against India that Americans won the US with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games are supposed to be a mem@@ orable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , it could not remember to remember that ever .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t listen to people who keep their gates in memory .
the white they however , however , are : the Americans are staying at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and they are un@@ defeated at the British in their first place , which remains unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide that the two teams will compete in the first and second place in their group .
the first @-@ placed becomes the strong Holl@@ ands slightly longer from the way to run the other group .
like the game on Saturday , Americans are trig@@ gered by their success story by their success story , four years after the past London Games took over the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this teams .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became national leader of the USA , most recent in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they didn &apos;t qualif@@ y for the c@@ ader .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team got everything .
in the subsequent year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; a cultural change , an mental change and physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the emplo@@ yer in London , which we now have .
we can ri@@ p the rud@@ der completely .
on the morning night , B@@ am opened the Torre@@ y in the first half of the game with a return of se@@ aside .
India had gone without victory in the tournament , but the team went sur@@ pris@@ ingly , and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until the game was put into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball on the left face , then moved into the middle and invited the ball into the gate around the American a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Melissa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ u@@ tout was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to be@@ ware of each goal in each of the previous games .
she has a running .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will dep@@ end on Saturday the result of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the m@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wher@@ ever you are too , as late as it is too late , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro is nic@@ ely durable and permanently soft , an la@@ wn@@ y race between competition and brac@@ es .
it is when the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning staff , which is intended for tri@@ athletes born to the tri@@ athletes .
you can not switch on TV , a paper read or during the discussion of your neigh@@ bo@@ urs in the Wart@@ sil@@ ica , without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ op@@ y or the disp@@ ute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and Ch@@ ad le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who plays for the first time at the Olympic Games and a lady of white with dimples , could have been carried out under these well @-@ known names , which would be sent to Prime Time , built by spon@@ s@@ ors and well @-@ feeling TV commercial , if it would be a sw@@ imm@@ ers , Turner or even fe@@ eder .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting for the olymp@@ ic be@@ aten gold .
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow , the sports species , which are not generally acknowle@@ dged : aerial hill shoot , Archery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and do it long .
but when I wanted to make arg@@ uments for my certain song , then let me leave the attention on the dis@@ cre@@ et charm of tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tr@@ amp has already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been a Olympic event in Sydney , it was the last 16 years that many of whom I had asked , did not know that there is at any ever an Olympic Port .
this could also be regional Ig@@ al .
although the USA Ath@@ l@@ ete again sent a medal in the tr@@ amp division and made up a athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it until the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians are to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women to divide the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will def@@ end their gold medal from London .
the tramp@@ ol@@ ine jump has a certain outdoor side , partly because it sounds easy for an un@@ solved ear to a C@@ low@@ ns@@ schule when responsible for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I was no idea , but only a d@@ geb@@ unden@@ er enthusi@@ ast bin .
it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling - but also the Gra@@ zie of Turn@@ ens and dives that combines two sports , which un@@ ites it essenti@@ ally .
the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; was written by the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , meaning as much as &quot; Jump@@ ing board . &quot;
emerging vic@@ tori@@ ous winner jump almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a number of falling movements ( shooting , he@@ aters and salad ) before leaving the feet .
they will be rated according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram to execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flying time . &quot;
two female athletes of 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in the Rio each other .
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their route to gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes up and back , to the top and down@@ wards on the playground .
they do not only pay the finishing line , but in the TV transmission , but in the TV transmission is another target : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ om .
the targeted sp@@ reads is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red food , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to bring up a audience to te@@ ars .
but it is also that what I feel themselves to watch this games as something ti@@ reless .
of this , the tramp@@ oline offers an At@@ ten@@ tion .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ spr@@ ing@@ ers is the top .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ t down , se@@ em@@ ingly heavy like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes back to the top , then moved back to the top .
also here is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no v@@ ault into the distance , elegant up@@ lift of time and grav@@ ity .
it is so Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
qualifying and final stages of women are held on Friday afternoon in the stre@@ aming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men start on Saturday , around 13.00 .
N@@ BC is cru@@ cial as part of a afternoon card on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably looked at the general tum@@ ult .
if the awar@@ eness could only be achieved by att@@ ack@@ ers and the object @-@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - like it sm@@ ote the male US @-@ Turner according to The Wall Street Journal in front of the The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his turn to the new fan .
&quot; a generation Protest@@ ant &quot; in Ethiop@@ ia , Long &apos;s ally and the USA
violent prot@@ ests in Ethiop@@ ia
demonstr@@ ators that require political changes in Ethiop@@ ia , threw down the government of the government .
witnesses say that only zig protest@@ ers were killed during clas@@ ps with the police killed .
is Ethiop@@ ia just going together ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a sturdy ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months , prot@@ ests against the government occupied the country and far more areas .
last week thousands of people embar@@ ked on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government was in@@ bar@@ gain .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot and killed protest@@ ers and killed .
in circulation , more than the prot@@ ests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security sle@@ ek young people with bul@@ ls , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the Chief of Human Rights on Human Rights demands a in@@ coming research .
&quot; it was always difficult to maintain this country and to future it is even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiop@@ ia is the most pop@@ ulated country in Africa and its stability is estimated to be the west .
American military and intelligence service works closely with the Ethiop@@ ian , in order to fight terrorism , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , when it is at all , so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ia economy expanded in particular pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ st@@ ically improved - there is a new Pen@@ dl@@ er@@ ator in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually calm , safe and clean .
even if Ethiop@@ ia had all other as an example of democracy - human rights organisations ongoing the repres@@ sion by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dis@@ sidents were brought into silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , or were driven into the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and press these no other options , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ la , a lec@@ turer in central Ethiop@@ ia .
the entire youth protest@@ ant .
a generation Protest@@ ant .
there are numerous compl@@ aints that cover everything from the soil use to dig@@ n@@ ity with regard to power of the govern@@ ed co@@ alition .
following a far @-@ ranking critical election last year , the reg@@ aining party and its allies gain the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time the ten@@ sions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this z@@ ack@@ y , contro@@ versi@@ al line required in June hundreds of life .
analy@@ st fe@@ ared that separ@@ atist@@ s like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Og@@ aden , which were more or less comp@@ ute into recent years , that could re@@ bu@@ ked more or less .
several factors explain why fe@@ el@@ ings of the fe@@ eding after years ago is now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smart phones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ian were able to communic@@ ate by the social media , as the cheapest smart@@ phones are more frequently more frequently and improved the Internet services .
even if the government shut access to Facebook and Twitter closed what they do in regular intervals , especially with prot@@ ests , do many people still communic@@ ate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that they hide themselves .
several young Ethiop@@ ian saw that she met at the prot@@ ests .
the second factor is that there is more soli@@ dar@@ ity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ylene in Ethiop@@ ia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since Eth@@ ics , the Am@@ har@@ as , which are mainly coming from Ethiop@@ ia , mainly in politics and economy , while they explo@@ ited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and in flat areas .
but it does not change that .
&quot; we are able to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos .
the largest prot@@ ests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiop@@ ia is un@@ fair@@ ly domin@@ ant of members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and domin@@ ate in the military , in the intelligence service , in trading and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ publication illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiop@@ ia prime minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who think about corners .
an@@ alyst@@ s say that he was particularly con@@ fin@@ ed in it , to use the early mark of un@@ satisfaction and the Special Repres@@ entative to ass@@ ess opp@@ onents and they are harm@@ ful to make their opp@@ onents .
&quot; the current regime is lack@@ ing in this fundamental taste , Lord Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiop@@ ia new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected as relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiop@@ ia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
analy@@ st say that he did not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood @-@ shed .
the last time that Ethiop@@ ia lived such a tum@@ ult in 2005 , after thousands of elections , according to the analysis of analy@@ tics , appar@@ ently committed by the government and subsequently were st@@ olen .
while the following radar were killed many protest@@ ers , even if there were less than in the last months , and that time of un@@ rest went quickly over .
foreign experts pra@@ ised Ethiop@@ ian leader for its vision@@ ary infrastructure project , such as the new Pen@@ dl@@ er@@ ator , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in the poverty line .
but obviously , this does not affect the intensive mis@@ use of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month of print protest@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , of Tig@@ ray guided establ@@ ish@@ ments and hat@@ red to the Tig@@ ray gets more common in the social media .
analy@@ st say that the prot@@ ests against the USA and other West allies bring to a strange position .
the American government used Ethiop@@ ia as the basis for Dr@@ on@@ en@@ ough@@ s on the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , even though they recently announced that it has closed this basis .
during the West , Dem@@ ocracy wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to break his ally in a whole area .
&quot; this , &quot; Lord Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declared his asser@@ tion Obama at IS@@ IS , was &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attemp@@ ted to scatter on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y that his campaign took part , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terror group of Islamic State , not serious .
this clar@@ if@@ ying failed to communic@@ ate new issues of the presidential candidate from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans whether it is able to communic@@ ate with the American public .
it also brings together his fellow cont@@ ing@@ ites , taking it during a refresh@@ ing phase in protection to the actual position to say that he could not have been meant .
after having made the acceptance of a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump has made reference to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and existed in interviews on Thursday that he was really not intended to signi@@ fying President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was just stra@@ igh@@ ted .
the Twe@@ et was the contrary to the previous day , at which Mr. Tr@@ ump in a number of interviews said he meant the effort to be made perfect .
when the conservative radio pres@@ enter Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to destroy the testimony that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the repub@@ lican Pre@@ sidency would not know it .
the last storm of critic@@ ism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ es on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to try the focus of his campaign because of the economic situation in the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held data in Mich@@ ig@@ an in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics suggest@@ ions to higher taxes , and that he had found their speech bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already killed Sar@@ kas@@ mus in his defense .
in late July , he moved to critic@@ ism of critic@@ ism , when he thought that Rus@@ sians should have Mrs. Clin@@ ics En@@ tran@@ s , but explained later &quot; Natural I said . &quot;
this method allows to move Mr. Tr@@ ump into the l@@ ingu@@ istic borders in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods , such as certain Emb@@ as@@ si@@ es of his fans will be taken , such as they come , and then interpre@@ ted &quot; clear &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who contributed to the language of the candidate .
but I also , he is cle@@ ver enough to keep his statements to keep enough , so that they can be interpre@@ ted on different species and way .
instead of the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted a still cor@@ ro@@ b , since its environmental values have gone back .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a big lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally attemp@@ ted to ap@@ olog@@ ize himself for its prov@@ oc@@ ative majority , he charged his crit@@ ics , his statements , or his hum@@ or false .
but while he strengthened himself in the focus of the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze have brought his loy@@ al participation in the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of what prov@@ oc@@ ate his statements also .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former may@@ or of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps and ear@@ liest prin@@ cip@@ alities , he gave great effort to def@@ end the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; I believe what he is leg@@ itim@@ ate , political Comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was question@@ ed about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State .
it is true that Obama has been an almost unknown , small organization , he called his back@@ b@@ ors , totally wrong and des@@ erv@@ edly because he passed the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ instre@@ am Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government used under Obama , Mrs. Clinton used in Mrs. Clinton as an Secretary Minister , IS@@ IS permit to spread out the situation in the Middle East .
prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them up , on every one of his words , and against him vo@@ iced .
he de@@ fied the poor , poor &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot;
some of the Democrats talked about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as a further evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the pre@@ sidency .
once more about the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you only allowed to pay Wi @-@ Fi that was not a good coffee for 15 years .
of course , it was p@@ ushed by the prices of his Bedford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s shop , set up in summer 2014 , sells soap in form of Cup@@ cakes .
native domestic violence as the last loss in a st@@ rif@@ ying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and b is now a soap . &quot;
but when New York &apos;s change is , it is also re@@ productive .
a revi@@ val Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still some of the same people and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ term employee of the old caf@@ es , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ es .
he began to work with ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered a client for a new exterior , he was exc@@ ited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the excav@@ ation bought the same es@@ pres@@ siv@@ ity model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experim@@ ent with her .
he introduced the new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and auti@@ stic onions .
there is natural re@@ iss@@ ations .
the café serves no beer more , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez told that he noticed a st@@ ole electricity to old family clients .
&quot; many old clients were also p@@ ushed through prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was an such customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after Green@@ point was drawn , it would take the way up .
after the locked there was closed , she gave up a while , she said .
&quot; I was clear that it was on coffee and culture in the ver@@ b , which was right to me , &quot; she said .
now drinking a coffee , even if they reached on this day in the usual I@@ ced coffee , a bl@@ ended Ch@@ ai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ term and true customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and proved un@@ mist@@ ak@@ ly in the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day as a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experim@@ enting with new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets still his common order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he didn &apos;t re@@ gre@@ et , that the soap has taken the old business room .
indeed , the owner of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie was to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold burned coffee of the caf@@ és .
&quot; I think we will continue to go on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated into Polish Finnish and Rodri@@ guez , he said that he will be able to announce her new neigh@@ bo@@ urs , so that his new neigh@@ bo@@ urs will welcome you .
the location has also further extrac@@ ts .
a local saf@@ t@@ loc@@ ally want to fill the cold fried coffee into the bottles and for sale .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to al@@ loc@@ ate building .
for many customers , a new for@@ b is enough to get their old fav@@ or@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ umph@@ ed and told that he was destroyed on the ground when the café lock .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bed of the location and the fun@@ eral of a new coffee is felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to sm@@ ell the sm@@ ell , &quot; he said .
the primary food of the economic crisis in &quot; an en@@ ri@@ ble meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano took hold on lunch in the Oval Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker had President Roosevelt in Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen at Fifth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tie soup .
the menu on this day was somewhat mod@@ est : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ ums p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of cul@@ inary soli@@ dar@@ ity with children , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both of the food hist@@ orian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was a hand@@ led by the Chinese cuisine in the USA during bri@@ cks in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the Food Per@@ spective .
their latest cooperation , &quot; A permanent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at the Har@@ per publishing house , illustrated the history of American cuisine during the Great Dep@@ ression .
they showed cul@@ inary soli@@ dar@@ ity when they meet with a rep@@ orter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop on supp@@ er , a small , schn@@ au@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ b@@ ite in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock of Bör@@ s@@ enc@@ r@@ ash in 1929 .
Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables .
when the rep@@ orter of h@@ asted , this was found the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Dep@@ ression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said C@@ ens@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver lo@@ af and bean bread .
they were prepared from al@@ location and a little cheap which access the ingre@@ dient .
imagine how many earth may eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; it must have laid in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Dep@@ ression , the table was in a American budget , especially in rural areas , all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male military workers and it was served fresh past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the American citizens to be hun@@ gry for the first world of World War . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; dra@@ ws the way up , with which the country had to be destroyed , no more the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ en@@ land .
&quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central theme , there was a central theme , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
the same reason was the new budget : myst@@ eri@@ ous meals like Br@@ ote and Cass@@ er@@ olls were able to re@@ alize the cass@@ er@@ olls as a &quot; wonderful kind , Es@@ sens@@ re@@ ste , &quot; understood Z@@ iegel@@ man to hide the un@@ appet@@ ite ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry ob@@ st .
meat that was a lon@@ gl@@ asting of the centre of the American cuisine , was in a rare luxury .
specifically designed mix@@ tures , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ished satisfaction was prec@@ ed@@ ented or even healthy kitchen .
during their research on the book , which comprises recipes , he prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , re@@ fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions are not sliced each other .
it was typical for many of the laundry recipes .
as had never before , the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , among them Louise Stan@@ ley , director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating hab@@ its of the country .
by doing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encour@@ aged women to become &quot; domestic don@@ ations &quot; and the challenge , p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic L@@ eck@@ er@@ b@@ sen .
in particular , the reports about the answer of the government to the hun@@ gry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me cakes and food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly presented the simple I@@ owa farm@@ houses in his kitchen , he spoke the same as the milli@@ on@@ th major man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he lik@@ ed continental cuisine as fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a fine dining room , and carried a smo@@ king .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful real@@ m .
President Roosevelt would have committed the same mist@@ akes that if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have been asked him to static with his stomach .
as described in the book a hous@@ ekeeper with no interest in taste of taste through Mr@@ s Roosevelt , that the White House produced the bor@@ ing food in Washington , but also one of the most tro@@ ug@@ ly prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Dep@@ ression with eating , was dis@@ card@@ ed when the country was back to the legs .
the powers on our continued focus on calories and food , it was bri@@ ck@@ ering , as well as science on food .
the couple agreed on when writing the eating hab@@ its of Z@@ ip@@ mans @-@ law @-@ in @-@ law @-@ law - for example as they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the dis@@ appearance of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ man remember@@ ed : &quot; she was actually sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ shiel@@ ding fall .

Greenland : the oldest ver@@ te@@ br@@ ine is almost 400 years old
more rare view .
Greenland hair usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was moved to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland Hair dr@@ yers only got up with 150 years .
although the Greenland was flo@@ oded on the north of the North Atlantic in an hour , on average , average is 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only if it comes up , the five @-@ metre long animal speeds up to 2,6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
but this by long@@ itude of lon@@ el@@ iness seems , but a pat@@ ron concept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen , among the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of a Greenland , which could be 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; comment by Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for dem@@ ographic research in Rostock , this life span that means for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates a world record .
although the E@@ vol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist susp@@ ected that Greenland hair is being grown .
only the evidence is missing .
Greenland Hair @-@ shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , they live mainly in the Eis@@ meer in front of the thin defeat in the coast of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because it &apos;s temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , dive them in the surface usually only in winter .
about the lifestyle of the Greenland @-@ based scientists have been correspon@@ d@@ ingly to little .
her time stamp de@@ position she , when they were able to spend six animals in front of S@@ val@@ b@@ ard six animals .
be@@ ating this shar@@ ks yet : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had shot the pine bone of a young ice cream .
possibly they are sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and search in Ka@@ da@@ ver , which turns out of higher water tubes .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues turned 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ia , fisher@@ men between 2010 and 2013 , as co @-@ cat@@ ching from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the largest 502 @-@ centi@@ metre length was measured .
in order to determine the age of animals , they analy@@ zes them with the Carbon @-@ 14 method to the lens of shar@@ ks .
this Centre of the eye lens was created before the birth of Ha@@ ie , which contained in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in lens .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , as Atomic w@@ aff@@ en@@ for@@ ging larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon .
in conjunction with 220 centi@@ meters long , the lens of the lens contained a low over@@ head to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all bigger Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ia had ar@@ ises its carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts due to cos@@ mic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 493 @-@ centi@@ metre @-@ long Greenland &apos;s age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centi@@ meters would even be 392 years old .
that Greenland female became only off@@ spring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now , researchers have seen the length of an old age .
as one of the animals with 392 centi@@ meters , probably at the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature and his age was established with 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ia with the sur@@ ge obviously at least one and a half centuries .
even that could be the world record for Ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
that such meth@@ od@@ al@@ os live mainly in its icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland , whose neck was on the neck of an 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon Gun , was caught on Alaska .
through the low temperatures , the organ@@ ism of the animals live on as@@ par@@ as@@ ants .
so they re@@ eds later - and aging s@@ lower .
to keep in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume is growing , much faster than its surface planted by the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than in a gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it , as possible as possible as possible many desc@@ endants , explains the E@@ vol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist .
a very big animal should invest his resources in a long life .

&quot; it &apos;s very likely that Frankfurt most benef@@ ited from Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Compet@@ ence &apos;s financial markets and property markets of I@@ W .

Jewish film@@ maker strikes the Berlin Hotel in Berlin because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab . &quot; RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ touched a media rest@@ ation after he had betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in Berlin , as there were no Israeli guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ ex@@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; sent his trou@@ bles at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to find Israel on the country &apos;s list selection list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel are elim@@ inated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si offers Bristol a way to choose Israel over an own call center .
after a statement , the director is due to the hotel &apos;s conc@@ eption .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel was said that the measure had a &quot; cle@@ ver decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director even more .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they demanded that the pre@@ fix will be deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was c@@ ited .
the Israeli am@@ bassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we stayed from this event and cr@@ ashes .
this is really exciting .
the fact that this is in Germany in exactly this hotel chain has even greater shame .
no explanation need .
we expect the hotel &quot; the right concl@@ usions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incid@@ ents rede@@ emed a pretty great res@@ on@@ ance on the Internet , when the people called a sc@@ and@@ al .
some sub@@ jected to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , announced that there would have been part of the alleged sub@@ mission of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t know , &quot; it was pointed out in another contribution , where it was pointed out that the hotel is located on the no@@ bles Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly all the acc@@ us@@ ations of himself and called the incid@@ ent a &quot; see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ize &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not include the high @-@ level list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ person for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
there adds to that the country code was added to the country code .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increased to 71 % - RT Business
according to the sanctions , according to the Russian am@@ bassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an grew by 7@@ 0,9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been raised , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , the am@@ bassador allowed to am@@ bassador .
Russian companies take existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to create access to the market .
of course , the further commercial construction is one of the biggest pri@@ orities of bil@@ ateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
in the first five months of 2016 , it noted that the trade exchange rate between Russia and Iran had risen by 7@@ 0,9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and to $ 856 million in the same period .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1,5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade up@@ swing was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the am@@ bassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of I@@ ran@@ ian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian foreign Repres@@ entation issued approximately 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily in the first travel Agency , an I@@ ran@@ ian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries to aff@@ ecting the tourism in Russia .
one could say that the record number of Irish tourists will be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Rus@@ sians also visit Iran , something that will hope to change the am@@ bassador .
&quot; I personally can visit the visit of the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d , the mon@@ uments of the old Per@@ sian civ@@ il@@ ization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

scar@@ let Call@@ um sc@@ rub at home , as Brit@@ on gold for professional use
Schott@@ mann Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in the Vel@@ od@@ rome in Rio at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to the f@@ ame , as the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow participated the anch@@ or@@ man who had made his country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend , when he stor@@ med his home to take a win of the fav@@ or@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed one of four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
she repeated the tri@@ ck after it took place in March at the London World Championships in London despite the back@@ bone Ho@@ ys only a mod@@ est sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver &apos;s Jamie staff .
they did this right in time as a round .
Ho@@ ys re@@ tire a gap who tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man that she remained , when they saw the potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots who has now un@@ fol@@ ds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner participated in the qualifying rounds of the Olympi@@ ah@@ ek@@ ord , but in the first round the New Zealand will conqu@@ ered the New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ ell with gold .
after his round , after his round , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and the inner part .
a strategy change made a great part of transformation , with the exec@@ utions in a higher gear to slow it , and to enable him to hold the pace .
Ho@@ y looked up from his position as BBC @-@ expert , and fell sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they had increased to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a real comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just un@@ belie@@ vable .
there is no better way to win .
after the tri@@ umph in 2012 , Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave it to that he fell off after a weak start .
he returned to this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England Riv@@ als .
this time there was no problem with such incid@@ ent victory there .
Hin@@ ds said : &quot; it fe@@ els all the GB fl@@ ags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we have joined our team in the last three months .
we are so bad that many world records so bad that it was incredi@@ bly to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won seven of 10 titles in Beijing as well as London .
if that &apos;s a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the area of real@@ m that he repeated Ho@@ ys Vic@@ tory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
this would be younger than 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 , was also born on March 23 ( an appar@@ ently most holy date for the British Sports ; also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the be@@ ading of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y will be part in the Sprint , which begins today and will go through three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
it can win with his colleagues .
it fe@@ els something to win , alone .
one said , &quot; When he won two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the kn@@ ight . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day but there was another good news for England .
Sir Brad@@ ly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilomet@@ re circuit .
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 942 on the destination .
the world record , which won in 2012 in London was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , which will stand on the W@@ ig@@ gins .
he had yesterday the qualification before the qualification before qualifying , when he had to measure him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding contest , the tomorrow is continuing and ended , av@@ anc@@ ers Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Arch@@ i@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team leaves his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a ch@@ ar on medals .
after a truly exceptional picture of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations were shut down for Rio .
it played dr@@ ama in the background , as the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in ap@@ id@@ st of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and Mo@@ bb@@ ing@@ fen , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pen@@ dl@@ eton .
however , when you can see the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like that the legendary call of G@@ BS , who has reached its cli@@ max at the perfect moment .
future of the m@@ elt of Portland due to abol@@ ition of the energy decline
the future of aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations - stand on the game , since the system oper@@ ators announced the energy process , and in order to bring all the deliveries to supply the energy company .
this step per@@ sec@@ uted the decision of the government in Victoria in early this year , no further sub@@ si@@ dies to operate the plant .
one for 20 years of fest@@ ival@@ time runs in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Alco@@ a in Portland stand on the game .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - might be end@@ ang@@ ered at a closing time .
in addition , it could be led to domin@@ ate effects , since the m@@ elt were consumed around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 , Alco@@ a led the Point Henry melting , which led the last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melting of Alco@@ a in Portland loses money and ris@@ k@@ le a closing time .
this step follows the lon@@ gl@@ asting spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian Dollars and last due to the current price for the system .
AG@@ L , which makes the great aluminium mel@@ ted with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , that three further owners will be announced its contracts .
the plant is located in the majority own@@ ership of a joint venture of Alco@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L goes out of that the plant has been operated in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the m@@ elt , the company divided into the company .
AG@@ L said to continue to have the contracts &apos; secur@@ ing business , &quot; which should have been in effect from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month cancellation period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; of so , AG@@ L is of which the contracts for the financial year 17 will be contri@@ bute to the revenue , &quot; said the power supplier .
all potential imp@@ acts on AG@@ L starting from the F@@ Y 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong sched@@ ules of wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L divided the value of contracts already in the amount of $ 187 million in the anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to go contracts to operate the &quot; ability of Alco@@ as ... the melting of the melting of which does not affect the melting of the melting .
the U.S. company said that it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have been able to enter into force from November this year , even if there is a explanation of the contract .
analy@@ st were war@@ ned due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closing of the Portland pol@@ lin@@ ens in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements , the head of Oper@@ ations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland annually consume about 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ watts .
if both plants were dis@@ appear from the market , it would mean a substantial decrease of demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as an electricity generation he would not be , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Re@@ ality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the father and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Cl@@ ans K@@ ris is on the cover of the prestigious Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand am@@ bassador for E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room full of people who I love , brought me the view of this Co@@ vers to W@@ an , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unve@@ iling of the Co@@ vers per@@ sec@@ uted a bi@@ z@@ arre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an em@@ ails and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ ast ) as she is the cover of her sister and ends with a classic wh@@ ales : you have planned all a sur@@ pris@@ m .
this makes the cle@@ ee@@ ee@@ al hand of a child &apos;s birthday ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You would have forgotten you ? &quot; ) , with the hon@@ esty of an animation on a slot ( at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but K@@ ris had to leave their other girls some@@ how to participate in this pub@@ licity .
with regard to the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vog@@ ue , with regard to security a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes her what the Vog@@ ue Cover is be@@ aten , be@@ aten ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West came to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the magazine is a League for himself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ edition is for Vog@@ ue , most of the most common edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that res@@ em@@ bles a picture of a sculp@@ tor as a fashion magazine , attrac@@ ts the issue a large number of advertising volumes ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , on the 8@@ 32 pages of the woods , 615 pages advertising ) .
the unve@@ iling of his cover stars is expected to see that in the past two years , the magazine still crossed the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years there were more &quot; celebr@@ ities times that Mod@@ ules &quot; than &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Winner and Di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ ot@@ am@@ bassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga the honour had .
but even by the small chance that Ms. J@@ enner is described by the journal as the &quot; break@@ through model &quot; of its generation - under the former category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related with famous persons related or Re@@ ality Stars or youth from today , know how to know how to be a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything appears on matches ) .
they are really tal@@ ented women who distingu@@ ish itself in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course we don &apos;t like J@@ enn@@ ers success .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always un@@ sharpen@@ ed .
in June , the rust@@ y Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d , and called them &quot; the mist@@ resses of the eye . &quot;
these fe@@ el@@ ings bo@@ iled back when the message came with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut it seems to go to point on the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vog@@ ue Edition .
it is in the true sense of the Word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
you make advertising for your prim@@ ers by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters also sell pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
it sells its made images of C@@ ind@@ y CRA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the German magazine LOVE .
and in her leisure time she is seen in reality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably , to see her sister Ko@@ ur@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centres annually 160@@ .000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 the support of the country are exp@@ elled by common centres annually , while the branch of other inter@@ medi@@ ations are already transferred to transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land already three of five people - mostly older persons , immig@@ rants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar . they are looking for free legal consult@@ ancy and legal gu@@ ardi@@ ans .
legal services of the church , which are already over@@ explo@@ ited for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their federal agents .
the director of the community of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Union of commun@@ al centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a rising of the Federal Government would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal centres are chronic and fin@@ anced , which means thousands of people from major services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who for@@ sake violent relation@@ ships , people with un@@ explo@@ ited and ex@@ press@@ ant deb@@ ts , families who have dis@@ missed due to canc@@ ers - all these people have trouble legal form - all these people have not able to get the aid that they need .
the Federal Government will be short@@ ened by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of help need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to just@@ ify their legal problems without any help .
we call for the altern@@ ating state and federal secretary , as well as the Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , to re@@ med@@ itate this ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations , so that people may require the aid to just@@ ify their problems .
last year , the state government filled their support , funds for law@@ yers on the national average .
it is now at the time to watch the needs of community centres and their customer community , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : voting for the Länder elections : SPD and CD@@ U elections
among the elections in the Federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the regulations of the SPD and CD@@ U ( SPD ) .
this was representative of the opinion research institute of IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; Newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government co@@ alition could just be govern@@ ed in the north , this is not possible after the environment values in Berlin .
in both states the SPD would have the strongest party and would have a good chan@@ ces to continue to the government &apos;s head office .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern the SPD gained from 35,@@ 6 percent over five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party places only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is contro@@ versi@@ al between the left and the Af@@ D .
linen come to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 per cent on the first day .
despite slight losses , the Green has slightly increased by 6 per cent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again in the heavy duty day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not present every 3 percent each day .
by the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD in the survey was only risen to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they were still looking for the Gre@@ ens with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the first time at 14 percent .
by 5 percent , F@@ DP could hope to return an return , the pir@@ ates would be missed in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Comm@@ unic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Comm@@ unic@@ ator came onto the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer living a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost a half kilograms and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ er and bigger , it was therefore no good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite bus@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes which would be enough for about two selenium ies with high resolution .
now an iPhone is now shipping with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
the Nokia 9000 Comm@@ unic@@ ator was born exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a couple of euros you can purchase the devices still on the Internet , but they come from the stone time of the internet page .
20 years ago , the Comm@@ unic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the computer fair Ce@@ BIT in Hannover as a &quot; office in the West Coast . &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent to type number : SMS and em@@ ails were sent and received via fax was the Comm@@ unic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible to use HTML @-@ Browser , if you have slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop .
then they found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price is quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euro .
the average retail price of a smart phones in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
no one failed in August 1996 that Comm@@ unic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone @-@ era .
ever since then everything is different .
the smart phones are one success story if not for Nokia .
the Handy @-@ Division of Finn@@ s had an exceptional Des@@ aster , was finally sold to Microsoft and sold off to Microsoft .
the market is currently supplier , which came and all later than Nokia .
always and everywhere that today is for a lot of people everyday life today .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1.4 billion machines have been sold , based on Samsung and Apple of them alone 555 million pieces .
the global sales of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this is the well @-@ running business of the count@@ less app provider and telec@@ omm@@ unications company .
around the smartphone , around the smartphone has now emerged as a whole industry .
at the beginning of 2007 , the decisive break@@ through of the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World in the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three machines in one : a musical player , a telephone and an Internet communication , everything via touch screen is easy to use .
the victory of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry to be dominated by the market .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his in@@ vention .
at the cut , every German now has 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; we must all learn to form the smartphone even once again , &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens executive board for personnel .
this permanent sub@@ mission is now considered a curse and bl@@ ess@@ ings at the same time .
England have to expand the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only going into our local communities within London , but throughout the country of renewal and welfare .
for me , the largest attrac@@ tion He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we managed to make a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be back by He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s local and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we already have 10,000 new teachers , creating 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
so how they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the expansion He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games , and we will join us on the world stage .
two fl@@ yers were wrong in 2012 , and they will be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obst@@ acles to dis@@ appearance , but He@@ ath@@ row respon@@ ds to each other question .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for a infrastructure project .
extension is a possibility to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , create £ 211 billi@@ ons of wit@@ ty growth and a conf@@ usion of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in the whole GB .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion of infrastructure projects in time and budget , from T5 to the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport train terminal until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies which was built in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am conf@@ id@@ ent that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is also one .
it &apos;s time to expand this olymp@@ ic Spirit and He@@ ath@@ row , as well as our future trade , and create a powers of skills and jobs that can be proud of England .

ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; Set and mouse game &quot; regarding display block@@ ing
according to one of the software training , according to one of the software policy attemp@@ ts to perish , setting blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; at the same time .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block@@ ed indic@@ ations on his des@@ pot side , Ad@@ block Plus released their filter to block their filter in the program to block@@ ed advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change enc@@ oding the coding concerning his advertis@@ ements to det@@ ect it display tracks , which is part of the page advertising is to be created .
but Ad@@ epad announced that it has found a new way to move the new codes .
in a b@@ log@@ an , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in and @-@ Her battle between the open @-@ reaching open source community and the wal@@ nuts are already possible since the in@@ vention of display lock@@ ers in the G@@ ange , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has settled in the fight for social media in the fight , is a strong Indi@@ c@@ ator that has become an emp@@ tive indication for the industry .
according to a survey conducted by Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people in the world , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1,@@ 03 billion , active users who access Facebook to Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung was 84 percent of advertising revenue from Fac@@ e@@ books .
the company has been viewed on the desktop computers , as mobile display block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ e@@ books mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , divided a speaker .
advertising on desktop computers makes a sufficient proportion of income , making Facebook the investment of such st@@ epper than wor@@ th@@ while .
on Tuesday Facebook with that it would update its &quot; Anzei@@ gen@@ pre@@ ational tool &quot; to update the people more control over them to have targeted advertis@@ ements .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that the blo@@ c of new filters would be re@@ gre@@ t@@ ally , because they would also block content on the side that no advertising are .
&quot; for the users the no positive experience , therefore we plan to arrange the problem , &quot; shared a spokes@@ person on Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication .
ad blocks are a silent means that we focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences here , to lay control over the hands of the people .

was a coll@@ ision ?
this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran on the way - was decided that the drivers had not need to go out of them that a pe@@ de@@ strian prec@@ inc@@ t in the night on the highway runs as it was named in the newspaper .

NASA climate model : Venus was inhabited once
the Venus was probably resi@@ due according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably resi@@ due .
scientists at the God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past the Venus and Alg@@ orith@@ ms that res@@ em@@ bles the United States &apos;s climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere had been proved to be proven in the conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggest@@ s that Venus could have a thin , er@@ d@@ ful atmosphere , and still slowly turned back .
the model lit also the to@@ po@@ graphy of the early Venus .
the planet is pres@@ um@@ ably more dry areas than the earth , but had enough water and geo@@ graphic vari@@ ability to har@@ bor life and rapidly ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus and Venus in the sun was almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS entist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , that creates a thick layer of clouds which looks like a umbrella out to remove the surface of a large majority of solar warm@@ th .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than the earth today .
the model brought a story of Venus , which res@@ em@@ bles the evolution of evolution , which was susp@@ ected of plan@@ etary research .
although it was pres@@ um@@ ably resi@@ due , Venus -- was exposed to a lot of heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light over several billion years .
their oc@@ eans and its water vap@@ or was burnt down from the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
when the Hydro@@ gen dis@@ continued only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .

Patrick Roy re@@ signs as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado of Aval@@ an@@ che as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led a too low @-@ determination in decision of the teams .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ Works Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and perc@@ eived that the club is un@@ willing to seek after a new Trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have taken my duties as a leader and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with Energy , passion , and fin@@ eness , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy doing so on a statement .
I &apos;ve spent a long time during the summer time and much about it , as I could improve this team to give him more depth to give it a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the training and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations perfectly adapted to the organization .
it must also have to have a specific legislation on decisions that affect the performance of the team .
currently , these conditions are not met .
Sak@@ ic , Roy was announced on May 23 , 2013 for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreci@@ ate all what he has done for our organisation and wish it for the future only the best .
Roy was awarded during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 winner as the winner of Jack Adams , as the best coach of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed in every one of the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference around five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups got two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nord@@ es@@ ee@@ ö@@ lar@@ ch take talks on , putting strike again
the labour @-@ strug@@ gles concerning the de@@ viation for North Sea , will be subject to the table , whereas all the parties have set his table deb@@ ates on the table , said the negoti@@ ator &apos;s negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil field services Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and the armed forces can confirm that we have re@@ warded us to begin the process process of current disp@@ ute , &quot; is called to a joint statement .
we will keep some full day sessions within the next weeks that will begin the beginning of next year to t@@ ack@@ le the problems .
the trade unions said that her last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage gains of up to 30 percent .
wood Group , this year the rates are short@@ ened to its contrast in the North Sea by around 9 percent , due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rat @-@ reduction in the company is followed by a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations of the companies required to come to reach by the market up@@ swing .
Shell has released for its part thousands of people and plans to announce his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as the result of its business activities as a result of his meg@@ az@@ us@@ ion@@ ist with the British energy companies BG Group .
energy companies are located due to the lower gross oil prices under pressure , a economic situation which had decided by the decision of the British in June to for@@ wards the European Union .
the Scott@@ ish parliament member Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with emplo@@ yers to discuss one of the greatest employment as a generation in North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the local economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few days , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ation Rate of Stars in the star of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ trau@@ m@@ teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers helped to collect the complete catalogue on rotation rates under the stars of the con@@ stellation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
the new data are to understand the astronom@@ ers , why are stars in star@@ fish , as well as in which the Rot@@ ation periods are standing with plan@@ etary process .
&quot; we hope we hope by the Compare of our results with other star , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a resear@@ cher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ aden is 445 light@@ years from the Earth .
a lot of stars in this con@@ stellation were created around 125 million years ago , now the adult age is now .
they turn now at the fastest .
to top of peak rates , these stri@@ pped stars large amounts to star@@ ches .
since this winds are travelling by the magnetic fields of the stars , they have an effective effect on the stars .
if a star is getting old , its rotation rate starts at slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by giving the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ z@@ able star fle@@ cks -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates shows that massive stars s@@ lower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , though larger stars are s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ bles than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors could add mas@@ sively to be massive , while against faster rot@@ ors will add a very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the con@@ stellation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ m@@ ish laboratory to get rid of qu@@ alities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ aden , offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it &apos;s still much before we would like to learn more about how like , W@@ ann and Why stars will slow their rotor speed and appe@@ aring their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the Rot@@ ation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will be published soon in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a contro@@ versi@@ al bas@@ eb@@ all star jo@@ ins from

after his emot@@ ional return transfer , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will bear the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays one last time the tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to both , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ fold All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
he was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 , he won the World Series with Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
his description under a tenth contract was given an agreement of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contrast on December 31 , 2017 , he served as a consultant and youth coach - in full content .
as a player paid to Rodri@@ guez a long time with power .
with 696 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to play some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e Ma@@ ys show two other bas@@ eb@@ all players in the most important statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old does not have to be absor@@ bed the 41 @-@ year @-@ old .
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - Nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so contro@@ versi@@ al is outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the Super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; had been b@@ anned to ster@@ o@@ ids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed due to the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is to be considered the main susp@@ ects , for years , over an Anti @-@ A@@ ging hospital in South @-@ Florida .
after a legal disp@@ ute , the sper@@ m was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the le@@ ague could even have done for this year in 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , said Rodri@@ guez told me at that time .
also his dep@@ ortation days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ leg@@ ations in their last games once again get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job includes no dep@@ ortation tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; Kitt@@ ens Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az married and the t@@ ress of Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson was said to be symp@@ ath@@ y of the fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ val@@ en Boston red SO@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa , and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ op@@ ing cases
re@@ hear@@ ken : due to a positive d@@ op@@ ing sample , weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland can not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ aded by the first official Dop@@ ing event .
a prestigious athl@@ ete has won almost a medal .
in front of the seventh competition , the first official d@@ op@@ ing accid@@ ents have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese sw@@ immer in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metres ste@@ ep@@ le ch@@ ill in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish t@@ lif@@ ter , Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positive and excluded - immediately before the start of the ohn@@ eh@@ in critic@@ ized Athletics @-@ compet@@ itions this news to infin@@ ity .
last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ az@@ ide was already proven on the past Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic agent for d@@ op@@ ing subst@@ ances .
on Friday afternoon , the International athlet@@ ic shof CAS aff@@ ir@@ med their excl@@ usion from the Olympic Games in Friday .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old was occupied by the fourth place in the finals over 100 m of butter@@ fly , only 0,@@ 09 seconds she missed the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the curtain over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has filed an opening of the B @-@ sample at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
the national association &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with investig@@ ations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua of a communication : &quot; we will work with the International Sport Tribunal for CAS and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history is not the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample near Dan@@ ek@@ owa , with the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an un@@ belie@@ vable shock , &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
she is not guilty , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; explained the female .
according to the report , it should act during the b@@ anned substances of the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ent EP@@ O Act .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was preliminary suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample also should have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w applied immediately with critic@@ ism of the athl@@ ete in word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not have the right Schl@@ iss@@ es , &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all the weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter from chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ ent nation can not participate in Rio 2016 .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known in the class up to 85 kg , as soon as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was positive on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both packs the intake , both may not be able to launch in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athl@@ ete , the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa gets a further heav@@ ier impact for the rep@@ utation of the entire sports .
the world association IAAF world &apos;s complete Russian crew up to an exception for system@@ atic d@@ op@@ ing the start was also produced in Rio numerous bad news .
at the sw@@ im sport in addition , the former verses in China was also su@@ cked to athletes between athletes and athletes .
thus , the Fr@@ ench@@ man Camille Lac@@ o@@ urt made the Chinese Olympi@@ as@@ ie@@ ger Sun Yang .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; if I see the podium over 200 m as@@ l , I will deliver me , &quot; said Lac@@ o@@ urt in the French radio .
Sun stood at the centre of a med@@ itation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I don &apos;t have time and respect for d@@ op@@ ing @-@ dec@@ eiver , &quot; this .
Sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese championships positive to the stim@@ ul@@ ans tri@@ met@@ az@@ id@@ in , but only a three @-@ month lock had to sit down .
datab@@ ases : so per@@ fi@@ de re@@ presses H@@ acker their soldering tip
programmer by pressing malware belts are currently targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware un@@ tary Speci@@ alists , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were at least once , 40 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months , some victims of an attack with t@@ ack@@ ers software .
in Germany alone , nearly 20 percent of companies had already been a target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware product .
40 percent of the victims pay@@ ed delivered by the per@@ pet@@ ition required to use the challeng@@ ed systems and data .
the per@@ pet@@ rators speci@@ alize their ex@@ press@@ ors software according to the ob@@ serv@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , on an attack on attacks in company network .
they are successful there , the potential to er@@ pres@@ erve extinc@@ tion significantly higher than in privacy .
&quot; we are currently running a sc@@ ary fast evolution of the poll@@ uting software , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ Chef Marc@@ in Kle@@ cz@@ ynski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most folk programs were designed to support advertising .
then the per@@ pet@@ ed ex@@ press@@ ant software was discovered .
only private users were the target , but the change of the company was s@@ reck@@ oned quickly in the past months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once upon the computer of a breath , looking for in@@ comprehen@@ sively changed files such as Word@@ Press , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives images and videos .
these files are encrypted using the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes origin@@ als .
then the software will be presenting the recei@@ v@@ ables of the press@@ ors .
in order to get the final key code to the files , victims must have the victims of money - usually in the form of the cr@@ ypto@@ graphy - Bit@@ coin .
but where privacy uses the personal photo database on the game , it goes with companies to sensitive clients or project datab@@ ases , without shut down the production .
accordingly , the damage exceeds the damage when R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware sank .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent even the business activities had to break completely in a case of human being .
in Germany , several hosp@@ itals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of health prec@@ eding .
&quot; we don &apos;t say to the victims , &quot; p@@ ays you only the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; Kle@@ cz@@ ynski . &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay , get their data again .
for managers , it &apos;s difficult to re@@ ject the processing of per@@ pet@@ rators in the operation .
the h@@ acker again know , and try to build a good rep@@ utation .
in a recent study , the security for@@ scher of F @-@ Secure accounts for use areas and contact with the ex@@ press@@ ors , and come to the result : the per@@ pet@@ rators are actually trying to provide a type of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims per chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free access sites on or de@@ cryp@@ t otherwise example files .
and they will be dis@@ sol@@ ving their privacy according to payments of a few hundred euro , companies must pay hard @-@ negoti@@ ate and fif@@ teen tot@@ als to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potenti@@ ally high and relatively ris@@ ol@@ ol@@ ites win@@ nings from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware @-@ ex@@ press@@ ant , the h@@ acker is always professional and share the work , explains safety @-@ sex@@ y Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware of roughly within one week . &quot;
however , it is likely that there are three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell your damage software in the form of a software building to the actual Er@@ press@@ ors .
the previous malware kits were created by malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool , so small configur@@ ations , appearance and fire can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the press@@ ors are then looking for further h@@ acker that bought the fresh@@ ly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one log@@ gers in one of the for@@ ums in the fore@@ ground , the set of a crime and instruc@@ ts another order to install the software as a lot of PCs .
payment is made per inf@@ eri@@ zed calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the cri@@ min@@ als bear sp@@ ammer with sp@@ reading , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
by many companies , the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known to secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies @-@ IT respon@@ si@@ bilities included in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey to trust R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ ers@@ software .
accordingly , the per@@ pet@@ rators are already new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient for successful expl@@ oration , the per@@ pet@@ rators are based instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or price kal@@ ns , &quot; by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of Marc@@ in Kle@@ cz@@ ynski .
this makes the damage potential for the type of data even more than before .
the per@@ pet@@ rators could also be completely new targets on the internet of things on the Internet .
at the h@@ oriz@@ on Conference Def@@ ects demonstrated security forces , such as they were able to receive the thermo@@ most@@ at under their control .
in the middle of winter , the acqu@@ is@@ itions of a der@@ art block@@ ed heating so man@@ chem vic@@ tim to be a ran@@ s@@ om value .
if the per@@ pet@@ rators then instead of heating in future a whole production line in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be a topic in the industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and daily dust .
in the small HR @-@ V Honda has packed everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the vers@@ at@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty much over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz , proved to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the 1,60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers flying both in the first series as well as in the f@@ ond position , it works closely together .
the interior materials of the interior is well processed and operate pleas@@ antly , only the cock@@ pit @-@ upper part falls on a little bit .

it is not only a boot of 453 l with high @-@ produced and 10@@ 26 l with the folding back@@ rests , but there is the Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically , as it sounds : the seat of the back@@ bank can rise and offer the storage space that is up to 2.35 m from the floor up to the ce@@ il@@ ings .
the luggage compartment can be loaded , however , the charging height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than similar to the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in a wide increase .
however , he is likely to make a quiet place however .

two USB@@ - and a HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 2@@ 9000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest much in much , the gasoline can earn starting from 20000 euros , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .

improved traffic flow on the highway
there is a regular update on the out@@ going road - here is a picture of November .
but this is supposed to change : the legal process is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car driver that stand in the trade fair in the surrounding area every evening , when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road@@ business road pro@@ long@@ ed in the area between the hammer and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer and the descent Wes@@ eler street to the legal right track by 700 meters .
car driver can then go directly from the hammer to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early , reducing the overall set exp@@ ir@@ ation on the most versatile section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the District of Münster and West .
the driving lane on the fe@@ eder is nerv@@ ous nerv@@ es mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the back@@ drop down to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also in addition .
reason is the pin@@ ions run on the B 51 , shortly before the Wes@@ eler street .
from here the traffic only becomes a track bridge over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be back in some three @-@ four@@ ths of years .
the reason : static comp@@ resses show that the bridge has no longer the required load force to record mainly the heavy duty cycle .
as long as these bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated inter@@ iors will not say the permanent business operation may not say .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping dis@@ orders
in the evening , one gets around for ever , at night it is st@@ unden@@ long , in the morning , already far from the wake @-@ up balls are no longer thinking about sleep .
that &apos;s all others as relaxing .
after all , you can find such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep problems and more than ten percent take their sleep frequently or permanent than not working .
how external problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep dist@@ urban@@ ces , and there can be varied causes of several causes , st@@ ressed Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , board member of the German Society for phar@@ yn@@ olds and sleep medicine .
so what is land@@ ed among them , however , is the in@@ som@@ ni@@ ons , thus a power supply and a break@@ down .
just that , many people are regarded as un@@ satis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German Ho@@ ist Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what ′ s behind sleep dis@@ orders ?
the causes of sleep dis@@ orders are complex .
in behind , organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ oral factors , but also stu@@ ck together .
not rare is the sleep inter@@ ference of another condition .
&quot; very early today , especially at a de@@ pression often , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it may be that various factors are thre@@ aten .
those who has a c@@ erv@@ ical her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad@@ ly , aw@@ akes every two to three hours and begins to sal@@ ute over all @-@ day problems and ensure a example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should I sleep with sleep problems ?
who does not sleep over a period of one month in at least three nights a week , should not sleep well on the day , should go to the doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look different from different : it is be@@ aten , f@@ ain@@ ted , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ ated , has ab@@ stain@@ ed or physical compl@@ aints such as stomach or he@@ ada@@ ches .
to lin@@ king the sleeping mind , it is important to find their causes .
as a therapeutic options come from among other behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medic@@ ations - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases , and at the most for two weeks - demand .
in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ xed , head of the inter@@ discipl@@ inary medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that one should have to sleep in sleep problems on the ho@@ di@@ atri@@ cian , while we@@ e@@ wer .
it can clar@@ ify with investig@@ ations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should sleep into a sleep laboratory , and what happened ?
for exam@@ inations in the sleep laboratory , medical pres@@ cri@@ bed for example with re@@ spir@@ atory symptoms , in illness and if you do not find the cause of a break@@ through sleep , explained fi@@ brill@@ ation .
you must not prepare for the investigation .
it should be normal to day .
&quot; only please make no lunch sli@@ ps , &quot; says spru@@ ce .
following the short@@ ens , one goes into the bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electro@@ des on the body you can stick a rhin@@ estones , chest strap and a anten@@ n@@ ae on the finger .
there is also a camera to the ceiling to the ceiling .
how can I enco@@ unter@@ ed the problems in the handle ?
there are fair@@ ly many mount screws , where one can sleep for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß is on : regular sleep and wed@@ dings , not to long in bed , not to sleep , not to sleep , not to sleep , alcohol most , and at night does not start at the clock - then we begin to reck@@ on , and that &apos;s all , and all is not convey@@ ed .
what the Jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming
today , the former German sw@@ immer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has appointed the dis@@ appo@@ inting lines of the D@@ SV teams at Olympic Games .
in December 2014 , he brought the first world record for the first time in Doha , and presented his first world record at the same time .
now , the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler have put on Facebook se@@ ag@@ ates in the cr@@ iti@@ que of the former ex @-@ team mate .
&quot; in a country , where a truck gets € 20,000 p@@ a@@ emia and a j@@ uris@@ mo@@ o 150,000 € should not be missing on lack of missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ olds on the night on its Facebook page .
the convey@@ ing system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ op@@ ing control is very good .
so that we cannot compete with countries , which are very much promote and on d@@ op@@ ing d@@ op@@ ing .
&quot; I don &apos;t tell that the controls are to be set , &quot; explained . &quot;
to start a com@@ eb@@ ack , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported in nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .

airport : Ban@@ de of Lug@@ gage el arrested
professional Th@@ ie@@ ves at the Airport Düsseldorf
the civ@@ il@@ ization of the Dus@@ seldorf &apos;s police succeeded in Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed as a ban@@ quet of several T@@ ash@@ en- and glo@@ om@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock the civil servants in Düsseldorf at the Düsseldorf Airport , a ban@@ quet that was known to the police officers from last the@@ ft .
the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ik@@ es in mid @-@ July and were shared , working , and especially professional .
the specialists at the Kri@@ min@@ al@@ Comm@@ iss@@ ariat 34 can have the th@@ ief , who has travel@@ ed to Germany from criminal off@@ ences after Germany , four de@@ eds .
they had carried a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
Alt@@ ona , a few lin@@ qu@@ ets , there are still a rest of head@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not appear on the first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the town .
walk from the east to the West , one walks in the play@@ grounds , a refresh@@ ing nurs@@ ery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone is ug@@ ly at the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a grey house ! &quot;
opposite to a L@@ id@@ l , who will soon be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 , there is a house with high windows and 133 new home apartments .
article about this &quot; tr@@ endy district , &quot; as the permanent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , are illustrated in the last weeks but is illustrated with burning cars .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents are occupied by the ground floor , however , rooms are still occupied spaces and are util@@ ised for events .
since the beginning of the Berlin interior , on the beginning of the year , an hard demonstration of the police have been pr@@ ono@@ unced against the project , the area known as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of aut@@ onomous violence .
after 22 June , on 22 June the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were ev@@ acu@@ ated , with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers was commissioned by the un@@ familiar building owners of the premises .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearing had been illegal , and a day later , police and buil@@ ders under the Je@@ bel of Sym@@ path@@ is@@ ants and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents are going to walk with children , people sit on the offices in front of the houses in the sun , others stop sp@@ ati@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gardens .
left violence is not the main oral of many calls : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has been living here for three children , mostly from the police officer .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they wor@@ shipped the wor@@ ry before increasing and Gent@@ iles .
it sounds not just after a pine , who wants to have a holi@@ stic pol@@ lin@@ ers prior to the left @-@ left .
the Gr@@ aben , the Berlin Philharmonic , and the police between troops and their neigh@@ bo@@ urs , is evi@@ d@@ ently not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Berlin actually was a traditional emplo@@ yer , which is also in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average and high poverty risk .
there are also numerous houses and the property of living projects are already long to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR , among them almost the whole main@@ land road near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cle@@ ared under large police officers , many of the projects had leg@@ alised in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still occupied by people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district is increasingly becoming increasingly for tourists and Ele@@ ction liner from around the world : with them , An@@ n@@ atives from GDR times and former HA@@ USB@@ ES@@ ET@@ ZER are their Kie@@ z .
this can also be found in the Mi@@ eten , which has increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ builds in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they det@@ ect it on the broken disc or fresh@@ ly kn@@ itted Fac@@ ades which were sub@@ jected to color @-@ wr@@ aps .
no other street this year was so often associated with the word &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ onomous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
a reason for that , not all the neigh@@ bo@@ urs cannot see the problem that they are not necess@@ arily be affected by cri@@ min@@ ality : offen@@ ders such as body inju@@ ries , according to statistics according to polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make the damage to the new@@ building , ten@@ ds to meet the new@@ builds and fresh@@ ly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house for 17 years along with the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 years , un@@ certain@@ ty of un@@ certain@@ ty .
what violent acts , it is qui@@ eter : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bo@@ urs , which should not be determined .
also the famous burning cars give it directly to the Rig@@ a@@ er already longer .
for the studied architect , its road is not a criminal burning fuel , on the contrary : &quot; it helps one another who lives together on the street and gets more apart , than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deli@@ ber@@ ately moved to the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
therefore it was so important that the inhabitants are looking back to their road : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all claim the interpretation through the neighborhood .
however , in the eyes of inhabitants as new building , the road will continue to be taken away : by dis@@ arm@@ ing new@@ building in the former building , which land@@ marks the old residents .
&quot; these are finally finally cond@@ om@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so far g@@ orge , &quot; says it .
&quot; Viol@@ ence and Dest@@ ru@@ ction can I not thei@@ rs . &quot;
but what should I do when someone list@@ ens to someone ?
there is on all pages Fru@@ its , also in the police and the residents .
for a tra@@ iled painting , Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the j@@ ams and the left scene was belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who moves , should be aware of his - just as someone who gets in a l@@ ei@@ ving area there is bad about noise .
all only names must be presented with the names of the people , not to be called with their real name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le is a new refugee agent
An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le is the Cont@@ act@@ ancy in terms of integration and organiz@@ ers .
in addition , she is working as a social worker .
since July An@@ nika De@@ ur@@ le is the refugee agent for Ur@@ bach .
social education supports the team of managing Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it looks as a support for all players : refugees , Working Group for refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who knew else else .
Reg@@ ine customer base suggest@@ s that the volunte@@ er has more than th@@ ank@@ ful , that De@@ usch@@ le is now there is a dil@@ ig@@ able wool of Woll@@ um@@ au , which has a problem .
for instance , some - less sp@@ lic@@ ited than rather to explore the multitude of desired zones that wanted to write the position as the administration .
we wanted to find an administration force with a tal@@ ent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
however , administrative work is not its central area , we@@ ep An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le .
especially the organization , work with people in front of the place and behind the scenes and net@@ working activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
she has a 50 @-@ percent stop to three years .
&quot; it was highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le Ehr@@ en- and General Public Ac@@ tors supports .
there are large and small issues , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
new container in the Was@@ Route
there has been a serious problem to find it since some time , apartments for the wiring fle@@ ets , which have been recognized .
the municip@@ alities are responsible for the connection .
you have to accommodate refugees in own or registered living rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of this accommodation must have the commun@@ es itself .
the respon@@ si@@ bilities changes from the land , comm@@ une and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but everyone wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de fac@@ to finds no private apartments .
so far , it was not functional , yet to be instruc@@ ted on private apartments , so De@@ usch@@ le .
therefore , we need to be ch@@ ased out of the city , as it is so beautiful .
so soon you will find new container in the Was@@ Route .
but only with fl@@ ats it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le .
in addition to a solid lead , training places , training places , training courts , one @-@ euro jobs and exp@@ ecting activities for refugees and mig@@ rants who are gre@@ ased or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports .
many work in the building yard or help master &apos;s useful work - and motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , as An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le reported .
it h@@ opes that the work leads to an positive external effect .
that be &quot; no employment therapy &quot; .
worked , but doesn &apos;t think work .
the day a fixed structure , say De@@ usch@@ le and Customer .
people should have to develop a breeding feel .
so there will be special offers like sports , contacts with loc@@ als and especially voice courses .
professional classes are r@@ ar .
so I also ski@@ p here to administration and volunteers .
it is central , that the refugees could get the feeling in Germany , and welcome them .
the long time of procedure is a problem .
you have to explain the refugees that it takes some time and they might need the time of sen@@ sible bar@@ ri@@ ders , for example with language courses .
whoever developed some of the feeling that could help you in Ur@@ bach , could not work , and be un@@ profit@@ able , who will never integ@@ rate .
the distinct majority are motiv@@ ated .
however , the problem exists , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of De@@ usch@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ate to motiv@@ ate others .
all this was a &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : have the two after recent prec@@ eding fear of radi@@ als , also in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , &quot; what lack of n@@ ai@@ v may call . &quot; a resi@@ due , and wool they don &apos;t excl@@ ude . &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ let are the hel@@ per .
these incid@@ ents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear of that the assass@@ ination will bring them completely in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; you want to show nothing to do nothing , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main and volunte@@ er in front of the place and in the region after a show .
they always have always in the background that soon a new store could come to refugees and mig@@ rants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer the policy .
actually it is un@@ fair to put them away from the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived there where we want to go , &quot; says An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le .
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes also clear that the Ur@@ bacher also inten@@ ds to integ@@ rate the previous people to integ@@ rate the previous people .
that is currently around 100 people , the greater part of young men .
however , if people are in need , you have to help them , both women are one .
the political globe situation is so comp@@ lic@@ ated , there are no simple answers .
