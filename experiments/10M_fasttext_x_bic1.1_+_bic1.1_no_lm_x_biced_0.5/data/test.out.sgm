<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and invest the trade agreement TTP - that would like to provide both Clinton as well as trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential statements are however, however, in terms of tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basically important philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns before the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton to reduce death and regulate economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, it would be quite different, claimed trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will return controllers in solid, and he makes for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantageous opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the tax would increase if the rich man would say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the muts we will say Trump and Clinton almost worries.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classical and democratic policies and are rejected by the nationwide Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So that dump might still be taken into internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in the energy and climate policy are clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and return coal transport in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil sponsorship will also be possible to be able to cancel the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand the renewable energies with their investment program and calls: "a country will create the superpower of the clean energy and million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it, that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements are the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transplantation trade agreements, would not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both but not want to isolate the U.S. from international trade, but simply just protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">These are also better to be paid by Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hungry.</seg>
<seg id="27">It will increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go down, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the large discussion of the next month is likely to develop the taxation of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump, who wants to load the economy and citizens to spur growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep before, the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other side Clinton indicates that at least from the rich men want to pay more taxes, and their critics say, more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every woman has gained experience with sexual violence."</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost already to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has a little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious with great eyes in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stowed on the top plate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they noted that it is watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled, and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene affects normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is an area manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid workers in Bavaria, and deals with the theme of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">Four women in the kitchen are fully-fledged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North, in one of the few decentralized hotels for allergy-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are no longer than visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who comes here, has made his escape experience with sexual violence," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because they are politically persecuted because they threaten death or death, because they send them as a hopes to send them as a hopes to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">Women weigh several reasons for the escape: "many steal themselves secretly, because they don't see any other way."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home they have experienced experience with sexual violence, twins, honorary morden, slavery, or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">It drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for a bottle of water is demand for a bottle of water, is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who think that the end once they were anked in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here are all women in refugees were often considered a minderous and worse and worse case.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich Region, are traumatised, estimates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so usual that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or she does not trust, open to talk about it, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they were often not ready to help, need more accommodations for them, requesting Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven District rains are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they were using a similar project as in Munich in its courage range, answer some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the pfalz and Oberfranken there are about something in foremost governments of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben alone, women are not separated by women, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, under- and Central franken there are rooms in some common floors or own houses only for sole women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The "rights of women and gender equality" also calls for women to be housed by men in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the Committee, it is: "it's very important that men and women can be accommodated separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"is missing privacy or men and women together, it may come to - persistent - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower room should be separate and suitable for women easily, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">As much the women of this protection, you can read at the Andrang in Munich, which there is home to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since itself has been speaking, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of exteriors"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a barest which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met in Tuesday to announce the hands and an official end of the eight months in the war of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin met his Turkish backups in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I can't forget that Ankara reconciliation that Ankara reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was the handle, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But putting the smile in the smile, and radiated almost warmth, even for his return conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan said to be repeated von his "love friend" Putin - according to a report of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that the relationship with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis but could even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan would have risen so that it would never be a bit of limentary.</seg>
<seg id="11">Me seemed to be a little enthusiasm rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's impecoming, sustainable cooling showed that the government of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first that he mentioned in his entry, the shooting of a Russian campaign aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Moscow, Moscow was scanned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided from and accused Ankara to have fallen back into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Verger was even bigger, since it was committed by a mean boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetroid rebuild it difficult when it's not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the nationally controlled media conducted a very restricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed to it, when the Turks would carry all the debt for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the serious, the accusations of conductive civil servants were benefited to benefit from illegal oil retail in areas of Syrians who want to be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He took this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only in place because Putin received from the President of the Erdogan, who wanted to hear it.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice club is clear on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first line all friends who can get in the last month after the last month at a failed coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economical motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have met Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually reach several million Russian tourists from the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of numbers decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will simplify if the flights be taken again.</seg>
<seg id="33">They will count towards a late seasonal day of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the national TV cheap fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this way: "tourists there long, tomatoes are long here."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara has risen in the west, since it was reaction to the attempting making a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this, the benefit of the accession to the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to draw out of cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian state of government won a bonus that he asked for the chosen state-rich support for the chosen state organe.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's worth a self-condition, that itself has a self-sitting anxiety before regiming.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this smooth palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one as it described an analyst once described, "Alliance of exterior decorates" to introduce two countries that are cast away from the West and bad.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, between the two still a wide difference.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently announced the role as a Nobel Prize, but to support Russia and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noted that after almost three hours of the initial presidents on the press conference, they told that they had not stacks the topic once again.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey missed it deliberately to answer over their differences, while Putin decided to worship this.</seg>
<seg id="46">It's no clear consensus where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months, fine hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when the NATO member of Turkey cancels the Russian fighter jet - certainly better to talk the two heads of state at least again.</seg>

<seg id="11">I think that it is the most important task of government to support your activities as state-of-office and controls to support your instructions.</seg>

<seg id="13">Convince the smile?</seg>

<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the most severe confession Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet Intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chief of Staff was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted in television, the men of staff moved to his own request at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, here only few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the episode of a kind of battle?</seg>
<seg id="20">The white currently no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was glorified as a potentially President on once the Russian environmental policy is based on large sceptisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who are cited on the site of the Kreml, Ivanov said it is true that I had asked this very complicated post - one could almost say - complain a weight for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it is out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidency for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov participated in the Posts in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Earlier, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessicherish Intelligence (FSB), the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin called his power, he called Ivanov called one of five people who trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could have been President of Putin on the second term of Putin as a third term of putting Putin against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became President of three-half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating, how the world is changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child to play no longer to go outside, but rather you prefer to spend their leisure time to rigid, in the last decade of repent.</seg>
<seg id="4">For Pokemon Go you go to pick people from the sofa and will be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was initially set on the TV, then video playback and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities in the open.</seg>
<seg id="7">I go to of course of course on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a App, which were created in the 1990s, which were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later released a drawing series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries has been moved through massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go more users as a Tinder, and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go left with their smart phones and search for Pokémons, which are persecuted with a GPS persecuted, once they have found once again, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game, when she was still younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a sizable increase in steps taken by the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35,000 users, divided the Washington Post, distributed within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed, who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company knows not, who plays the Pokémon Go - it looks like the raw data to increase output.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public reconntampage to health, people want to participate in "30 minutes" from the sofa "and" every day to be actively seized ears, because many public messages are coming in the health boring and of people come back.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports can't be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who drives regularly sport, reduces his chances to explore cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages which is too long to run them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open car that you have fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of the health are covered - motion, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close on the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">Like always there are mürric game derderber, who always have to complain about a little weight.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone might run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if you have a smartphone apps like Fitbit already before our activity, they gave no reason to play sport, as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New will lose its maturity, and use the use with the time.</seg>

<seg id="2">This is what I prescribed to me under the women's olysfunction in the tower and that out of more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been doing so dominant since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA were never dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this crew has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls who inspired other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew ist and Madison Kocher, the Catholickin is abrished, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">The USA reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the past four years, the number one was one of the female turbocharists.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising OlympiagFestival and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the believable performance of three-fold world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but most effective Gymastic routines manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone the fourth, heterosexuals US, was awarded for women in an individual combined events for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but like to see Turnover in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics is only four turbines in the team. in addition, this year is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns is an expensive sports and Turner first line in private gyms that will be exciting for training, business, travel, travel, travel, and hotel costs (for the Trainer and their Turner and families). the list can be able to continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms are located in wealthy suburbs, which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner will get your total training and this is a long-term commitment for families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainers by Laurie Hernandez, have both their athletes who have started with the tower since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to inspire the congregations of Aun unnumbered, young girls who wants to inspire by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easier access training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnout by 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we have free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15.000 visitors (mainly black and hispanic), and national and international winner.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is an dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make him a little safer.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to relocate with armed incense.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether you come from front or from the rear you will show you this video as you turn to your incense.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you attach to you from behind the back then you should turn to your attackers, so that you can see your attackers and "says from the Line of Fire," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon then between your forearm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbows.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him then with the knees in the bar and turn, while the attackers forward pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run and move back, while they make up the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="8">For Angers that approaches from the front, is the technology similar - move your body from the Line of Fire, seize the weapon and rotate it, so that the attackers cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">If you prefer the weight at the weapon and beat the attackers on the chest, then turn the weapon from his handle before they move back and make the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British travel underwent the immune system and dignity of a serious review by taking some of the dirtiest and ekadful locations of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Moderator and itautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk aborted its relocation on a euro banknotes, a schembracing on the Piccadilly Circus, a rinse button in the toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before departure, he used a luminaire to show and show us what he will leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to recover the rinsing button of a tractor, which has already been used by thousands of others, but it is really impervious to shock in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright joined the physicians and medical experts about the funding of Darmbakteries, as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily he didn't leave anything that he was refucked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of its gut, by giving birth by the world and very strange things.</seg>
<seg id="10">Public money change on train stations up to jetting of toilets, the task set its immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child was relatively unconcerned, what my health: and I have tasted all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and slammation."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was just a fall to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejection, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proposition showed a luminometric number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometric number of freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to reimitate after their luminosity exceeds 4000 units, whereas in freshly washed hands one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and Finnish manufacturers of dairy valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of several sites like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "this is the worst thing that I kept in a toilet, close to."</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not afraid here because it is perfect here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturers of dairy products.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company used Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both Lactobacilli and D, to support the funding of Darmbakteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating, and the benefits of Probiotics are declared at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried forward Brainstormings by which we endure that we said "Lass to call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest is intestinal health to a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead just about the products, we wanted to make them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily surroundings, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is linked with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense for humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala who led the film director - I would like to say, "I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had some of the things which I have told him, like the elderly Russian toilet, which will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, it was easier to bring to what it was easier to try them and others, in which it was quite hard.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty leakies. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of the survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents of Lactobacilli and 58 percent said that they can use at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">The surprising Cecilia Bartoli offers an unsurprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">One musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic, and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra, Simón Bolívar Orchestra conducted by the Venezuelan Diocgenten Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," fluctuated.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that she is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in its Tempo, and her melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older of that Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She reminds with Wehmut to her lovers with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dance.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because they are unusually extraordinarily!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Marias personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I Feel Pretty, oh so Pretty, I Feel Pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is so clever, of course also naiv, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is similar to me, my Italian character, whom I have as Römerin," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of loying for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It's such a honour to work with you.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is a monster generous man.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli gives the compliment back: "Dudamel is an extraordinary artists and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conductor is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You can see it in every one of his movements, in his blisters, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It's such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a cheerful approach to life, that's very important!</seg>
<seg id="27">Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly currently: "this piece is about preurers and fanatism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we went to New York at that time, the Puertoricans had gone back to New York, and they didn't want to know the New York residents.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the ones get nothing from the summer elections with - and the holiday from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood them in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the landing beam will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the European Parliament approved the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because Blöder as so far, it does not have: summer holidays, heat and landscape fighting - which kisses itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are convinced by the sufficiency, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of most tourists that are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are no deposit, must not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">These include practical issues: in the holidays are helpers to distribute the posters, aeropons inflatable, flyers, and to count towards the end of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4th, 2016, the election and the last days of days, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has to be gone over on the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase if you can say it, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it also goes to something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, the leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, which has been the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, how powerful Neuling Afr remains and what remains of the end of coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes a very unobtrusive campaign, you can see from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across land, spread roses and platters a little with the people, as it is already his legendary debut of Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, sailering has got cold feet and is pulpit in Merkel the guilt in the blossom of the Afr.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your refugee policy, their "We want to make up the ascent of the spoooists, what is presumably that it is probably the good office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its flagship data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced even as it is when you have a wrong time on the right place elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Angela Merkel has been invited to major explorations in the northeast of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group was not voted, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it does not include any other corners of Germany, even Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the northeast CDU automatically refuses to market conditions on market conditions and shopping malls with sunshades and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, so weep Kokert, plays only one "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noticed that you may die in the country the basis that it must be very challenged to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You just like the left, the SPD, the Green Party: in the country of the country hardly available.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU election campaign in Kokert is also self-larvous: "you need to go to where it is weaken, namely, where people are: Dorffeste, golden weddings, any birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game, the SPD has called his SPD now called to a dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Social Democrats last was last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD had a clear level of 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Green Party, a small party with seven percent in polls, you can create the jump into the country life.</seg>
<seg id="32">They are out of the holidays need a modern Tugend and lie their electoral campaign, mostly to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign," calls the president Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green electoral bucks to track search for local abdicates have been among the vacationers.</seg>

<seg id="8">Although the opposite number is responsible for the construction work, about when there are around the installation of heating stations.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has been emigrated since the construction site at Ofterdingen and again, the connection to Rottenburg has again abolished itself, the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now come from Ofterdingen, from the B 27 again on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The transport through the place seems back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since there were partly significant complaints," says the responsible management of the refurbishment of the refurbishment of Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The occupier of Bacharstraße, Steinlachroad, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many vastes searched, and rather her Navi trusted as the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What happened to do some trucks in housing areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">The speed limit does not have been observed, the assembly has strengthened the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="23">However, some more and some are affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who has produced less to do with the "final clients" which has been produced for other companies, for the renovation of barely any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also in the car house Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks a "most slight decrease in the" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The Local along the road are growing along the road.</seg>

<seg id="28">That's already threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all guest restaurants have been hit "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">It is missing the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be glad about every Euro.</seg>
<seg id="32">The revenue rose by far more than 50 percent. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The street activation has thrown his operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his staff have to dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">When I had a firm of 4,000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have to react differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Regulator President Jörg Schmidt is on a request of Göhner, whether it could answer any financial statements, otherwise the hostility will benefit from the benefits of the location on the B 27. now they had the disadvantages to carry out the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other land circles, which was so much more generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all sounds, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business already has been located here since 1715, referring to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">But other regular passengers now because of the complicated traffic leadership less often, can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you don't drive, it is also beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">According to the end of the sanitation works, Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">In spite of crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner holds the effects of B 27 construction work on its clients for the largest crisis, which has experienced his hostelage in their long history history.</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner to all this?</seg>

<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach has given a little time before he presents its conclusions on safety in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are now able to fall more extensive.</seg>

<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and justified.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some even unbalanced and can open questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - when the inequality of thought for instance - is the question: what does that actually do with certainty and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not able to provide the attacks by Ansbach and Würzburg refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">There were also many people in view of the high refugees Sorgen around the safety.</seg>

<seg id="40">We have called the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">It refresh, be not meaningful.</seg>

<seg id="43">Whether his own package on all corners are constitutional and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, must still show only.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is a lot in mind that could care for war.</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite diesel scandals, the supplier numbers are going to increase.</seg>

<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, the deliveries are increased by almost a hexagons.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trademark manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weakening numbers from July especially to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, it has given a purchasing conditions in some nuclear markets. "</seg>

<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust pipes first, also stands on a minus beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">Large stand for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">In total, mainly on-person domestic product is mainly relayed by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, there is only one supplier of 0.9 percent to 3,37 million vehicles on beech.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales of the Fred Kappler joined the sales representative of January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Up to 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered in this period, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software of gastoidal manipulates.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is approximately 2.5 million carriages to repair the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the conversion, VW is that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">Based on vehicles, it will give fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, or motor performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">The builder set the customer after the conversion a "guaranteed" certificate, but does not say from a "guarantee" as it was called on Friday in the company's office.</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason are legal advises.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported, Volkswagen grant his German customers now and guarantee a guarantee of the diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have been confirmed on the last Monday VW-representatives at the Federal Ministry of Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the traffic authority has been confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has carried out the support of my investigating Commission and its KBA customer's KBA customer."</seg>
<seg id="29">"variations of these are not accepted," explained the Federal Minister of Justice Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, or engine capacity according to the conversion no deteriorations and all typically approved vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen himself uses the term "guarantee" but not how it was in corporate travel.</seg>
<seg id="32">The wide term "guarantee" is the possibility to return an half year after the conversion around with a motor damage to a workshop - and that could lead to the new software, even though the damage caused nothing to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="33">In order to avoid too, it is important to avoid that there is nothing at any other damages not to do with the Abgasskandal, according to an indispensing, such as it was named.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, do not use the term "warranty" not.</seg>

<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV would follow me the camera would follow me in Soho - a modest suit and wild ass, before I stand fast, my hands hold and something like: "so, let us take a look at a look at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at a look.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly at his charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now fill in the building where once independent seller are, there are as a handful of fantastic turntables.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would like to ask the cameraman, the camera for the next part, in which I stand in immediate vicinity of different men in such stores and try to watch their age and mood thanks to observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to the Ray (data count: two young women, three men mean age) into Reckless Records (data quantity: eight men mean age, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I have already looking forward," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, depicted above (he sent me down the snapshot by email, I'm not followed by home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses a solely sizable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: it is now able to buy records as they were not able to purchase orders when he sold, when he was young and pledge.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early 70s, which had appeared as I was 11 or 12. things I have to buy something too young to buy it," says he.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who want to buy boards, rather than verted, and add a lot alone time, and adds: "I smoke, and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who is working at Sister Ray, believes also that many customers that he meets, on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave to people that are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and let's see their old vinyl look again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the discussions that I have led, people usually have been part of their collection in 1998, 1999 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy again their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in a particular aging.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what is the alleged emotional importance?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds to see Phonica in order to recognise that the turnaround is a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WEZ, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of trusted sound insulation, from objects to watch the happiness.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a empty or property material as a kind of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors and I think it is with many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to employ spiritual.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" a staff members of a plate stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record for the last month, they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey found out that 41% have a record players who never use it, while 7% of those who have one record, do not have a record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I have a stack to Bossa Nova Compressed.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at the sounds of the Universe (data count: three men middle age), has noticed a "trophies" of revies. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone first came out here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radikead sound top, so that I may ask them at the shelf, "says he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage but it seems definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musikles.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say, "I don't have a turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which only slowly rejoined.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has an audience audience, when I clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists, the photos do, teens and women's medium-age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is less relaxed as in the above stores - wild beaver's latest synthesizations and sexbepackter pop instead of experimental jazz reconciled from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversität in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks different from them, but brand psychic traumata are difficult to be able if you stand to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, is running in business for a couple of minutes and considered the variation of the sheets available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more mannequin for a mannequin.</seg>
<seg id="50">She deserves not much, therefore the plates of records no real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to a computer or any other way, but the beauty of discs is... "they drives with a desirable sinning.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of record lovers have to be inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the order to realize the jeans Hotpants, I follow a group of young teens, that allows for a moment to buy a Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter to purchase a Crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left a staircase is a staircase of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at - maybe, because they are only clean, some so far above that it is impossible to put them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "Disk Art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in relation that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry, and some customers could leave the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is beyond the luxury houses as panels.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research results showed that the results of YouGov agree they, at least in height, the great number of female collectors and record women who exist in reality, turnaround and in online.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people work perfectly hard at school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumming of platform, Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while the stubble view of an insecret, 30-year-old wrong presenter, who ruled over the shoulders of nothing at the middle age.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou passed by further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, when Fiji was born in addition to play 7, while the UK still has been harvested.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is so too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB resulted in the basic changes to half-time, and completed the fibreastical gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half time, until Joshua Tuisova was running after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touching down in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game ran long to the south insulin insulin, whose fans flocks, flocks schemes and dance on the tribune.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Singen has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girls, she was in the school choir as a teacher-studying music, and today he sings the 78-year-old in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing myself - emotionally and physical," she describes them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a sample they feels out, cheerful and a total of life, says them.</seg>
<seg id="5">Next, she does, in her health, and her spirit something good.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is equal to several perspectives in a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler von der Deutsche Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular social contacts can and maintain social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because frequently, social and familiar structures aged on, a chorus is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel kipp in her choir: "to make sure to get to the others and learn to each other - a part of a special shape of collapse."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sing in the positive sense in the positive sense, weep Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because they train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever calls his lung regularly, that is not on the daily life as fast as the Puste.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it's why to get the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is a optimale hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On elderly people, Singen often did a special effect, Ursula Lenz states of the seniors of the seniors organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, shared with a much higher job, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz observed that the singing or listening of songs in older people many memories are often associated with positive feel of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies are dementiced people in long lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing is also a special performance, Lingen is also declared a special performance.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, on their own voice and to focus on a prey rhythm and adjust the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people, who alone live alone, do not only need to focus on yourself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition he rides through the singing in the choir, weep Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">A enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows by the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Themselves, if I have long for something, I will be better and awake over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to begin with the singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he weep, little talent to have, is Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">One sounds not only - at 50 singers people who hears, if a sound is going on?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search for the appropriate offer, seniors are various options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone sings out of the distant circle at a Seniorenchoir, you can easily close.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever would like to sing in a church in a church, can turn right into the church or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many Seniorenchirs you can also find on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whoever has no access to the Internet, can ask the family, friends or neighbours around the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whoever lust has to sing, it should be sure to close a choir and brokers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Let the soul fsing good and has something a little guy - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="26">It may be possible that further justifers groupings or infants constitute, the attacks against asylum seekers, plan against refugee camps or attacking from other legal trembling motifs.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the mage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are too, as late as it is too late, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro is nicely durable and permanently soft, an lawny race between competition and braces.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is when the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is intended for triathletes born to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not switch on TV, a paper read or during the discussion of your neighbours in the Wartsilica, without over Simone Biles, Katie Leopy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who plays for the first time at the Olympic Games and a lady of white with dimples, could have been carried out under these well-known names, which would be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-feeling TV commercial, if it would be a swimmers, Turner or even feeder.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting for the olympic beaten gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow, the sports species, which are not generally acknowledged: aerial hill shoot, Archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and do it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when I wanted to make arguments for my certain song, then let me leave the attention on the discreet charm of trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the tramp has already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been a Olympic event in Sydney, it was the last 16 years that many of whom I had asked, did not know that there is at any ever an Olympic Port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Igal.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA Athlete again sent a medal in the tramp division and made up a athlete until 2012, who made it until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women to divide the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jump has a certain outdoor side, partly because it sounds easy for an unsolved ear to a Clownsschule when responsible for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I was no idea, but only a dgebundener enthusiast bin.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling - but also the Grazie of Turnens and dives that combines two sports, which unites it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" was written by the Spanish El trampoline, meaning as much as "Jumping board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victorious winner jump almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a number of falling movements (shooting, heaters and salad) before leaving the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be rated according to the official Olympiaprogram to execution, degree of difficulty and "flying time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two female athletes of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in the Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their route to gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes up and back, to the top and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only pay the finishing line, but in the TV transmission, but in the TV transmission is another target: the world or the Olympiarekom.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted spreads is Nobel, admired food, even fanatic - and it is enough to bring up a audience to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also that what I feel themselves to watch this games as something tireless.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this, the trampoline offers an Attention.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolinspringers is the top.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prt down, seemingly heavy like a astronaut, goes back to the top, then moved back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vault into the distance, elegant uplift of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">Qualifying and final stages of women are held on Friday afternoon in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men start on Saturday, around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is crucial as part of a afternoon card on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who probably looked at the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness could only be achieved by attackers and the object-tification of male athletes - like it smote the male US-Turner according to The Wall Street Journal in front of the The Wall Street Journal, then Mr. Dooley expects his turn to the new fan.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation Protestant" in Ethiopia, Long's ally and the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators that require political changes in Ethiopia, threw down the government of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that only zig protesters were killed during clasps with the police killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a sturdy ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government occupied the country and far more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people embarked on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government was inbargain.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot and killed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, more than the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security sleek young people with bulls, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of Human Rights on Human Rights demands a incoming research.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to maintain this country and to future it is even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated to be the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence service works closely with the Ethiopian, in order to fight terrorism, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, when it is at all, so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia economy expanded in particular pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new Pendlerator in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually calm, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia had all other as an example of democracy - human rights organisations ongoing the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were brought into silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, or were driven into the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and press these no other options, it breaks out," said Seyoum Tesla, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protestant.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the soil use to dignity with regard to power of the governed coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a far-ranking critical election last year, the regaining party and its allies gain the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this zacky, controversial line required in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst feared that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less compute into recent years, that could rebuked more or less.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the feeding after years ago is now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopian were able to communicate by the social media, as the cheapest smartphones are more frequently more frequently and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government shut access to Facebook and Twitter closed what they do in regular intervals, especially with protests, do many people still communicate via Internet proxies that they hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian saw that she met at the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethylene in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Ethics, the Amharas, which are mainly coming from Ethiopia, mainly in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it does not change that.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are able to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominant of members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and dominate in the military, in the intelligence service, in trading and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-publication illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly confined in it, to use the early mark of unsatisfaction and the Special Representative to assess opponents and they are harmful to make their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this fundamental taste, Lord Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected as relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he did not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more blood-shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia lived such a tumult in 2005, after thousands of elections, according to the analysis of analytics, apparently committed by the government and subsequently were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following radar were killed many protesters, even if there were less than in the last months, and that time of unrest went quickly over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Foreign experts praised Ethiopian leader for its visionary infrastructure project, such as the new Pendlerator, as well as for its measurable progress in the poverty line.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this does not affect the intensive misuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month of print protesting in Gondar, a amharic city, of Tigray guided establishments and hatred to the Tigray gets more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests against the USA and other West allies bring to a strange position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenoughs on the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently announced that it has closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">During the West, Democracy wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to break his ally in a whole area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Lord Abdi, "is a very thin Grathike."</seg>

<seg id="3">This clarifying failed to communicate new issues of the presidential candidate from the Republicans for the Republicans whether it is able to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his fellow contingites, taking it during a refreshing phase in protection to the actual position to say that he could not have been meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the acceptance of a election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump has made reference to the assertion on Thursday and existed in interviews on Thursday that he was really not intended to signifying President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning, Mr. Trump, he was just straighted.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the contrary to the previous day, at which Mr. Trump in a number of interviews said he meant the effort to be made perfect.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Trump wanted to destroy the testimony that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, the republican Presidency would not know it.</seg>

<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already killed Sarkasmus in his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July, he moved to criticism of criticism, when he thought that Russians should have Mrs. Clinics Entrans, but explained later "Natural I said."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows to move Mr. Trump into the linguistic borders in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of its methods, such as certain Embassies of his fans will be taken, such as they come, and then interpreted" clear "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication experts who contributed to the language of the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also, he is clever enough to keep his statements to keep enough, so that they can be interpreted on different species and way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted a still corrob, since its environmental values have gone back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a big lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally attempted to apologize himself for its provocative majority, he charged his critics, his statements, or his humor false.</seg>

<seg id="26">Prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them up, on every one of his words, and against him voiced.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the poor, poor "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't do it! "</seg>

<seg id="4">The menu on this day was somewhat modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plums pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with children," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both of the food historian.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "chop Suey" was a handled by the Chinese cuisine in the USA during bricks in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the Food Perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest cooperation, "A permanent meal," which will be published on Tuesday at the Harper publishing house, illustrated the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop on supper, a small, schnaukellosem Imbite in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock of Börsencrash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetables.</seg>

<seg id="13">"rich food were very popular," said Censman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver loaf and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from allocation and a little cheap which access the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine how many earth may eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinste.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have laid in the stomach as lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in a American budget, especially in rural areas, all-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women boiled for male military workers and it was served fresh pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the American citizens to be hungry for the first world of World War. "A Square Meal" draws the way up, with which the country had to be destroyed, no more the Schlaraffenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in the food for the Americans a central theme, there was a central theme," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">The same reason was the new budget: mysterious meals like Brote and Casserolls were able to realize the casserolls as a "wonderful kind, Essensreste," understood Ziegelman to hide the unappetite ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry obst.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat that was a longlasting of the centre of the American cuisine, was in a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Specifically designed mixtures, since a calorie-rich and nourished satisfaction was precedented or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research on the book, which comprises recipes, he prepared a dish from this epoch, refried onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to the lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions are not sliced each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the laundry recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As had never before, the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, among them Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country.</seg>
<seg id="33">By doing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "domestic donations" and the challenge, pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historic Leckerbsen.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports about the answer of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me cakes and food-attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly presented the simple Iowa farmhouses in his kitchen, he spoke the same as the millionth major man of the world to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine as fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a fine dining room, and carried a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightful realm.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would have committed the same mistakes that if not his wife Eleanor would have been asked him to static with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book a housekeeper with no interest in taste of taste through Mrs Roosevelt, that the White House produced the boring food in Washington, but also one of the most trougly prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression with eating, was discarded when the country was back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The powers on our continued focus on calories and food, it was brickering, as well as science on food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple agreed on when writing the eating habits of Zipmans-law-in-law-law - for example as they could not throw food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of the disappearance of food," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman remembered: "she was actually sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the windshielding fall.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plate was cleared at Eisenberg's cleared, they pulled them and prepared a dessert, which it had prepared at home: the pegmendessors did eat the President Roosevelt in lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it will be called Prune Whip," says Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick, modest receped to miss a nice name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no proposed cream, plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrine is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rare view.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hair usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was moved to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland Hair dryers only got up with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although the Greenland was flooded on the north of the North Atlantic in an hour, on average, average is 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it comes up, the five-metre long animal speeds up to 2,6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this by longitude of loneliness seems, but a patron concept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen, among the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" in any case of a Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," comment by Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span that means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the Evolutionsbiologist suspected that Greenland hair is being grown.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence is missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland Hair-sharks are difficult to observe, they live mainly in the Eismeer in front of the thin defeat in the coast of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because it's temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, dive them in the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of the Greenland-based scientists have been correspondingly to little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time stamp deposition she, when they were able to spend six animals in front of Svalbard six animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beating this sharks yet: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had shot the pine bone of a young ice cream.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they are sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and search in Kadaver, which turns out of higher water tubes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues turned 28 Greenland-haia, fishermen between 2010 and 2013, as co-catching from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502-centimetre length was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of animals, they analyzes them with the Carbon-14 method to the lens of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This Centre of the eye lens was created before the birth of Haie, which contained in the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as Atomic waffenforging larger amounts of this radioactive carbon.</seg>
<seg id="26">In conjunction with 220 centimeters long, the lens of the lens contained a low overhead to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All bigger Grönlandhaia had arises its carbon-14-amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 watch for a 493-centimetre-long Greenland's age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters would even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland female became only offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, researchers have seen the length of an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was established with 156 years, Grönlandhaia with the surge obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even that could be the world record for Vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methodalos live mainly in its icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland, whose neck was on the neck of an 120-year-old harpoon Gun, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures, the organism of the animals live on asparasants.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they reeds later - and aging slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing, much faster than its surface planted by the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than in a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it, as possible as possible as possible many descendants, explains the Evolutionsbiologist.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with their hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere had been proved to be proven in the conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have a thin, erdful atmosphere, and still slowly turned back.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model lit also the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet is presumably more dry areas than the earth, but had enough water and geographic variability to harbor life and rapidly evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus and Venus in the sun was almost two months," explained GISS entist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain, that creates a thick layer of clouds which looks like a umbrella out to remove the surface of a large majority of solar warmth.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Weltraumtelescope helped astronomers helped to collect the complete catalogue on rotation rates under the stars of the constellation of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data are to understand the astronomers, why are stars in starfish, as well as in which the Rotation periods are standing with planetary process.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope we hope by the Compare of our results with other star, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Plejaden is 445 lightyears from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">A lot of stars in this constellation were created around 125 million years ago, now the adult age is now.</seg>
<seg id="7">They turn now at the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">To top of peak rates, these stripped stars large amounts to starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since this winds are travelling by the magnetic fields of the stars, they have an effective effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">If a star is getting old, its rotation rate starts at slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by giving the time between the appearance of an recognizable star flecks -- like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates shows that massive stars slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, though larger stars are slower piroubles than smaller.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors could add massively to be massive, while against faster rotors will add a very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmish laboratory to get rid of qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the constellation of the Plejaden, offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's still much before we would like to learn more about how like, Wann and Why stars will slow their rotor speed and appearing their "dancing shoes."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmer by pressing malware belts are currently targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware untary Specialists, Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany were at least once, 40 percent of those surveyed companies in the past twelve months, some victims of an attack with tackers software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany alone, nearly 20 percent of companies had already been a target of a Ransomware product.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims payed delivered by the perpetition required to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their expressors software according to the observations of Malwarebytes, on an attack on attacks in company network.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are successful there, the potential to erpreserve extinction significantly higher than in privacy.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently running a scary fast evolution of the polluting software," says Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most folk programs were designed to support advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpeted expressant software was discovered.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change of the company was sreckoned quickly in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once upon the computer of a breath, looking for incomprehensively changed files such as WordPress, Excel- or database files, as well as archives images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files are encrypted using the Ransomware and deletes originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software will be presenting the receivables of the pressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, victims must have the victims of money - usually in the form of the cryptography - Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where privacy uses the personal photo database on the game, it goes with companies to sensitive clients or project databases, without shut down the production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage exceeds the damage when Ransomware sank.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even the business activities had to break completely in a case of human being.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of health preceding.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we don't say to the victims," pays you only the problem "" "Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it's difficult to reject the processing of perpetrators in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know, and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security forscher of F-Secure accounts for use areas and contact with the expressors, and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to provide a type of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free access sites on or decrypt otherwise example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be dissolving their privacy according to payments of a few hundred euro, companies must pay hard-negotiate and fifteen totals to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risololites winnings from the Ransomware-expressant, the hacker is always professional and share the work, explains safety-sexy Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware of roughly within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is likely that there are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell your damage software in the form of a software building to the actual Erpressors.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool, so small configurations, appearance and fire can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressors are then looking for further hacker that bought the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one loggers in one of the forums in the foreground, the set of a crime and instructs another order to install the software as a lot of PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inferized calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals bear spammer with spreading," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">By many companies, the risk of Ransomware is now known to secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies-IT responsibilities included in the Malwarebytes survey to trust Ransomware using file-back-ups and Scannerssoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient for successful exploration, the perpetrators are based instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or price kalns," by Malwarebytes of Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential for the type of data even more than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also be completely new targets on the internet of things on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the horizon Conference Defects demonstrated security forces, such as they were able to receive the thermomostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the acquisitions of a derart blocked heating so manchem victim to be a ransom value.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one gets around for ever, at night it is stundenlong, in the morning, already far from the wake-up balls are no longer thinking about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all others as relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, you can find such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep problems and more than ten percent take their sleep frequently or permanent than not working.</seg>
<seg id="5">How external problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be varied causes of several causes, stressed Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for pharynolds and sleep medicine.</seg>

<seg id="8">Just that, many people are regarded as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German Hoist Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What ′ s behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>

<seg id="13">"very early today, especially at a depression often," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors are threaten.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who has a cervical herniated disc can be badly, awakes every two to three hours and begins to salute over all-day problems and ensure a example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should I sleep with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep over a period of one month in at least three nights a week, should not sleep well on the day, should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look different from different: it is beaten, fainted, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritated, has abstained or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To linking the sleeping mind, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a therapeutic options come from among other behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy, or medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases, and at the most for two weeks - demand.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, Prof. Ingo Fixed, head of the interdisciplinary medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>

<seg id="26">For examinations in the sleep laboratory, medical prescribed for example with respiratory symptoms, in illness and if you do not find the cause of a breakthrough sleep, explained fibrillation.</seg>
<seg id="27">You must not prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">It should be normal to day.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please make no lunch slips," says spruce.</seg>
<seg id="30">Following the shortens, one goes into the bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body you can stick a rhinestones, chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is also a camera to the ceiling to the ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="34">There are fairly many mount screws, where one can sleep for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß is on: regular sleep and weddings, not to long in bed, not to sleep, not to sleep, not to sleep, alcohol most, and at night does not start at the clock - then we begin to reckon, and that's all, and all is not conveyed.</seg>

<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the permanent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are illustrated in the last weeks but is illustrated with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents are occupied by the ground floor, however, rooms are still occupied spaces and are utilised for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the Berlin interior, on the beginning of the year, an hard demonstration of the police have been pronounced against the project, the area known as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June, on 22 June the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were evacuated, with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers was commissioned by the unfamiliar building owners of the premises.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearing had been illegal, and a day later, police and builders under the Jebel of Sympathisants and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents are going to walk with children, people sit on the offices in front of the houses in the sun, others stop spatii.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are a primary school and kindergardens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main oral of many calls: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who has been living here for three children, mostly from the police officer.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects, they worshipped the worry before increasing and Gentiles.</seg>
<seg id="15">It sounds not just after a pine, who wants to have a holistic polliners prior to the left-left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Graben, the Berlin Philharmonic, and the police between troops and their neighbours, is evidently not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin actually was a traditional employer, which is also in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are also numerous houses and the property of living projects are already long to the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR, among them almost the whole mainland road near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under large police officers, many of the projects had legalised in the Rigaer and are still occupied by people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district is increasingly becoming increasingly for tourists and Election liner from around the world: with them, Annatives from GDR times and former HAUSBESETZER are their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This can also be found in the Mieten, which has increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuilds in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they detect it on the broken disc or freshly knitted Facades which were subjected to color-wraps.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street this year was so often associated with the word "linksautonomous Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that, not all the neighbours cannot see the problem that they are not necessarily be affected by criminality: offenders such as body injuries, according to statistics according to policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make the damage to the newbuilding, tends to meet the newbuilds and freshly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house for 17 years along with the controversial 94 years, uncertainty of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violent acts, it is quieter: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, which should not be determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars give it directly to the Rigaer already longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, its road is not a criminal burning fuel, on the contrary: "it helps one another who lives together on the street and gets more apart, than what else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately moved to the Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was so important that the inhabitants are looking back to their road: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all claim the interpretation through the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of inhabitants as new building, the road will continue to be taken away: by disarming newbuilding in the former building, which landmarks the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are finally finally condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so far gorge," says it.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Violence and Destruction can I not theirs."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should I do when someone listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is on all pages Fruits, also in the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For a trailed painting, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the jams and the left scene was belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who moves, should be aware of his - just as someone who gets in a leiving area there is bad about noise.</seg>

<seg id="5">Social education supports the team of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It looks as a support for all players: refugees, Working Group for refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who knew else else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer base suggests that the volunteer has more than thankful, that Deuschle is now there is a diligable wool of Wollumau, which has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For instance, some - less splicited than rather to explore the multitude of desired zones that wanted to write the position as the administration.</seg>
<seg id="9">We wanted to find an administration force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a eiving Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not its central area, weep Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially the organization, work with people in front of the place and behind the scenes and networking activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has a 50-percent stop to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was highest time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle Ehren- and General Public Actors supports.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small issues, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New container in the WasRoute</seg>
<seg id="17">There has been a serious problem to find it since some time, apartments for the wiring fleets, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to accommodate refugees in own or registered living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of this accommodation must have the communes itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibilities changes from the land, commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but everyone wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it was not functional, yet to be instructed on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, we need to be chased out of the city, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon you will find new container in the WasRoute.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with flats it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a solid lead, training places, training places, training courts, one-euro jobs and expecting activities for refugees and migrants who are greased or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help master's useful work - and motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work leads to an positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That be "no employment therapy".</seg>
<seg id="35">Worked, but doesn't think work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should have to develop a breeding feel.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there will be special offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially voice courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional classes are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So I also skip here to administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central, that the refugees could get the feeling in Germany, and welcome them.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long time of procedure is a problem.</seg>
