the relation between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u was cl@@ amped since years .
Washington critic@@ izes the Israeli sett@@ l@@ ements of Israel and ra@@ ises Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u @-@ lack of peace in peace process .
by Obama finding the I@@ ran@@ ian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two is wor@@ sen@@ ed .

another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
on previously , the Delta State University had asked for health reasons for health reasons and said that it is some health problem .
he was only two online courses in this year .
latest changes in the employment policy of the University meant that the doc@@ torate , which was hard to do so hard , for him no guarantee for an automatic way to an application as Assistant Professor .
in addition , the president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said that he knew nothing of a conflict between them and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something similar to Mr Lam@@ bs Concept . &quot;
these are questions which cannot answer any more .
after the run out of camp@@ us , the police later was later on Lam@@ bs , as he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ark@@ ans@@ as .
before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house around a mile south of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .

8 Re@@ fresh values indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump gets tr@@ ump .
some have tried to brand him as flop .
others have taken him as a jo@@ ke .
some are waiting for a break@@ through .
but it doesn &apos;t matter how to try a Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper right to move below , it does not work ( still ) .
ten of the last eleven national surve@@ ys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to ask him what makes it worth the chan@@ ces of real estate business means .
of course it is too early in the election period .
no claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
experts acc@@ entu@@ ate that this time was Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s guide to the asc@@ ending Herman C@@ ain , where he also won just a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had fighting in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Group Club for Gro@@ wth now you will recognize tr@@ um@@ ps through per@@ sever@@ ance and start their dollars to over@@ throw him .
here are some current envelop@@ es that point out the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l has not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Popular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ da@@ cy in mid @-@ June , showed that only two of the ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans have seen the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
approximately three of ten say that they have negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thir@@ ds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers GO@@ P had been to be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans were either &quot; exc@@ ited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be refused , &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben CAR@@ LO creates about the same enthusi@@ asm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; exc@@ ited &quot; vs. 40 percent , that is equal to tr@@ ump ) .
next to be enthusi@@ asm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ish@@ ments will mark the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump refused to be critic@@ ized for his bom@@ bing and mod@@ elling statements , 52 percent of the Liby@@ ans applic@@ ant vot@@ ers think that the real estate support is the right temperature to have an President , ABC news / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first privileg@@ ed state of the nation , state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the person@@ ality to a rul@@ er , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent , however , that it was not the person@@ ality to perform their office , and almost six out of 10 witnesses , that his temperature is not into the White House p@@ asse , ABC / Post .
repub@@ lican vot@@ ers acc@@ li@@ ged to the idea .
when they set their money be@@ ware , repub@@ lican vot@@ ers will keep tr@@ ump on real .
when they asked if the GO@@ P nom@@ ination will be asked , following a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C in the last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time , when four of July left her money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete closure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers in the past did not know the cle@@ ar@@ est cryst@@ als in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination to just 28 % for final candidates .
non@@ eth@@ eless , however , a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers recru@@ ited Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aign as pl@@ au@@ si@@ bel .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around one other candidates , Tr@@ ump still strikes yet .
some experts as@@ sign that the frag@@ ment@@ ing field probably work too Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is distributed to more than a do@@ zen of other candidates diff@@ use .
but a survey conducted by the mouth @-@ University in early September shows that a hyp@@ oth@@ et@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head races between Tr@@ ump and most other repub@@ lican candidates , tr@@ ump majority support .
he recently got 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Wal@@ b Bush 19 points and finally from Rand Paul , John Kas@@ er and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggest@@ s it ?
Ben CAR@@ LO would pick up the entrepren@@ e@@ urs with 19 points in a hyp@@ oth@@ et@@ ical head @-@ race .
a short majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday will show that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers support , they say that they have occupied their voices .
of course , much happened to change that , and no one can really say , never to change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of the other outer se@@ ab@@ ites , the Neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Carson , but vot@@ ers who have formed their opinion , are twice as frequently for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they have to agree with tr@@ ump on the subject of immig@@ ration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump of his election campaign organised two months ago from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ers , &quot; was the immig@@ ration and fishing in public dis@@ course 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bing expression of tr@@ ump @-@ cru@@ cial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans are re@@ mot@@ ely hold by the Repub@@ lican Party and the new@@ ori@@ ent@@ ment efforts will become damaged .
but after the new ABC / post survey conducted on Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they have to agree with tr@@ ump on issues of migration .
as long as long there remains a hike in the lim@@ el@@ ight , it will do Donald Tr@@ ump appar@@ ently .
the fru@@ stration about the government cl@@ adding new high@@ s .
by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Carson , there is now around half of the support of Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers , mainly through its out@@ se@@ ab@@ ites status .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they want to prefer a political park as someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; very satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; stations . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . , the five exclusive residential areas in Germany
the Ho@@ book@@ en@@ weg can find the most expensive community - with view over the North Sea .
the road costs another square metre square house on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is limited to which means it is in the study - so the high price .
a new study shows that which specific locations are one square meter , most of them .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student union in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top residence , one of the price lists like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
real estate services provider Angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has released a leaderboard ranking of the exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ ering prices in the enormous heights .
there are several ten@@ ths of a thousand Euros twice - per square meter , well @-@ made .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and G@@ tze
two @-@ fold Tor@@ sch@@ actors in Pir@@ aeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a running .
a happy result of Thomas Müller &apos;s W@@ FC Bayern hit the way to a dil@@ ig@@ ent 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ acos Pir@@ aeus - then it was running .

the twel@@ f@@ th Star@@ ter@@ speed in series should be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally will finally pick the H@@ enk@@ el@@ p@@ ott to Munich .
Müller was awarded him for his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavaria @-@ guided Mi@@ th@@ ening of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had taken one of the el@@ ab@@ ul@@ sion of the World Champion behind him .
&quot; we will not appreci@@ ate &quot; had Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 688 days of h@@ ott@@ y fans - and the Munich lasted more .
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without going to gl@@ aze .
Pir@@ aeus had gained his youngest six home games in the p@@ inn@@ acle , including Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund was proud in Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European cup du@@ els with Greek teams , won &apos;t want to be the next sacrifice .
they were encour@@ aged to work with their ob@@ vious efforts to work with works .
the attacks were ro@@ uted to often by hanging direc@@ ting on Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa , which had an encrypted attack against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i .
Müller had more fortun@@ ate more fortun@@ ate than his flanges in the left upper row in the left .
in the 67@@ . minute the world champion gives the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occas@@ ions in half of one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , when the Olympi@@ ast@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown is defeated the head ball of Poland of the Pol@@ es ( 26 ) .
then , by Direc@@ tion , the Tor@@ ke@@ Roberto with the Kn@@ ie par@@ ed ( 35@@ th ) .
though the Bavaria you had a very domin@@ ant game , pir@@ ates re@@ placing its re@@ con@@ if@@ ers .
but ke@@ eper Manuel new was convic@@ ted .
that was about , when he fle@@ w an shot of Ide@@ as on the fle@@ ece ( 5@@ 6. ) .
before New J@@ ardi@@ ola brought a quad@@ ruple with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng .
Mario Gö@@ tze , after mus@@ cular Probl@@ ems back in the k@@ ader , sitting outside .
the F@@ WC , the F@@ WC , only given after the end of the final , said Sport@@ vor@@ stood Matthias Sam@@ mer near &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
for the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided in charge of him when he had King@@ sley Com@@ an for the seventh Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Gö@@ tze arrived late for Art@@ uro V@@ idal ( 76@@ . ) and made it all for 13 minutes later , by the El@@ f@@ m Müller was still one dr@@ auf .

after a smaller part of the subject of Bavaria fans in their vie@@ wers , the p@@ endants of host Pir@@ aeus , with words and ear@@ liest pro@@ vo@@ iced , the security forces entered and went off against the Munich Pendant .

anyone who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of los@@ ing teeth
those who smo@@ kes , doesn &apos;t har@@ m it at the lung , but also the teeth - this places in Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study close .
the good news : at Ver@@ ily , the risk of quickly drops rapidly .
smoking have a much increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this goes from the long @-@ term study of an international research team including several associates of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking poll@@ s in smoke inhal@@ ers , their teeth fall early , in order to increase the 2.@@ 5- and 3,6 @-@ fe@@ ars higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main cause for denti@@ sts be c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ation of the tooth fl@@ are , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is an risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the connection between smoking and to@@ oth@@ loss can therefore return to frequent root @-@ inflamm@@ ation in smoke inhal@@ ings .
not clar@@ ified , however , too large smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who heard with the smoking , their risk could reduce the risk of the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could last more than ten years until the compan@@ ion@@ ment is back to the level of non @-@ rep@@ u@@ ity , explained the first au@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
you need to con@@ vin@@ ce people of it , non @-@ smo@@ kers , declar@@ ing the H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ened the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for l@@ ungs and vessels and leads to our in@@ sight for good dental health up to the high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population is affected in the age of 65 to 74 years , the DI@@ F@@ E also divided .
earlier studies have already noted that smoking the risk of early g@@ over@@ s increase .
the new long @-@ term study enter@@ tains the findings .

EU Commission pro@@ poses in disp@@ ute over TT@@ IP &apos;s new court
the European Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration system &apos;s current national trade agreement of the embr@@ ance on the intended trans@@ atl@@ antic free trade agreement .
the contro@@ versi@@ al private lighting equipment for disp@@ utes between shows and nations are to be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds to more traditional courts in its functionality .
&quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; the local EU Comm@@ ission@@ er Cecilia Malm@@ ström has been introducing the performance .
the Swedish @-@ din st@@ ipul@@ ates the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade union talks with the USA .
the German Government has announced support .
the world &apos;s largest Free Trade Area with 800 million people will be created .
the plans for reform of the current ar@@ bit@@ ration procedure will see concrete that the EU Member States and the USA will select an independent judge for a new investment plan .
they are supposed to come to the same parts from the EU , the USA , and from third countries .
the first time fore@@ seen is a second instance .
it would allow it to lift up against the jud@@ g@@ ments .
so far , the proceedings involved in ar@@ bit@@ rators , a ple@@ dges against their jud@@ g@@ ments were not given .
in the discussion of last months , you have become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of Fair@@ ness and Justice did not confi@@ dential , comm@@ ented Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , she wants to work according to a International Investment Tribunal .
for example , there could also be clar@@ ified between Chinese companies and EU Member States .
the Invest@@ or @-@ Sta@@ ats @-@ ar@@ bit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) mainly rel@@ ates to the large resistor for the large resistance in Europe against the TT@@ IP .
the traditional ar@@ bit@@ ration practices are critic@@ ized by opp@@ onents as a parall@@ el@@ just@@ ification of control of damage to control the corpor@@ ations , national laws , or a decrease of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statement , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations as Camp@@ act suggest@@ s proposals from the EU Commission as in@@ adequate .
the agreement was critic@@ ised for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Economic State Secretary of Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) signed the plans for a major progress .
the Commission must take into account for the reform of public points , the Federal Minister for Finance , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade minister .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut at the Quest@@ ion of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s has been committed to the Prime Minister &apos;s Quest@@ ion , Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s .
the new Labour Ch@@ air@@ woman Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is alleged to announce his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Quest@@ ion of Prime Minister and Minister David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is going to rise in order to stay at first of his six hours , where his performance was probably checked and the Labour MP@@ s from the neighbour@@ hood .
he called &quot; fewer Theater and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he has also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to ski@@ p them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leadership , because it comes after his appointment to a member of the Shadow @-@ based Ch@@ urches and of his speech at TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Committee , on Tuesday during the 75@@ th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence for the 75@@ th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , foc@@ uses on the heart of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands in the center of several front page Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s decision , not sing to the national an@@ them , has drawn attention .
a spokes@@ person for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he could have stood &quot; in respec@@ t@@ ful silence &quot; and he took the &quot; abo@@ urs of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme to sing the National Council to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independ@@ ently of its belief that the mon@@ archy would be abol@@ ished .
nearly a do@@ zen of shade @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leading team , and it is called on differences in economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six@@ es of the parliamentary party originally supported it as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Schulz said that political differences should also be st@@ acked in labour camps , namely , to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s pr@@ ono@@ unc@@ ements to the European Union and the limit .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour Ch@@ ed@@ ity to remove the whole idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of the shadow and minister @-@ ministers said that it is very clear &quot; that they may only reduce the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth rul@@ er ch@@ air@@ woman who David Cameron , ever since he became T@@ ory Chef in the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour Ch@@ air@@ woman who has a state Secretary , says that &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ Sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions submitted to Mr. Cameron and has given more than 30.000 suggest@@ ions .
the Isl@@ ington North MP has said that the frag@@ ments of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ al , and that it is subject to with@@ ers , and that it is under@@ estimated to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , in@@ equality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow econom@@ ist minister him will be represented , if he is not part@@ ed - for example if Mr. Cameron is on the road .
he also brought the idea into the conversation , that other colleagues can occasionally take into the word , and that he said John Ber@@ li , the spokes@@ person of the under@@ house , addressed to the problem .
when he was Leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he is ti@@ ed from the politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre . &quot; but a few years later , he dre@@ amed that he has shi@@ fted it in it .
as she first sent in television in 1990 , the frag@@ ments adopted by the prime minister of a leader and his leadership in under@@ house and his position among his par@@ li@@ aments , although crit@@ ics have ar@@ gu@@ ed , they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and re@@ mod@@ elling re@@ forms .

met@@ to start Bod@@ enst@@ än@@ s campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - Fail@@ ure
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA stores before a Al@@ di @-@ Up@@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food retail@@ er Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ speed campaign in order to def@@ end the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in the field of a $ 700 million Al@@ di @-@ invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers in South Australia and Western Australia in the very next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA super@@ markets will strengthen their relation@@ ships with local food suppliers and stores the brand I@@ GA by ma@@ instre@@ am marketing and marketing about the Social Media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump@@ ed on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ erst@@ eller Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA shops and shop @-@ shops , the remaining tickets for the South Australian soccer le@@ ague in loy@@ alty clients .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will be published further details of his defence strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ alers for fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ffs , alcohol and equipment passes their annual Invest@@ ors strategy .
there is a lot on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shop , com@@ prise more and higher profit margin as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern @-@ States .
South Australia and Western Australia are listed in the province of Australia and Western Australia as a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , an@@ alyst@@ s do as Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di was about twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the market market in these two states , and every dedicated ac@@ count@@ less sales are taken away .
a report published in this week published according to the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that I@@ GA retailers can sell 360 $ million per year and spend 250 million dollars each year by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ gn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and gro@@ cery store and the quantities of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost Met@@ cash approximately $ 13 million earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares loses its market shares mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan had found that I@@ GA @-@ bu@@ yers are the most likely to become .
Morgan Stan@@ ley is active that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenue in food and gro@@ cery store around 3.8 per cent in 2016 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 will reduce its market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.2 % by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is probably dis@@ appear within a decade .
Met@@ cash ref@@ unded to re@@ act as public on the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is estimated that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass was added last week .
I@@ GA@@ s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s feed and food trade , which has fallen approx . 1,200 I@@ GA retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 per cent , which refle@@ cts the operating level of de@@ grad@@ ation in compensation and march .
the Grand dealer is however , invest@@ ing and invested more than 150 million $ in order to improve selling prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths , while impro@@ ving their stores due to fast @-@ growing fresh food and give a better choice of private label food .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjust@@ ments and shop san@@ itation programs to Elan , will be h@@ opes that the Grand dealer will return to return growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is des@@ erv@@ es rather than critic@@ ism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ ership &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and des@@ erv@@ es the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly more pra@@ ised as critic@@ ism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the tal@@ ented Du@@ os that will always be referred back as &quot; Special H@@ s , &quot; fell by the not@@ ori@@ ous mem@@ oriz@@ ation of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an WA@@ WR@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in the Cinc@@ inn@@ ati qualifying game in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati , later , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be separated from the ar@@ bit@@ rator , where Har@@ rison had to beat , &quot; WA@@ WR@@ IN@@ KA have had to beat after K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should strike the child . &quot;
during the last time he was seen as he crushed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a vap@@ or became a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , the Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is def@@ ended from He@@ aly .
te@@ ens is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in sing@@ les behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Britain .
&quot; one thing , about which I was fair@@ ly de@@ cent , is the fact that after my view was just a little in the disp@@ ute , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he is broken in a r@@ ack@@ et because he lost a bat in the US Open , but he is not the first player to destroy a bat from fru@@ stration among themselves , and I think Th@@ an@@ asi was good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , truly , he really stim@@ ulates in the US Open in the US Open , even under the fair@@ ly prov@@ oc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think it des@@ erv@@ ed much recognition .
he has got a great team around , he has a great family around , and I think he was treated a little too severe .
he is a lovely 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he still fits into the team and so on , he has never been doing a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think it des@@ erv@@ es it to be judged according to his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important pre@@ limin@@ aries who begin on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , as long as long @-@ term firm into the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition , and not all the contro@@ versi@@ es around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick very quickly made the way to support people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he gets all the critic@@ ism that he gets what it really can try to try him the consequences of its work . some time outside the r@@ amp , where he can only think about it , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary stated not@@ ices , clos@@ es the limit , maint@@ ains refugees
Hungary declared the emergency state and sealed the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim to stop the electricity current of mig@@ rants .
ch@@ aos sec@@ uted at the border , hundreds of mig@@ rants arrested in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land region and the Serbian government re@@ acted their in@@ dig@@ nation .
people escap@@ ed before violence that were escap@@ ed before violence against a well @-@ known time in a cross country between the two control points of the countries , and destroyed the tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations went up .
as a police helicop@@ ter on them , the mig@@ rants &apos; Opens the border ! &quot; and cried al@@ leg@@ ations against the Hungarian Re@@ union spo@@ liz@@ ei .
some point out of protest foods and water .
Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister declared , &quot; be &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that mig@@ rants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia to Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ als .
in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ bul@@ ences at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a str@@ it@@ arian meeting in Brussels .
the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40.000 people who were collected in superior Italy and Greece . they afflic@@ ted their hope that ulti@@ mat@@ ely - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement that the EU states would take an additional 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immig@@ ration of the continent .
but Hungary , however , set its h@@ opes on an early action in Brussels or from his neigh@@ bo@@ urs .
the Not@@ ice in two southern regions gave up more power to the conqu@@ est of the crisis , so that they could un@@ lock the streets and acceler@@ ate as@@ l procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country had also the construction of an Stach@@ el@@ í@@ tz@@ a@@ us along its border to Romania , to stop the con@@ current of mig@@ rants through the country , after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison seeds at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the last months , Hungary has become a considerable bott@@ len@@ ders in Syria and el@@ se@@ where the Middle East has become a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck and the input point into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had in@@ sist@@ ed that most in@@ coming economic refugees are in which the search for a better life are , and not con@@ feder@@ ates that are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in cont@@ radi@@ ction to other EU Member States , including Germany .
the new laws passed around midnight into force , the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall , to build the government along the southern border to Serbia in order to condem@@ n a crime . these laws counts even higher adhesion for condem@@ ning human tra@@ der .
&quot; due to the situation which arose by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; said spokes@@ person Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs representatives in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament has to be able to agree on the use of the military , which is expected to attend the next week , but rep@@ orter of Associ@@ ated Press have already been seen at the border of armed troops with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , Landes @-@ security advis@@ ors for the Or@@ ban , said that there were 45 people in attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 other were already de@@ eper into the country .
they come up by being damaged by the fence , they are now being imprisoned in police custody and are charged with off@@ ences against the new law .
authorities are to repair the fence up quickly .
Hungarian officials decided on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a stop wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .

election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s Jump to Bern@@ ie Sand@@ ers hal@@ ved in a national survey
Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to continue to take a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race to the nom@@ ination to national level , but Sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie Sand@@ ers winning their opposite to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of democratic vot@@ ers ( 58 per cent before ) , while sand@@ ers is on second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced his pre@@ sidency , he received support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers support .
more than five months before the election of the elections , the most democratic vot@@ ers say it is too early to say that their opinion is , which candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supp@@ orters are more resistant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton have lost some of dem@@ ographic groups during a number of dem@@ ographic groups .
Clinton holds a big lead to women and moder@@ ately , but these fo@@ jum@@ ps have decreased .
your support with the men have gone down , and in Sand@@ ers there are only 5 points back here .
Clin@@ tons Adv@@ antage for democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has become fully @-@ fle@@ dged , and they and sand@@ ers are now on the same height .
but Clinton still has a big lead to older vot@@ ers .
last month , Clinton in front of Sand@@ ers with two @-@ digit lead to the Liber@@ al , but Sand@@ ers has now had a 5 @-@ point lead at this group .
roughly half of the democratic vot@@ ers were well @-@ wide that they would support it with enthusi@@ asm into Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support it with some advance and support further 15 percent , they only support the candi@@ da@@ cy .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps even more sur@@ pris@@ ingly , Clin@@ tons of the current supp@@ orters can be thr@@ illed above all of her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who are currently supported Clinton in only about one quarter would be del@@ igh@@ ted .
while 48 percent of democratic vot@@ ers will say that they supported Clinton with enthusi@@ asm , claim@@ ing fewer repub@@ lican vot@@ ers more than their flag@@ ration data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
when Clin@@ tons station@@ ed in an open question , why they want the candidate &apos;s candi@@ da@@ cy is the most common answer ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clin@@ ton supports also their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
con@@ sent to deal with problems and the vot@@ ers are also quoted .
as the vice president of a potential for the pre@@ sidency , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers would like to see him in the race - though a third believe that he should not do it .
when democratic vot@@ ers asked the election if the party was their second choice , bi@@ ds is at the top .
by Clin@@ t Tag , more than half of the Bible att@@ ain@@ ted the second choice well in front of Sand@@ ers .
the be@@ ats , not decisive for the nom@@ ination of the Dem@@ oc@@ rat Party , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Sand@@ ers , increased from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers will see Clinton as a candidate with the best chan@@ ces to win the election ; however , this number has dropped from 78 percent in the last month .
be@@ ats is with a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the vote , has risen .
nevertheless , on the question that , what is more important for one candidates , German Democratic vot@@ ers call about the vot@@ ers .
similar to the last month , there was no ob@@ vious candidate of the candidate or potential candidate of the election .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates get good results for some important characteristics of their party vot@@ ers .
consider Clinton , sand@@ ers , and bi@@ ds as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leading ex@@ ecu@@ tives .
be@@ ating the three candidates the best starting at hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton &apos;s hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that about Sand@@ ers ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no reviews concerning him .
elections of the election generally indicate Clinton , Sand@@ ers and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with its views .
a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers , a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers , came in touch with all these measurements .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a Ser@@ vers are still provided as Foreign Minister , the majority of the executive cont@@ radi@@ ction are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that there are not all the opinions altogether .
but it is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans now is not satisfied with its explanation , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem of the light was turning .
most Americans say that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion was still det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton of the vot@@ ers of their party is hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them than hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the vot@@ ers do not keep it for an hon@@ est and tru@@ sted person .
at the same time 55 percent of vot@@ ers contributed also drinking water as well as non @-@ hon@@ orable and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump is given good notes to the lead .
out of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Carson and Bush the best in hon@@ esty .
a majority looks much more hon@@ est@@ ly than hon@@ est@@ ly , but as with Carson we have no reviews of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers is 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson travel@@ ed at land@@ es@@ next pol@@ l near Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Carson is situated on the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump

repub@@ lican vot@@ ers continue to continue tr@@ ump into large numbers . the support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted by Fox News debate in the past month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but there are in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey showed that there are well suited for dem@@ ographic groups and exceeds tr@@ ump under repub@@ lican vot@@ ers .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Govern@@ or John Kas@@ er , is ro@@ uted with Wis@@ con@@ sins Govern@@ or Scott Walker , which is fallen by 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
the former governor Govern@@ or Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are with 6 % on the third place .
the error mar@@ ge at the sample Sample of 376 people from Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l , which was published last week , indicates that there is over 19 % support in the poll@@ s , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed a tr@@ ump clearly higher .
with a look at one of the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side p@@ amp@@ ie@@ ves for former neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ geon , even after los@@ ing his debt , Tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .

a bath in North or Baltic is likely to be a rather short am@@ us@@ al at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some of this goes because no more into the sea : maximum 18 degrees Celsius has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , spl@@ itting the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) .

five members of the Br@@ otherhood in the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
nearly two years after a student during a man@@ ik@@ ido R@@ itu@@ als , a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , mass@@ ages are filed for five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta in charge of print Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a launch event in September 2013 , gross and del@@ ayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared with him .
when he said , he was filled with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack of the sand , and repeat@@ edly resulted in a frozen field on a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about he@@ ada@@ ches , and fell on un@@ bl@@ ess@@ ly .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ del@@ ta pet@@ rators are not called the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g has been strengthened and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to conf@@ usion D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothes to tell his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Br@@ otherhood , said Police minister Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ sil@@ ien and set the bro@@ ug@@ gling of the br@@ otherhood organized by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; Police President Wagner .
he was not revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning to his inju@@ ries .
after a car @-@ report , Den@@ g has been repeat@@ edly added with silent strength inju@@ ries on the head , hull and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; to many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Br@@ otherhood . at least one student has been killed every year in the sch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who passes his family in a declaration .
br@@ other@@ ho@@ ods and their members have to be moved to account , and this step by authorities are very important .
a County Grand Jury created a pro@@ secution for the first five members of the third gr@@ ades for the first five members .
thirty @-@ thirty members of the br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indicted for f@@ ik@@ an@@ ous attack and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to participate in the participating persons , but if there is an organization that has been officially - officially or un@@ officially - this will also go to account , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College is b@@ anned the br@@ otherhood , and national br@@ otherhood can re@@ vo@@ ke their cour@@ te@@ ness to the city .
it will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
there is a bill of interest , and the ho@@ ists will come into w@@ ender , yiel@@ ds yiel@@ ds for bonds , and the economy is g@@ over@@ ed into a rec@@ ession .
we do that .
what we do not know how long will take everything and how long it will stop .
in particular , the story of the economy does only contain small guide to the end .
a rec@@ ession occurred within only 11 months after the first interest of interest and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve of the Federal Reserve at the rates of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in doing what the economy and financial investments are re@@ acted .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank so intense ent@@ ru@@ sted that investors were not focused on these , when they begin to increase the interest rates , but rather re@@ prove to the period that are needed for normal@@ ization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
however , in the end , market participants could determine that the whole exc@@ it@@ ement may not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of a short@@ age .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is in@@ feed from some than a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ ek@@ om near Capital Economics , in a communication .
in contrast , we do not expect the sound return of US interest to normal tre@@ ble , but still on a low level to lead to the se@@ is@@ mic shock that seem to lead .
however this doesn &apos;t mean that there is no effect .
here is a historical trends Bas@@ ier@@ looking view to re@@ act as some areas of the economy could re@@ act :
like the market in the last month , the withdraw@@ al of interest increased things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l .
as soon as the increase hits , the influence is not so dram@@ atic .
&quot; there is apparent tend@@ ency from 12 to 24 months after the first raise what might refle@@ cts the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank an@@ alyst@@ s in a recent study , which has happened to interest increases the F@@ ed .
more specific , the market is usually in the last 35 years mostly in the up@@ ward trend - around 14 percent - on the way to the second increase , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent according to an current analysis , which Bob Doll , head plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects of the shares ten@@ ds to occur later in the investig@@ ational cycle and the yiel@@ ds begin to decrease .
Rez@@ essi@@ ons are a fact of economic life , but interest increased them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions which could not exist before and acceler@@ ate a rec@@ ession .
the GDP is remark@@ ably remarkable that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in the F@@ ed increase .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 second increase has been higher than the nominal GDP since 1950 , under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few , that it is expected and expected to expect for the third quarter following the Atlanta F@@ ed figures just 1.5 percent .
interest rate for a so frag@@ ile economic cul@@ ts could be risk and dis@@ card the question of whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken up the whole year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were judged by the Federal Open Market Committee on this week that ends on Thursday .
while many str@@ ate@@ urs and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could im@@ itate an increase in this meeting , there is a decrease of 25 percent in this meeting .
&quot; in our study , all de@@ cav@@ ities from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing the weak@@ ening of GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ eptions are very quickly after the beginning of the recovery in the shadow , &quot; so the report .
in contrast , this is a clear rec@@ tive recovery of what the worst rec@@ ession was observed in the follow @-@ up period .
the current cycle has long been longest until the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
the fixed income also was vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market is a second increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds faster than in shares , changing its strategic course .
the yiel@@ ds appear to change the returns , once the first raise / decrease in the cycle is made .
at the end of the investig@@ ating cycle , the bond yiel@@ ds down immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the Str@@ ate@@ urs of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead , yiel@@ ds between longer and shorter bonds , and contri@@ bute to a bend of the curve .
highly @-@ interest bonds often bring in such a climate better development , although &quot; we are yet c@@ auti@@ ously to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ an@@ alyst@@ s in sw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it &apos;s interesting to know that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the drop of inflation , there are some evidence that the market has been adapted to the view of rig@@ orous monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the trag@@ eous hum@@ ility is flat , credit con@@ ten@@ sions have increased , and the volumes contrac@@ ted - all features of the market if the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in the big and whole companies , roll up the larger part of their activities in the USA , benefit , if interest rates are rising and local products are more effectively .
mult@@ in@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high debt will be worse , as an increasing dollar is more expensive on the global market , as well as financing of their deb@@ ts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares claim@@ ing strongly to re@@ act three months after a initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ an@@ alyst@@ s responded to the customer .
companies with strong record , companies with weak balance after each of the cement increased in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 aver@@ aged around 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital margin as well as low Equ@@ at@@ ility and low Equ@@ at@@ ility met its portfolio with lower quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts are become a great issue .
businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest will most likely , Gold@@ man said .
out of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from increasing the dollar .
Spar@@ er could see gains of higher income , even if experts have a different opinion , as soon as the experts will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliamentary member of Andrew B@@ ingham

&quot; Radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; tri@@ fool@@ ish &quot; - but it seems to trans@@ form to Classic@@ FM , &quot; he said .
he also aims at the BBC Music Awards , which began in last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - this are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples , in which you &apos;re actually just the im@@ it@@ ating , which is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director proved to be back and ar@@ gu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is concerned about its commercial compet@@ itors , when it goes to the public music and keeping of the public .
what I learn about Radio 3 ? I will learn about classic music anywhere else .
it is a dedication to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , new music to find and new works in order , I also get for important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey prev@@ ail@@ ed that hard to eng@@ age worked together to eng@@ age the audience as it was informed in the past because the British have been informed about classic music .

Internet sales in August at s@@ lower and black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sale .
last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in the year 2000 .
online sales reinforced three years ago through the use of mobile phones
experts believe that the Black Friday in November die is bra@@ ked
for more than a decade , the virtual shopping is bo@@ oming , and many of the main shopping streets of the UK have turned in spirits .
however , experts say that the online revenues were stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers were only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that online sales will be stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers were only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for years , and then return to 2000 , then in the course of the time , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index was the Guardian .
he declared that the online sales increased three years ago , when bu@@ yers began to make bu@@ yers with their cell@@ phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and could do that people could do this in different environments , such as home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ end itself , and we may see that the growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenom@@ enon is imported from the America , is c@@ ited as a reason for the subsequent sales .
experts believe that bu@@ yers will hold its purch@@ ases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , Sch@@ arte describes the average number of bu@@ yers around their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some merch@@ ants sites jump@@ ed off .
experts believe that Black Friday , aimed at the bu@@ yer &apos;s bu@@ yer due to bu@@ ck@@ ling bu@@ yers that could stop the bu@@ yer &apos;s purch@@ ases .
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that out of 5 £ spending slightly more than £ 1 being online .

functional of A@@ ich / DO@@ B due to un@@ faith@@ fulness in court
in the Kl@@ agen@@ furt , the Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two functional function of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball championship A@@ ich / DO@@ B have to answer in@@ loy@@ alty and dis@@ agreement .
the accused pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with illness .
on May right , he was acqu@@ itted on May right .
the current process was ad@@ journ@@ ed .
according to the Att@@ orney Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused was cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the accused were allowed to submit their functions in the years 2006 to 2011 .
with approximately 400.000 euros , it is required to damage the damage .
the sports @-@ functional are also charged with finance .
this f@@ are@@ well was leaving the Ch@@ air@@ woman of the Op@@ ener , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the failure of un@@ faith@@ fulness the defence counsel that the association was fixed at no time .
the sports activities had been calculated or accounts for the sports club , which had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in whom they had invested much time and money , from the liabilities - the Pas@@ si@@ va was around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euros ) .
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : can we continue the club further or cut off ? , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in a bread prof@@ ession of the financial crisis .
then , with his colle@@ ague and co @-@ def@@ endants he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have fin@@ alized money , having laid out our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; he said in the intervention . &quot;
with the club has been agreed : you can manage the money , it may only be made deb@@ ts .
furthermore - in respective financial assets - the payout of the current accounts has been decided until 1991 .
as a result , a part of the quantity of accounts not only years later , namely , from 2003 , as an increase in the account was paid out .
therefore , the l@@ ump - and not detailed canc@@ ers on , the former ob@@ mann explained the processes .
accounts and savings were accused of the accused , said the second def@@ endants .
why the withdraw@@ als were not ob@@ li@@ ged in detail in detail , the judge asked .
the association did not have interest in detail for financial investments here only the debt of debt might have been doing so the answer .
in 2011 , when the investigation had an function@@ ing investigation into Am@@ t@@ sm@@ ell space , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the territory .
these rel@@ atives have been , declared the def@@ endants .
this securities con@@ es came to the name of the second def@@ endants , and it was not known to the club &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know this judge .
on the occasion of the questions long no answer .
then he finally meant to believe that this is the best for the club .
if something happened to happen if nobody knew something from this money , the so@@ lic@@ itor set out in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants must be informed , just@@ ified the function@@ ally .
this transl@@ ator was form@@ ulated as &quot; claims handling . &quot;
why claims handling ? , wanted to know judge and pro@@ secutor .
it was stated that the first accused began to agree with this form@@ ulation because the association was never a damage .
but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; with whom all of you are all of the tail@@ or . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for US @-@ scale
the world is observed when the U.S. state database was on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade ago , or not .
a survey among 80 Ö@@ kon@@ omen carried out by Reuters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do something longer , and the interest rates will be reduced by 0 to 0.25 percent .
it &apos;s a historic event because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est to N@@ ULL forces .
for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank is possibly off the zero area and will begin to start a process of normal@@ ization rates , &quot; said Angel En@@ aut , Executive staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is added to a relatively high performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate only a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ign@@ ore the less ro@@ sive focus on global conditions .
she war@@ ned the markets to increase to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chan@@ ces of opportunities are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday .
notes at the Delta State University leaves compensation
after the shooting and killing of his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning , and before he killed his colleagues in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , on Monday morning , before he could say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that he was a lec@@ turer for Ge@@ ography and social sciences Education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and said he was shot at someone else and someone killed .
on the staff of the emergency call , the police officer must send out the police officer to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife &apos;s evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house be , but he &quot; no one will dist@@ ur@@ b , &quot; but probably will be exc@@ ited .
the police asked the hearing after his name , but he gave him not .
no explanation for his shots .
as a police called the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note by car , 45 , the said , &quot; I do it so lei@@ d , I wanted to do it back .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
following the writing of the note , he ro@@ uted 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ emen cru@@ el him .
in addition , the president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said that he knew nothing of a conflict between them and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something similar to Mr Lam@@ bs Concept . &quot;
in spite of reports on Monday , which was supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there will be no information , no evidence &quot; for an &quot; triangle @-@ relationship . &quot;
Sha@@ wn of the Sha@@ wn of O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who spoke about seven years , was described as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced by 15 years ago , and remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss already had a daughter who is 19 , and they be destroyed &quot; at the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , in statement by L@@ ins@@ day Kn@@ ow@@ les , which was identified as a close @-@ friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss from Sun Her@@ ald .
Kn@@ ow@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , who had taken care of them since about three years .
&quot; they wanted to help others , &quot; said Kn@@ ow@@ les
the police said , on a certain date called on Monday , to say to them , &quot; he should not go into prison . &quot;
as polic@@ emen came on off Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , the car drove to the side , fled to foot , running in the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 , he received a Ph.@@ D. from the Delta State University , like his cur@@ ri@@ au on the website of the University .

I Sh@@ aw by Manchester United can not play a double @-@ correction for a double @-@ correction
in the PS@@ V Eindhoven , Luke Sh@@ aw suffered a double @-@ correction of his right hand at the end of the PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while carrying out the le@@ ft@@ ly def@@ ended blo@@ ody for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ aal does not have hope that Sh@@ aw can play back in this season .
the viol@@ ation of Hé@@ ctor was caused by a re@@ frac@@ tional attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sh@@ aw was in the PS@@ V range .
it was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was put into hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double bass structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow , he will be moved to tomorrow or possibly a day later , then in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then really play it , and then it happens .
in the dressing cabin , he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double correction , then lasts for six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season back again .
mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and a hanging of a penalty .
Nicola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the ar@@ bit@@ rator , did not pun@@ ished the Mexican .
van G@@ aal believes that the Italian ar@@ bit@@ rator had wrong wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty stro@@ kes and a red card could be paid .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et at Sh@@ aw account saying : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe them how broken me , my way to the gen@@ ius is now , I come back on . &quot;
refer@@ ring to Manchester United also suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sh@@ aw in the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the European Championship in France has an additional appe@@ aling to re@@ cover up to the next June .
Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad inj@@ ury . &quot;
if a player in viol@@ ation of inj@@ ury left the place , all are very sad .
it is never the inten@@ tion of our players to inj@@ ury a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland @-@ crew during the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his inten@@ tion to inj@@ ury the opponent , and when you hear that there is a very bad inj@@ ury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another way towards the way , so that it touched when he could see &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it fe@@ els , I know how hard to be something like that .
I feel really bad there . I &apos;m sorry for me .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ és has also been put into hospital after a f@@ oul@@ spiel of Chris Sm@@ aller .
probably David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing to learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take time until you know almost out .
unless you are , you may be David Cameron
when he was asked by a supplier of child care services to call his favorite text@@ book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , founded in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron into a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continued : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to give my children , because it seems like a painting or a message which we have to have changed . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent one , in which Cameron is supp@@ os@@ edly describes the presentation of the book written by 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the quite short text message .
&quot; in the middle of the silent city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature itself has gone and even the air named Ted , the heart of Au@@ drey , to see his wish to see a real tree , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , and the 1991 died , but totally unknown .
as if that &apos;s not yet enough , the text appeared in by Cameron , like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is based on the website of Internet Movie Datab@@ ase , where everything is synthetic and even the air is a product , h@@ opes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ drey , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he is sur@@ prised to be a pr@@ ag@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron trig@@ gered the hand@@ book of the Bu@@ ches so much . here hear a un@@ named after the prot@@ ests of nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a hollow , gra@@ dient , &quot; which speaks in the name of trees , &quot; is des@@ olate .
most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task was ad@@ vised by a hel@@ per , who did not read the lor@@ ax for another 20 times consecu@@ tively in a child .
an Down@@ ing @-@ Street spokes@@ person said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ oon &apos;s office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ oon employees was delivered , but was no other appro@@ ach@@ able comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clear evi@@ dent from the excl@@ usion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still hard
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if one has chosen the k@@ ader that England sees for the tour , see a rep@@ et@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series in my map .
I would not close a forward win .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks Page is probably less experienced than those 3 years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing position ; and the community spirit is strong ; they are no scar from 2012 , only a young infin@@ ite setting .
with the ball developed Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
this message is by Adam LY@@ th from the UK @-@ Test @-@ loader and will be replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to resol@@ ve Adam LY@@ th , is of course to analy@@ ze me as his head of head in Yor@@ k@@ shire , who is hard to analy@@ ze it .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ es players are looked for at results .
there was no quest@@ ionn@@ aire at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said that - players are their own best cho@@ ices .
long time ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had the control of his own dest@@ iny .
if he hop@@ efully upgraded further days for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss sh@@ ined his attitude , even though he had not restored good benefits , and that sur@@ prised me ; he is primarily a team man .
the question of how much time is a test b@@ ats@@ man receives to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven Ch@@ ances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine received .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to do home and re@@ wards .
the only fore@@ throw that it may be heavy , Jonathan Tr@@ ott was taken at the Caribbean at first - when Ly@@ th was in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es come near , and he is a b@@ ats@@ man that I sets up high .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in early season , when he achieved a room at Tr@@ ent Bridge in 236 days .
he must have at least the same chan@@ ces such as those who are before it , but this is on course of course abroad in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , Mo@@ een to Cook suggest to bring an extra @-@ Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qu@@ icks would be di@@ visible , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ old has not strike there , and this left @-@ handed process has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may not run his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no difference .
in Lang@@ er , my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests when he appeared as an option in 2001 .
he has made three hundred sh@@ uns immediately , and did not fly back .
Zaf@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the f@@ ader as a Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limit@@ ated dealing with him , he im@@ pressed me as young man .
people may see his statistics on an average of 31 with the bat and 35 by the ball - and think , it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup spots that lift up their hands and the trainer have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England spent a few cl@@ ue additions to the practice .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ eness , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , served as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ piece .
he is one of the most peaceful guys of the game , which will bring an abund@@ ance of experiences since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes with the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the set @-@ up .
I always felt that he created for the international Cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela did he pro@@ spects for whom we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices in the dressing cabins can fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with the previously spoken .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and te@@ am@@ work will not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that , as in players dep@@ end their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made light in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of British accession to the EU ) might be able to supply if the economy came into a fleet in 2017 .

a European diplom@@ at , said again that several states , so de@@ eply sc@@ aled in different cr@@ ises such as the EU is now and not always out of own debt , the UK itself created with health@@ ier awar@@ eness and inter@@ ference contracts they are mostly filled .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not like to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .

my European friend , who wish to congrat@@ ulated in the inside of the EU &apos;s inside - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets say that more and more short @-@ time minister and civil servants have come to that point , on which there is no matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years before being bad@@ ly looking for them how they are ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated long apprenti@@ ces such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also an al@@ lied force .
in Poland , a nation@@ alist regime , Spain has an left to take a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will get off a leg to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be better to prevent their energy from the UK - something that they do not want to tend@@ encies in most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tend@@ encies .

but to fight , &quot; under all circumstances , &quot; he was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what happened in the JC of his co @-@ compet@@ itors and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touch Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to remember that he even has touched me - News Dis@@ cipl@@ ine remains in the age of TV about the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .

however , some researchers have set the power handling of the data and proved to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industries .
an edit@@ orial articles in the professional journal Lanc@@ et last month is the &quot; excep@@ tionally tiny foundation , &quot; which he established his major closing conclusion .
two more researchers have been question@@ ing in BM@@ J , and have asked whether the claims to build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin McK@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygi@@ ene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Ep@@ idem@@ i@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies are based on the proof of the effic@@ acy . &quot;
they said that the asser@@ tion is expected that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes about 95 % less harm@@ ful are based on a detailed review of demand and mod@@ eling .
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were invited to develop a model for a multi @-@ critical series decision @-@ makers ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinion about the damage from different Nik@@ ine @-@ rich products to a synth@@ esis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ized in a research report .
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a spon@@ sor of the meeting named Euro@@ Swiss Health was their managing director before British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BAT about the Public Health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting , funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes autom@@ aker , but not the funding that he received before reports previously covered by the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added it .
the reasons for the selection of members of the bodies are not supplied , but these are several popular E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champion , some of which also give a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
in the meeting also the tobacco line from P@@ he participated .
the research work of the group &quot; stands , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no one of these links or restri@@ ctions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there have no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking .
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of Health and W@@ are@@ well at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J has already responded .
he said , &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harm@@ ful than smoking . &quot;
each other li@@ fel@@ ong smoking dies in his search .
all evidence suggest that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes in comparison are small , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear oblig@@ ation to the information of the public over what the evidence is occupied and what does not , especially if it comes as much public conf@@ usion over the relative d@@ ang@@ ers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die from a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion a year .
through the clear advance of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fr@@ action of damage caused by which caused by the smoking , we meet our national j@@ uris@@ diction .
BBC should place East@@ En@@ ders , former head of Channel 4 ,
the former ch@@ air@@ woman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop to stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that the commercial Riv@@ als &quot; would give her right arms &quot; for Hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to do the type of programs which are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ized the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audi@@ ences , in hard contro@@ versi@@ al time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ val and from Sen@@ dern as B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that he wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson told him that he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 , with the BBC in touch .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are offered or sen@@ ds that BBC programs would be shown clearly by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed Riv@@ als , &quot; Johnson told the Ober@@ haus Comm@@ unic@@ ations Committee in the framework of his investigation into the BBC &apos;s future .
if you want to keep the radio fee , I don &apos;t want it or long term for a good idea , you should not make his production at least on programs that do not make others or order .
you send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a wide support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a jo@@ ke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programs that could be fin@@ anced without sub@@ si@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , assigned both own products .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give her right arm for it .
I have been trying to see how this publicly @-@ right TV is said .
I don &apos;t think that this is the BBC at all .
Johnson , a busin@@ ess@@ man for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC school has been working on the hunt for ratings they work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC will return to what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ di@@ am @-@ lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 shows that the BBC shows were to sell as East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal logical programs &quot; should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , where one should not measure the audience , and they cannot compre@@ h@@ end their tasks , and they cannot compre@@ h@@ ended with their se@@ em@@ ic missions for just@@ ification of 4 billion a round trip , &quot; Well , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ents programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they set them in a window , in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
on the radio charge , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can obtain the best value .
of course , you think all of us think it will have a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who vote for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they consume not much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 b@@ oss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC had to exam@@ ine their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to inform you and maintain . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC Production would have now been classified as a education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % in the radio stations - and it should have an example in the publicly @-@ law@@ ful television stations in Australia and Canada , for example , to ex@@ pose and maintain it . &quot;
to the question of the partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful in television are shown , and with the comm@@ erci@@ ally transm@@ itters are entering all online .
&apos;@@ Pro@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can cause brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ die can change the direction in the moment , in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .

the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ den change the direction in the moment , in which it with sound pulse , which have to be heard by means for the human hearing at high frequencies which are to be aired .
impul@@ ses are using mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells that are changed gen@@ et@@ ically to carry the membrane channels that re@@ act on ultr@@ as@@ ound waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers suggested that the wor@@ ms showed power of a new procedure , called son@@ ogen@@ etics , used in ultr@@ as@@ ound , to activ@@ ate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , resear@@ cher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedures of a day the deep brain stim@@ ulation could replace , an inv@@ as@@ ives process that provides electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people for the treatment of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ di@@ mer does not respon@@ d to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani determined that they did so when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the b@@ lowing , he found out to amplif@@ y the ultr@@ as@@ ound waves , which then enter into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ ound operations work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the mem@@ bran@@ es of some of the saus@@ ages .
the sound waves are the opening of these ic@@ onic channels and activ@@ ating the cells of which they are assigned , as a report of nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ as@@ ound controlled trials , Chal@@ as@@ ani gen@@ et@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ one@@ ur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels are carrying .
if it is ultr@@ as@@ ound on the variable cre@@ atures , sound waves are strengthened through micro@@ bl@@ ues and put into wor@@ ms , where they switch the mot@@ ifs .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scientists given ne@@ ur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light and off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ esis could have some advantages compared to this technology .
in contrast to light , that must be sent to the right in the brain in the brain , it can pass low @-@ frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound tissue samples and can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that with gender and a therapeutic virus , the targeted human ne@@ ur@@ ons are tempor@@ arily challeng@@ ed for the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells .

eight gold @-@ min@@ ds for life in student dormitories
eleven years ago , I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old at a student residence , still in faith to Ber@@ ets and mor@@ al re@@ visions , but only now remin@@ is@@ cent of the smile of those who have off@@ ended me - and at the numerous , long @-@ term compl@@ aints about other .
most of what I learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the moving in student halls dates from a slight time stri@@ pping up to absolute sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s ver@@ up@@ ted too slow : people tell wh@@ ence you come from whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year year , where you are talking to Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in the Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha that I am in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out what you like to find yourself in contrast to those where you don &apos;t want to talk , even if your eyelashes in the oven , and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be found .
let men let men .
the room of people are often walking in be@@ verage recipes , film events venues and municipal outdoor events , but they are also the places where people are going to dress up and their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start the university with a relation
in@@ dri@@ p received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but a lot of student dormitories form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ w@@ umm@@ el culture , which is kind and soci@@ ally and to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to re@@ cover himself .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want to pass on our friendship , but you must go away the energy , which I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comm@@ il@@ it@@ n@@ ity of soci@@ al@@ izing is exhau@@ sted - and send him a message instead .
A@@ prop@@ os ank@@ lo@@ ons : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship excl@@ ude by Baking .
since you begin the university on the cli@@ max of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the clo@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have always smile . so , and now please smile , if I have a couple of personal questions . &quot;
homemade lo@@ wer@@ ies , we offer a good way to close friends .
their gar@@ n@@ atives feel themselves ob@@ li@@ ged to join themselves and will be associ@@ ate your face with a good surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an aw@@ ful bakery .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed r@@ ump made of flour , sugar and fat do that people sleep sleeping if you ank@@ ed .
food to ste@@ al , is a common crime in student dormitories .
of course , the cl@@ aws Of ch@@ ick@@ ens is a th@@ ief , but is it the rest of a drop in Mil@@ d for your tea ?
check that with the owner &apos;s milk .
the chan@@ ces are good that they say they themselves to use himself , even if they are in the interior .
if any man ste@@ als ste@@ als , and you have my con@@ sens@@ ation , but try to t@@ ack@@ le care , and try to t@@ ack@@ le them than my co @-@ hab@@ itation , that added to her milk , to pen@@ al@@ ties to th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they shou@@ ldn &apos;t make noise , the people from sleep , or from the work .
it &apos;s not just to be an aw@@ ful man , but that you are in the true sense of the s@@ ay@@ ings of people that are sitting in the glass .
a girl on my hall asked her neigh@@ bo@@ urs , whether it makes them something light , Drum &amp; Bass turned something light , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an ex@@ am in the morning .
they re@@ act with still loud music .
when they were finally arrested at 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neigh@@ b@@ ors still sleeping two hours before they left their own music , shut down their door shut down at their three hour test .
would it be not romantic if your future man@@ ages would go into the same student residence ?
the way it would not be ab@@ sur@@ prising because if you want to take a hab@@ itable for your future married couples that take part in them , and should see them every day , and perhaps , as they all goes to them all of their friends ?
of course , the heart is its own way - but if a hot shared bathroom is definitely not your future married couple , try to speak a little bit of mind .
at the very exciting moment , in which you noticed that a person left his keys in its not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ bb@@ ing f@@ one appears as it seems .
a good tri@@ ck is funny , but it takes only mom@@ ents until he became the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson above safety - but never fail@@ ing any room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which then put in the freezer , but t@@ ack@@ ers their owners at the blank@@ et no more than twice .
terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , single @-@ par@@ ent , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ener
the property contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds a real terrac@@ ed terrac@@ ed terrac@@ ed houses for people who did not have plenty of money .
so , for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need for camp@@ ers , but also the young mother and the sm@@ ell thereof . &quot;
&quot; I think , just as you can still build and build it today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are dr@@ unk in the building market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how fast @-@ out living room can be created : it builds in a project terrac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are dr@@ unk on the property market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass@@ acres of people in containers or gym has no sustainability .
because men remain in a great part here .
in view of the refugee camp , we also need sufficient living room for the next decade .
a very ban@@ ales , three @-@ storey terrac@@ ed house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs a maximum square .
it makes it easy to integ@@ rate .
that is different when people are en@@ rolled in a home blocks .
each of the six houses , which are built in the pilot project , consists of three apartments for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees shall say , it &apos;s peace , and I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square metres of space per house is valu@@ ed at 184 000 euros , excluding property .
this is p@@ age@@ able .
the construction takes six months .
that is fair .
have the building instructions comp@@ lic@@ ated their plans ?
g@@ ild@@ ner : I moved to correctly my project correctly .
particularly comp@@ lic@@ ated , it is always the threat@@ ening qu@@ o@@ cl@@ ens ( special construction and parking lot ) .
gr@@ illed .
it is still subject to having three apartments in a town@@ house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities are missing in this place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants respon@@ d to her home @-@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there was those who have been accused of having to create luxury yach@@ ts for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not true .
but don &apos;t miss the compet@@ itors get paid housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true Is Now : we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but built luxury apartments that can hardly be able to aff@@ ord themselves .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the young mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ .
I think , just as you can still build and build it well today .
that &apos;s why it is .

iOS 9 : how to Get the New iPhone operating system when Apple released an update
the new operating system can be requested by using the setting app for &quot; General &quot; ti@@ ffs and then &quot; Software update . &quot;
if ready is ready , you can download the phone option to download and install Inst@@ alling .
some are punc@@ tu@@ ally after installation , since they received an error message inform@@ ing that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to convert your problem , it is recommended to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update the iTunes .
the telephone itself leads through the rest of the trial .
this may possibly make the del@@ eting of Apps . but Apple has made it easier to do this , but it will be easier to do so if you install a special tool to install apps , and then re @-@ install to the process as soon as the process is finished .
it is worth it to ensure that your cell phone is up@@ loaded during the up@@ dating or is close to a char@@ gers , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple cannot be continued that the update will continue , as the phone may this way up to half way and this could lead to a break@@ down of updates .

it was symp@@ ath@@ y at first sight , when the rock standing before years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll truly learned to complete their specialized formation in the hospital , and the year also wants to enter the practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mül@@ ans would fit into this practice &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and la@@ cht .
&quot; when it was done , I just call it . &quot;
the married couple Müller was the idea to emplo@@ y his own practice in As@@ endorf .

after the conversion the rooms of modern appearance will look like modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ time and stress . we need to offer a microphone room more .

a total of 50000 Euro sur@@ passes the Mül@@ ans in the context of a funding program from the district ( 25,000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; it shows how proud and be glad we are impro@@ ving the practice , &quot; st@@ resses Sam@@ y@@ self @-@ Mayor of Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2000 patients are given according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter into practice , in the north German average practice there are about 500 patients .

a positive ad@@ visory effect of the pre@@ domin@@ ance by Frank Müller : the Phar@@ m@@ acy remains located according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no fol@@ lo@@ wers had been found , she would have gone .
if you have visited the gar@@ bage &apos;s voice , the guide also continues to ent@@ ru@@ sted all faces : over the seven medical professionals and the cle@@ ans@@ ing force of the rock .
with its f@@ are@@ well , there was a era in As@@ a , after all the medical prof@@ esses were pract@@ ised for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen does not remember .
it sm@@ ote a little her@@ m@@ wood after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hoh@@ en@@ mo@@ or and many patients still often see , &quot; the intervals are often .
her husband compl@@ ements l@@ ach@@ ingly : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now , Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner , &quot; said the border controls even at our south border . &quot;
inspec@@ tions on the Hungarian border remains in parallel .
just as it is clear that everyone who wants to ask an application for asylum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear that it takes distinct signals , &quot; said the Minister .
the humans must know that we do not accept the limit@@ less mig@@ rat@@ ous flows - not above the Austro @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is defeated &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia .
in before , the Croatian Government had previously agreed that Slovenia would leave refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , under circumstances , cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
all this happened the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Ljubljana .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be taking the monitoring of the fron@@ tier - mainly to Hungary - inten@@ sively .
as far as the border of the Sch@@ engen area , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled .
as the Minister of Minist@@ ers , Sloven@@ ian , wants to reach its limit@@ ations for refugees , but never des@@ k@@ ite .
&quot; every EU member must ref@@ ill its oblig@@ ations , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; st@@ ressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
like the Croatian Government , the first refugees had attemp@@ ted to drive the night hours to Tuesday in Eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / SI@@ D to depart out of registration .
the Croatian police allowed them to attack corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continuously meet police cars with new refugees .
it mainly rel@@ ate around Sy@@ rer , Afghanistan , among them numerous women and children .
they also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country was approximately 4,000 refugees , the Minister of Interior of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses made from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Maz@@ ed@@ onian Soviet border , who had previously transferred to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported the Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade are however , however , that it would be wise to excl@@ ude mankind , certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want this to do it , &quot; it was called .
according to the media reports , at the morning there will be a first bus with approximately 50 refugees near the Serbian border town SI@@ D , in the course of the day , additional buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were driving the entire night of approximately 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has said , so the police have told us that we go to here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
this might be actually fore@@ seen from ob@@ servers already previous Balk@@ an Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to come to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for limit control &quot;
in Croatia , Minister of Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , the Minister of Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had previously prepared that his country prepared for the case of a strong hold of refugees according to possible ex@@ cer@@ ations .
he also called his name , but he pointed out that Croatia has been a non @-@ Sch@@ engen member &quot; comprehensive opportunities to limit control . &quot;
considering the strict control of controls to qualif@@ y for membership in the sc@@ or@@ space .
Slovenia has been part of the country since 2007 and has since been a good report on the country since it has been a good report regarding the standard of the bound@@ aries .
on the Hungarian border , there are still about 300 refugees near the Hungarian border au@@ n .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os , who heads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border check@@ points H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i bre@@ g remains fully locked .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue through the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Minister Ne@@ bo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic attemp@@ ted to work on Wednesday at a local head in H@@ org@@ os : he ret@@ ained the deb@@ ates on altern@@ atives of refugees after the Hungarian border has closed .
there would not be at present very high refugees .
could not say if they continue their journey about Hungary , Croatia or another country .
help of mig@@ rants attemp@@ ts to haz@@ ard@@ ous - altern@@ atives
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distri@@ bute the refugees forced to distri@@ bute an alternative routes through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not a haz@@ ard@@ ous : in parts of the border , there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mines were sent in the border region .

Fed@@ Ex result mixed , personal out@@ look for 2016 lowered
Fed@@ Ex reported dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant rec@@ alls its winning demand for a complete year due to freight services and higher costs in its ground floor sports .
the company also said that she is planning to pay approximately 55@@ .000 se@@ asonal workers for their vacation .
at this date , Fed@@ Ex is announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 se@@ asonal workers for vacation time .
the stock fell by 2.5 per cent at the market @-@ market 45 minutes before the opening ceremony on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. saying a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and 10,90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cents less than at the previous forecast .
an@@ alyst@@ s anticip@@ ated according to a survey of fac@@ t@@ Kit 10,@@ 84 $ .
the smaller view comes despite the price increases , aver@@ aged 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , despite the higher supplements for ground transport of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that it remained non@@ eth@@ eless the result compared to the previous year due to cost cutting , higher income , and because of growth in online trading will increase .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings a solid income , especially in terms of anticip@@ ated economic conditions , especially in production and global trade , considering that . &quot;
plans for holidays in holidays have been announced a day later when the ri@@ val power announced that 90@@ .000 to 95@@ .000 additional working forces is planning to stop as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 692 million was deployed , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at € 2.@@ 42 per share , just under the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked an@@ alyst@@ s predic@@ ts .

in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has set a decline to the international priority ship@@ ment for the last years , to stag@@ n@@ ating sales in his unit Express Shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results to Fed@@ Ex ground .
the final quarter sales increased by 29 per cent in the final quarter , but the operating result was in bas@@ ically flat because of higher costs for larger packages , and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher income for higher prices , while the result due to higher labour costs decreased .
the pre@@ market trading , about one hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares at 3,85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0.15 $ .

at their most anticip@@ ated meeting in the years spend Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists two days this week round about a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table , to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade following the conductivity .
threatened by the end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey seating center is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Ch@@ air@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues will set the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ time order from the Congress : maxim@@ ization of U.S. Emp@@ loyment and Prices are st@@ ably stable .
but since the great rec@@ ession have acknowle@@ dged the F@@ ed Guide , that it is a valid third mand@@ ate : financial stability .
and this third man could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to be predic@@ ting . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the near the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it could be solid , the most recent out@@ look at the global financial markets would already increase these vol@@ at@@ ility as a result of the tick in the German financial markets - and it is only one @-@ quarters one percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labor market and inflation in first line is the most important thing which they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Ch@@ ef@@ elder in the Ma@@ kl@@ er@@ ster Foundation Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if you were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased un@@ certain@@ ty around the global market is enough just@@ ification , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed will do , which guarantees the financial markets .
approximately half of the econom@@ ists who have been question@@ ed recently by Bloom@@ berg , have forec@@ asted a rate of interest this week .
however , the financial markets are a@@ waiting a F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to enh@@ ance an increase .
this imp@@ lies on a decline in stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists move off the impact , they promise that a further increase is far away .
at Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Me@@ an increased its average rating of 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was trig@@ gered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy has provided a set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ op@@ om at Moody &apos;s Capital Mark@@ ets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the phr@@ ases at that time , &quot; he said .
if you &apos;re doing it , it would have to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets , so that they do not get into pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts ar@@ gu@@ ed that a second increase was qui@@ et@@ ened the financial markets that it would take un@@ certain@@ ty when the F@@ ed will take to elim@@ inate .
before a month , the F@@ ed would have a good way to increase the set by 0,25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow pro@@ cl@@ am@@ ation of mon@@ et@@ ical conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in the early summer , in spite of the compl@@ aints declared that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the pro@@ position .
although the creation of jobs in August demanded s@@ lower , the improvement in the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent in the past month , the lowest for more than seven years and in the vicinity of the level , the F@@ ed looks as full @-@ employment .
wage gains have shown signs of a recovery .
and although the inflation stead@@ ily expired under the annual target of 2 % of Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative , said the main reason for the temporary effect of low oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ dit@@ om at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ a .
but the financial markets around the world will be combined in the end of the last month after China had given its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Me@@ an fell to more than 16 % below its peak , as investors were fe@@ ared that a slow@@ down on Chinese economy would increase global growth of D@@ ros@@ aries .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , but the D@@ ow now is by nearly 10 % below the level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market tur@@ bul@@ ences influ@@ ences the complex calculation of lim@@ estone where to increase the interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weak@@ ness of Chinese economy would not have appeared in this meeting , said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of U.S. banknotes .
now he claims that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty in excess of its impact on the US economy , and there &apos;s almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said .
the health of the world economy is none of the capital in@@ lay , therefore it should not be involved in their decision @-@ making .
but in the en@@ de@@ er , the F@@ ed monetary authorities have become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous throughout the last years .
the mere not@@ ion of the former Leit@@ ers Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed is able to handle their external Expansion , &quot; ext@@ ingu@@ ishes around the globe .
in a world , markets and econom@@ ies increasingly des@@ ir@@ able , the F@@ ed representative are expected to monitor from the F@@ ed representative , but also with other central banks and experts adv@@ ise to achieve a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary car@@ ab@@ car@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , observed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ sight on the financial market movements which are linked with appar@@ ently with the economic foundations . &quot;
L@@ acker , authorized member of the Federal Open Market Committee , foc@@ uses on a capital increase in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their lead rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite the limit@@ less consequences of growth in the US &quot; said L@@ acker .
one year later , the F@@ ed representative of these ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations moved back .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in just a severe crisis as the market crash in 2008 , Adam S. Poznan was former member of the Committee on the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ bul@@ ences are not coming near this level , he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t want to remember the situation , in which they fe@@ ared in front of a refuge , because the markets came up with rain , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act contains still the double mand@@ ate and men@@ tions not the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should keep the time .

Brazil @-@ Pap@@ ti@@ at@@ ric Association Rio Grande promot@@ es diet for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
the Brazilian @-@ pap@@ al organization inj@@ ectors trying to clar@@ ify how important health during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding point is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that painted on bre@@ asts that painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , to give all the nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mot@@ hers , their daily cal@@ orie intake increases about 500 calories per day .
however , the new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation , the mot@@ hers should take .
a current survey conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women affects the genes of their babies and protects against the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child may have impact the immune system .
excep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ ays Sports Hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the construction entry for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited mem@@ orial at the Bern@@ stor@@ ing sport grounds come in step forward : in the most recent Municipal meeting , the planned facility was approved without great discussions .
previously , the panel has had an application for an ent@@ ally called &quot; respect for &quot; respect &quot; for the valid B@@ eb@@ au@@ plan .
in the &quot; exception &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof of the roof .
therefore , a &quot; semi @-@ roof , with non @-@ key first and roof@@ top &quot; will be erected .
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; thus we get a wonderful big South @-@ roof , &quot; declared may@@ or Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
at the Liberation , it went again to climb the lo@@ ft that is written for energ@@ etic reasons - differ@@ ently than in the development plan - below 10 degrees .
in this way , the volume of the hall will be reduced significantly .
a &quot; Liberation &quot; is therefore necessary because the building plan would not allow &quot; excep@@ tions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ays of the municipal applications rather restri@@ ct the way for the Liberation of Liberation .
however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a prec@@ ed@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the sports centre in the sports centre is a community project , and SV Bern@@ ried .
at the cost of approximately 2.3 million euros .
the spon@@ s@@ ors are expected from the scho@@ ol@@ - and width spon@@ sor@@ ship .
in the next step , the Bau@@ an@@ trag for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be presented with the program for testing .

refugees need accommodation : study warning for housing
the location on the German residential market is un@@ sharpen@@ ed .
even more refugees seek a paid lead .
the pressure on the residential market is growing .
the social activ@@ ates is on a challenge .
the participating events on the German residential market have begun .
more people with the an@@ alyst@@ s and working su@@ peri@@ ors from the EU has always been over@@ loaded on a market that is now over@@ loaded in many metro@@ politan .
you con@@ tours with income @-@ weak citizens around the last paid apartments .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , up to approximately 400,000 new units have to be built .
in this result , a study commissioned by the commission of the &quot; Social Ac@@ commod@@ ation &quot; Committee . &quot;
by comparison , a total of 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany .
this seem to be 140@@ .000 apartments .
refugees are no more ob@@ li@@ ged after the first three months of their stay to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a home stay .
many will then put on the rental market and series marks in the long windows in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Office of Statist@@ ics , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were rent in the last year .
but the negative development of the residential house is not only to be rising to the rising number .
the study also makes considerable re@@ distri@@ cts in the housing policy of the last years .
Germany follows a housing def@@ ensive one , which is greater than the year earlier .
currently , Matthias Günther , author of the study are lack@@ ing in the metro@@ politan areas in the metro@@ politan areas .
many voc@@ alist people therefore stayed in large enterprises listed in tr@@ ams rooms .
young adults remained on the building market for volun@@ tar@@ ily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in large cities , the number of square meters per capita has decreased in the last years .
in order to solve this problem , the Alliance of social construction &quot; suggest@@ s a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ons are to sp@@ ur the social construction work again .
thus , the real estate tax may be om@@ itted , and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed homes should be suspended .
according to B@@ ünd@@ nis attractive tax @-@ application possibilities , are necessary .
the delivery program for refugee within the State Bank of Kf@@ W , comes already well in cities and municip@@ alities already .
a good week after the start was up to 184 million euros on the Monday evening , more than half of the available amounts to around 300 million euros .
now , the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia compl@@ ish cor@@ ridor
to Hungary , practi@@ cally no more could go through , since more refugees can select the way over Croatia .
Zagreb does not att@@ ending the journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route does not end@@ anger .
Croatia aims to deal with the neighbour@@ ing land of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister and when it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Sch@@ engen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Sch@@ engen country yet .
after the de@@ position of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds refugees forced into Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , report the Croatian television channel RTL .
Hung@@ arians had sealed its border for refugees at the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , transl@@ ates to transl@@ ate asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia plans to pass the refugees .
Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this way . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve a little bit .
however , people still wanted to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police arrested its first refugees on the border of Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbour@@ ing countries in Croatia .
most of the media reports were reported to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they were both with the bus and also with Tax@@ es to the Serbian border city SI@@ D .
immediately after her arrival , they had tried to get walking via the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees do not flee to Gren@@ f@@ ences .
hi@@ ther@@ to the bound@@ aries of the border : there are still sharp mines in the Yugosl@@ av@@ ian civil war in the 1990s .
mine sco@@ ot@@ ers should now make a safe passage now .
according to Hungary , the closure of the border has hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday the police gathered an un@@ t@@ apped people .
shortly before the deadline , it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws amplif@@ iers the conqu@@ ering and damage to the Gren@@ ade us as a criminal off@@ ense .
a criminal proceedings started in the south @-@ Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed as a criminal proceedings .
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten up to five years and dep@@ ortation of the country .
according to the immig@@ ration , one went on Tuesday to the new to the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ons &quot; in total 94 asylum applications , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applic@@ ants , 13 families with young children , as well as two older people .
on Wednesday afternoon there were still 40 refugees .
yet , no one has received a view to have granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian &apos;s side , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the challeng@@ ed asylum seek@@ ers are to be cham@@ fer@@ ed there .
before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were met .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke started workers to grow up workers .
they raised the Mül@@ l , which caused tens of thousands of people in the last weeks by the road@@ side .
re@@ gr@@ ille were re@@ constructed and rebuilt one of the recording business in the bound@@ ary site .
for the goal of this re@@ generating , nobody was wanted to extern@@ ally .
after closing the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , there are only a few refugees .
in addition , the country has strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 mig@@ rants were still in the country however still in the country .
in Salzburg , around 1400 people wait for the trip to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the German authorities on the German authorities .
the group met regularly smaller groups of refugees .
may@@ or drove &quot; Gest@@ uring &quot; about the border
&quot; we were occupied by the bridge on Sunday with the win@@ der , when suddenly ten people with@@ drew a travel edge at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so the may@@ or of Alois Stad@@ ler .

because Germany was dis@@ continued on Sunday but because of the refugee &apos;s journey with Austria , it was ready for it in W@@ ern@@ stein , the Stad@@ ler , who immediately offer his aid and the str@@ anded along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we did not have their wa@@ it@@ ated guests at first time , with snack and be@@ verage .
we have been right , we spend it with the car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was of course , &quot; the Stad@@ ler interview in O@@ Ö@@ N . &quot;
they were very gr@@ ate@@ ful .
a man has not suffered a gener@@ ous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; this has very pleased , &quot; the Stad@@ ler .
the str@@ anded enco@@ res were increased on Sunday evening in Wels of an ICE train in a regional direction Pass@@ au , in order to publish its short notice after the short term , that the railway transport was dis@@ continued after Germany , but still passing through the border .
the regional train was set up before the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein is the border @-@ border broad@@ ly in the course .
the bridge firm@@ ly linked with the Bavarian neigh@@ bo@@ urs with the Bavarian neigh@@ bo@@ urs , a tan@@ dem running behind - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
as Viktor Or@@ b@@ án Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now em@@ bro@@ idered to us , is a logical conclusion of an evi@@ dent policy :
rather than in the stock of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , in order to help structures and human@@ ity , our German Chancellor hosted the position of Hungarian government in the ha@@ ze of national soci@@ alism .
this policy is not only those Au@@ stri@@ ans who are now con@@ fron@@ ted in the bound@@ ary areas with cha@@ otic circumstances .
the fe@@ ared work@@ outs are to be said that &quot; Gel@@ ob@@ te Land , &quot; which she is invited , and welcome to secret it , nothing else than another refugee camp .
there will be a major challenge , in view of persist@@ ent refugee camp and the nearby winter , we wanted to produce human being human being at human being .
and there will be one even larger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,000 win@@ ter@@ firm qu@@ arti@@ ce
Konrad has filled all hands to the refugee service in Konrad .
Christian Konrad is it usual that his word has weight .
the government has been used by the former powerful Raiffeisen Ban@@ ker to set Qu@@ arti@@ ere for thousands of refugees .
Konrad already has already received the ch@@ aos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen care centre , Konrad already has been in the handle .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success .
on Monday , the accommodation of 20,000 refugees , which came to Austria on Monday , is without great work , said Konrad and lo@@ bb@@ ing the organiz@@ ational &apos; master@@ piece . &quot;
the Interior said , &quot; however , &quot; failed by a &quot; kr@@ one &apos;s situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad employs a total of 85@@ ,000 qu@@ arti@@ s in this year .
in order to meet the number , 35,000 hotels will need to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are to provide 15,000 the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; he said Konrad .
with the state capit@@ als , he has already run con@@ vers@@ ations .
those could have been sent to him , even to create the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s good , &quot; Ferry Ma@@ ier said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
this morning there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , will be ex@@ plan@@ ted as the church will help .
great expectations sets the asylum coordin@@ ator even in the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Help as we . &quot;
on the platform you can offer private individuals un@@ comp@@ lic@@ ated accommodations .
the hotel also h@@ opes to hotels that stand empty in the winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ized the standards for placing than &quot; very high . &quot;
in Not@@ ary , there could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ator must have a certain height of the gloves or size .
for a temporary time , &quot; not@@ ches are to be applied .
by contrast to the Ministry of the Interior at the lodging of successful , Konrad presents its experience with his experience .
I am an older Lord , who doesn &apos;t speak without his face to the face .
convic@@ tion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the republic , as they proclaimed itself .
their employees are to increase to three to four .
our own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ suche did not have been successful yet .
Konrad wanted a container on the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz @-@ office .

the h@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter in K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancest@@ ors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose hab@@ it@@ ants are called .
this feature is also connecting to the billi@@ on@@ aire that wants to become President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for re@@ members .
if he expressed himself a foreign citizen , journalists male , or knowledge about the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the US pre@@ sidency will bring the election campaign strongly .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Scott@@ ish d@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property milli@@ on@@ är@@ s had come .
many of the New York &apos;s cap@@ tion is a concept to the Win@@ ery at the Win@@ ery village .
some 1200 inhabitants is with him in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place and related to him .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here during the election mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del rot@@ ated a movie via Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers over his aim to become a powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that you &apos;ll find something like exciting , but they are not im@@ pressed in their defin@@ ite way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary on the site and his famous spr@@ ints , at which Tr@@ ump also counts the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for descrip@@ tive is , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t brought it to the king of the heart .
indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but ten@@ ds ten@@ ds that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit like a big au@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
it &apos;s not random from the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ y@@ es@@ macher is &quot; - too high : the rel@@ ber , says it .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of employees .
the tr@@ ump &apos; success story began in 1885 when the future grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold @-@ gr@@ ab@@ ber in the USA .
the foundation stone of real estate Group were first property sales in New York .
but life of grand@@ parents was not free from trag@@ ic@@ ism : their desire to return to home to the Bavarian state , to which the Pfalz was back at the time .
he has not included the ump of Tr@@ ump , because he was once approved without homologation , the director of the Institute for Social History and People &apos;s House , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ child of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this is contrast to the co @-@ listed statements of the desc@@ endants .
the repe@@ ating repeat@@ edly was spoken of Mexican immig@@ rants in the USA , and demanded the construction of a border wall to acc@@ ust@@ al illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as it is pol@@ ishing , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a dist@@ ant transformation Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; Die O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the O@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ akers of retirement sees the Americans to be more dist@@ anced , &quot; it is always so up@@ ted . &quot;
does he believe that tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; that can &apos;t even imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never has never been destroyed by K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension absorption in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentioned as mand@@ ated K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz Family said on a visit to something for the church organ that was generally well .
&quot; that can &apos;t hes@@ itate to introduce me from Donald , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
you will get it better if he won &apos;t catch the choice , because &quot; it is such a radi@@ cal belie@@ ving that I don &apos;t know whether this is good . &quot;
if those who had in the time of his grand@@ father in the USA had been , as he did , &quot; he would never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting them@@ es as it , &quot; says Win@@ ec@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .

&quot; my President is not so , &quot; says they .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who is going to choose ?
mystery in the secret ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have possibly ir@@ regular , who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree .
the woman who became a Bachelor in &apos;s Bachelor in Bachelor , has been covered in the largest confi@@ denti@@ ality .
and no one of the three remaining girls will certainly not be in@@ expensive , whether it is the one who received the Last Rose .
but when we had Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on day before they checked out of three two , you may obtain a h@@ int to be a note that he will be the winner .
Sam Wood maint@@ ains his lips to the Final of Thursday , sealed
all three women have left over it to L@@ yr@@ ische ways : why choose the perfect man and they proclaimed his sense of hum@@ or , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude than the reasons why they wanted to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should receive Wo@@ ods last Rose ? &quot; they could win their answers to the game who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ist .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except yourself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a good relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment , when I saw into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energi@@ es , I felt that they were pretty good , and I thought it all of the show , said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on the earth , with its feet on Earth , it makes a lot of fun with her &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the correct Chem@@ istry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believed that they and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house last week was clear that wood &quot; could be &quot; one &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family I was clear that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fixed on him , &quot; she said .
and when being asked to choose the wood , when they were not , they were terri@@ ble .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls ali@@ ke - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 PM on top .

&quot; it was a thing that comes first , you &apos;ll take care of just the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .

20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not clear why the used rubber blade , of which is known that they can kill themselves , but it is tradition@@ ally used as a less dead@@ ly alternative , obviously have produced a trem@@ end@@ ous cause .

for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abet@@ ics , weight loss can be benef@@ ic@@ ial .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say , whether slightly more exposed people with diabetes after weight loss surgery is longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , who wrote an edit@@ orial to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery .
weight loss @-@ loss operations or Adi@@ pos@@ itas Sur@@ gery , apply different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limits the body &apos;s own ability to record food .
over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgical procedures used to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that a person is over@@ weight , and people with a BMI above 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v
the researchers used the researchers from Tai@@ y@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of ob@@ es@@ ity surgery - stomach lining and gast@@ ric duct for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans that were slightly over@@ weight .
the average BMI below which under@@ went surgery , decreased from 31 to 24,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI among those who had non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments received approximately equal to 29 .
among those who sub@@ jected to surgical procedure , which resulted in 36 % of diabetes drug , and 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes accounted for only 20 percent in comparison with diabetes and partially only about two percent .
moreover , the results in controls of the blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &apos; group &quot; in general .
the researchers also super@@ vis@@ ors the patient &apos;s blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c that refle@@ cts the blood glucose levels during the period .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is the best for the aim of the resear@@ cher at 7 percent .
after surgery , the average Hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level sank by roughly 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you refle@@ cts in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - not lowered the mortality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also revealed average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , increased response in BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ comes of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the recent study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years , there are indic@@ ations of a study heav@@ ier people in Sweden that operation is leading to a longer life , Black@@ stone says von der University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was involved in ob@@ ese people who sub@@ jected to a ob@@ es@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less probably in the course of 15 years , compared to a group that was to cure conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage of survival in Sur@@ gery @-@ patients , Black@@ stone said , it is qui@@ et@@ ly interested in people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in proceedings .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because they say that this operation is in the lower BMI group lower , &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we have to wait for long until we bring people to take it , &quot; said it .
I think that once they accum@@ ulated this genetic changes that have linked their body with ob@@ es@@ ity and diabetes , it is really difficult . &quot;
love History , in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that is currently repeat@@ edly found in the fiction : a young woman , too popular and in@@ sigh@@ t@@ seeing , meets the ep@@ warm of their youth , and this tre@@ ad in them .
so even in the recently published novel , we are not so called &apos; by Luisa Binder .
the story of love story is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and its surrounding sett@@ l@@ ements .

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not record all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader called on to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the suffering from refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he ordered that , under the specified circumstances , the interests of the individual nations , or even continents should be collected .
he st@@ ressed that the reaction of Western European countries would be ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to enter Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
despite the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to struggle over the crisis , he st@@ ressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , like a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , created for these Muslim countries , &quot; st@@ ressed it .
ulti@@ mat@@ ely , we ulti@@ mat@@ ely have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; added he added .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and comm@@ ented also George Bus@@ hs to the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the USA went a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 11 September , I expressed my side @-@ cond@@ ol@@ ation in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; I know , his mot@@ ives were good , but he continued violence , and that caused in@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four @-@ fold increase from hand san@@ iti@@ zer by children over the past 4 years
ven@@ ge@@ al control centres in the USA report on an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , increasing so @-@ alcoholic hand san@@ iti@@ zer , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. G@@ ay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases reported by actions of hand san@@ iti@@ veness in children under 12 years , the Gif@@ tw@@ ist survey report from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are always more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the not@@ ary mark , &quot; Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants are deli@@ ber@@ ately drink , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or for a mut@@ ing at the social media .
Videos on YouTube shows how people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant only for one cheap children .
you@@ ths have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mou@@ th@@ wash , to get a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be le@@ ashed out of attractive d@@ ung@@ ers of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ berries , grapes and orange du@@ ft that are very promising for children .
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with small children , few inj@@ ectors can lead to det@@ ox@@ ification .

de Bo@@ er , at present an am@@ bassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic game more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Y@@ ang@@ ers are not there .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while they climb in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people un@@ employed to the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
according to the unemployment rate of 5.9 percent , above the value of the U@@ Ks were 5.5 per cent , as the numbers of the National Statist@@ ic for National Statist@@ ic ( ONS ) showed .

why I will be a witness to execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except for late legal intervention , I will be ash@@ amed as a man to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not be done in a vie@@ ury gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard g@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the Gif@@ tw@@ ine .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation already had its best friend for the first time in January and although I was sho@@ cked , I agree .
when the day appro@@ ached , I began to fear me .
so , why should I do it ?
I agree to , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists will be able to see journalists in the USA , and since often more applications are available , there will find a powerful lot@@ tery to decide to decide who is selected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected will be driven out emot@@ ional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be sitting next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p , my dear friend , whom I have developed my own relationship in the course of the months and a two @-@ half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh@@ s much , when we speak .
the prison authority say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to accept a notebook and one pen , to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember me all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of writing my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er , as he wants to , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained me with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had problem with some of the things I told and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t say what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants , that an international rep@@ orter will be present to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks to help the public relations of the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is situated next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go again to all details .
I cannot say that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is not guilty .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ vor should make him guilty , a benef@@ ici@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that a strong prob@@ ability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I think there is not enough evidence to just@@ ify an death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will die .
I cannot be asser@@ ted , really obj@@ ec@@ tively to be .
there will be other rep@@ orter who can be used for themselves .
what you will get from me , what it means to die a man to die another necessary death .
man after mo@@ ist the police , per@@ verse to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning Vale Women &apos;s cool dry place , when he was speaking to the man of the C@@ anning River .
one attempt of a man from Perth , who was dep@@ end to the police when he was found in the silk and sum@@ mar@@ ous water , just a few metres from a police officers , who tried to return it to the shore . &quot;
the German Police of C@@ anning Vale was launched on Tuesday to a building in Beck@@ enh@@ am on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , they tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he was not too far too far .
&quot; he stood in the water , saying &apos; I am not come out , come and hol &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Sh@@ ad@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Const@@ able l@@ ach@@ lan Per@@ h@@ av@@ ec was not too exc@@ ited about it , to make his unique gri@@ ds , so he turned a reliable tak@@ e@@ off - &apos; A good polic@@ eman is trad@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people &apos;s funny things to try to escape . &quot; he said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
champion @-@ team football player Ben Co@@ us@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , Co@@ us@@ ins participated in the tr@@ ench about to escape a alcohol control and then attemp@@ ted to sw@@ im on the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired the myst@@ eri@@ ous planning of a Ben Co@@ us@@ ins de Biathlon .
Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards tried to end him , and threat@@ ens to end the racing .
Peter Moody claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a Spy Knight in his st@@ ables and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he targeted at the ste@@ wards and the integr@@ ity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the Late Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a rac@@ ial day treatment , the last stro@@ kes on Wednesday .
Moody &apos;s Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do that which is best for the racing and himself in himself under difficult conditions as it went to the positive Kob@@ ari@@ i sample at L@@ id@@ aris because he cannot explain it .
he had returned 18 months because of the sp@@ oo@@ age group , and wanted to not see it , &quot; see how much of the grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say nothing about it , and I have long to eat , but sometimes they are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out on once , &quot; said Moody .
they know that it was far .
sometimes you re@@ acts , and I have to live with the consequences , and I have to live therefore what I said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I would like to go about it , and I would like to think my owner , that I try to try my best for them .
if they start to think , I do not do , then I should be no more coach .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
in prior Moody &apos;s Moody &apos;s bom@@ b shi@@ fts in an interview with rac@@ ers that the integr@@ ity Department tried to im@@ pose its st@@ all .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart did in a room with a man - whom I will be asked and sent him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com .
they believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should be surely l@@ ur@@ ged into their n@@ oses , because they have attemp@@ ting to f@@ ect me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of Route L , David Mo@@ ody , president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of the time today , and are still present today .
should you bring me to the view that it is personally ?
when Route L celebrates m@@ ill and perhaps there are people outside of the website , which is going on in the branch ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think , knowing that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and cast me away , and I do not doubt that I say what I say they are thinking about it .
but I arrived at the point , on which the matter is no matter , and that makes me gri@@ eved .
this makes me really mo@@ urn@@ ing .
I will try out the pressure to them and start it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the practice have set up with the long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt study at L@@ id@@ ari , and the late Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could choose &quot; his license above the table . &quot;
Moody , best known for its preparation of the un@@ regul@@ ated Mei@@ sters Black , awarded the race @-@ day treatment courses &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay , which was applied against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I have to assume the full responsibility &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators have ir@@ resist@@ ed ir@@ ish sl@@ ud@@ ge onto the leg .
it could have been so evening .
it could have been such a day all day , what it was so .
it was also like the racing day .
Moody &apos;s con@@ fron@@ ted for the treatment with a pack on the race Day . a recent example was opened for the treatment with a pack on the race Day .
it is a jo@@ ke .
people who apply these rules , don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one went to far , &quot; said Moody .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ ini suggest@@ s ri@@ val for ri@@ val back to Ring@@ ing
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy gave a critic@@ ism of the tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League fav@@ or@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told that the bit@@ ration boards will fight the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ ier &quot; with his team during the high Storm Sie@@ gs in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett had made a hard note to the Storm Team after his crew had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land do not be too well &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they only be concentr@@ ating on its &quot; contact &quot; in the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy spread out that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading coach on his team seemed to conf@@ id@@ ent that they were wor@@ ried that they were wor@@ ried from the Storm Team .
&quot; that came up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson over Ring@@ ier spoke , when she be@@ aten us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our faul@@ ty system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real emph@@ asis , and this has produced for us the trend @-@ turn .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he had appar@@ ently train a great team . he probably is probably not willing to lose , it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already funny , as it appears again for this season .
Bell@@ amy hasn &apos;t attacked the idea of the &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or still remember that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra gave the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long @-@ life &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that year 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a bor@@ ing team and Wayne said that he should take care of a bill of di@@ vor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play , and that we are as exciting , in particular its young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game that you like to play , if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so that they can play as they play .
I have strengthened his confidence , because they are saying these things because they are a bit wor@@ ried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it went around the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters recorded a higher result than the game Bron@@ co to Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t wat@@ ched it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attemp@@ ts in our game , but it is an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses make and no points any tension ?
it is the c@@ ams for me .
if you mention these things , it means that we are still meeting in a stage .
the Storm team has freely given at this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will begin tomorrow .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 deposit for Dro@@ gen@@ an@@ kl@@ age
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong penalty is threat@@ ening to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that have been lubric@@ ated to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police arrested 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , placed by South America over V@@ anu@@ atu and laid in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic was observed , as he attended his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police took 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly li@@ able sentence for attemp@@ ting to own a commercial amount of Kok@@ ain , ar@@ gu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic that there is no evidence that he was trying to poss@@ ess the whole lot , and that in the café , from a harm@@ less reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Fl@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the je@@ well@@ ery in Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic .
he has clear relation@@ ships to Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
at the fir@@ mary , he re@@ lied the police on his stay .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ik &apos;s mother and his father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 as security together in order to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the intended ex@@ plan@@ ations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 Dollar represents an effective financial burden , &quot; said Jud@@ el flanges .
but that only will not be sufficient to re@@ tain it , war@@ ned of it .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic was released on security , under the conditions that he en@@ de@@ ed his Australian and Ser@@ b Pass , by the police daily and keep on an initial block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

this decision was decided to print the Federal Constitutional Court in an on Wednesday .
the people can even have to wait for money , if they were imprisoned only a few days in the area ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
this was a ex @-@ in@@ mate to his Constitutional disp@@ utes in Karlsruhe : he was ho@@ used in the pyramid of the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel in June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was not separated .
after that , the man , who has now been moved to an open cell according to its conc@@ ub@@ es , has been moved to a large cell .
his ind@@ em@@ n@@ ity man@@ ages due to un@@ ad@@ able conditions against the land Berlin .
yet the Constitutional Court resol@@ ved the verdict of the K@@ amm@@ erg@@ erich in Berlin and proved the case to ren@@ ew the testing .
you will hear the man &apos;s human dig@@ nation .
K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ cht now determin@@ es the amount of compensation

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we do the &quot;
the migration of refugees is a trem@@ end@@ ous challenge - the Federal Chanc@@ ellery is decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Finance , around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers , according to the forecast of the German Federal Ministry , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany , is even able to take a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of un@@ anim@@ ations : &quot; I say again and again : we can make it , and we do it . &quot;
what is coming to Germany , the following overview :
according to a different forecasts there are between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the pest@@ le Institute ) units a year - throughout the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as so far ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of beds is a lack of living room but above all with paid @-@ sites : 60000 to 800@@ 00 national apartments from the rental price , and in order to apply these very favour@@ able apartments .
Federal Minister of the Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , which aims to double from 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the view of the pest@@ le Institute : 80 000 social fl@@ ats per year would have to rise and therefore need to invest 6.4 billion euros per year to the federal government .
in addition , scientists and Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs , there are also more control shares for investments in the housing construction .
according to estimates of the Institute for Labour market and professional research , 55 percent of the fe@@ ared in Germany can be employed .
however , refugees in Germany would not be system@@ atically being system@@ atically charged according to their qualification , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , however , it is cru@@ cial whether they are working in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation in the admission application , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ ence of immig@@ rants , says mig@@ rant @-@ resear@@ cher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turning : from the labour offered for refugees to the recognition of labour .
during early a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers , for up to five years , this was reduced to three months , as well as the re@@ sid@@ ences which run the asylum seek@@ ers to a residential site .
in the company itself - also due to the specialist of c@@ rows - several of the visual acu@@ ation that refugees can become even faster with access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of language skills .
so far , there is no discussion on general and based language courses .
research shows that jobs will be communic@@ ated most often by personal contacts .
this is why the establishment of network works is therefore into account of the Thr@@ iller of the König@@ s@@ weg for labor integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few Jewish parents were able to teach her children in the Kit@@ as , estimated to say 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the roots of their parents , &quot; say Il@@ ja Kos@@ chemical , spokes@@ man for Youth and Family in Berlin Senate administration .
nevertheless , in order to con@@ vin@@ ce the family &apos;s benefits , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need is going to take @-@ in through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would aim to increase training capacities - for example , to enh@@ ance more professionals .
in the countries , pupils are prepared without German @-@ language skills in welcome categories .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ olen from the Berlin school administration .
it is estimated that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
prin@@ cip@@ ally prohib@@ ited no federal government , or commem@@ or@@ ating the study - the only exception was in Berlin , the Interior of Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its st@@ ance now .
students may have to ease access to the university .
for refugees with a re@@ sidency or dep@@ loyment of no performance according to the asylum seek@@ ers Law , if they begin a study .
the latter is generally not a b@@ af@@ ar , since it does not fall under the circuit of b@@ af@@ ill .
in order to have had been living in Germany for four years to be entitled to be entitled &quot; by B@@ af@@ ö@@ g &quot; from 1 January 2016 , these span can be short@@ ened to 15 months .
but this tax gap must also be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Hall .
the students should now get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play an important role in future role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion became an important part of their identity .
the state should respect the same rights , as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state churches in the state to develop a new state @-@ religi@@ ons relationship .
it would also be important to the establishment of an Islamic welfare state , which takes care of the more ank@@ ers .
there are also duties to the right hand .
in this way , the representative of Islam have to be on clear contact for some and ready to work together with the state in many areas and some areas of control possibilities .
it also belongs to the read@@ iness to be accommod@@ ated against religious fundament@@ alism .
Ch@@ air@@ woman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , requ@@ ar@@ gu@@ ed the conc@@ ern on Thursday , religious conflic@@ ts might also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to make such conflict in Germany , &quot; &quot; have immediately just@@ ified their right to turn right , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio .
he proposed to transl@@ ate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will still be a lot more than today a subject of the whole society today .
in order to change the majority society , the dis@@ assembly of dis@@ cri@@ mination and rac@@ ism is due .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a cr@@ un@@ chy decade , an anti @-@ dis@@ cri@@ mination and a general ordin@@ ation Act .
yet it learned very slowly , as the NSU @-@ folders showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ial motif system@@ atically ig@@ no@@ red system@@ atically .
same chan@@ ces for all : what mig@@ rants organisations and those interested groups are compulsory for long time and people must be fru@@ ition in the next years , if the country will remain peaceful and their new citizens should benefit from their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany im@@ pr@@ ono@@ unced the un@@ expected refugees to supply re@@ medi@@ cally care , the state @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; what MAN@@ - Power and capacities , &quot; we have the &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
however , you need to flow additional money into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ders , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requests for all appe@@ als in the registration of health@@ care types .
later , services could be discounted later with the German states .
and in the long term there is highly frag@@ ments , so many people with the limited edition of services that see the asylum seek@@ ers Act .
otherwise make the physi@@ ci@@ ans make the voice bar@@ riers .
so far , the Berlin Health scientists in The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated a number of mig@@ rants attemp@@ ted to clar@@ ify other diseases .
not only in hosp@@ itals , also in medical practices , pre@@ ting costs should be taken over .
many refugees could also been helped with more gener@@ al@@ medical care projects in the emergency services sector .
and with a other diagnostic view .
under refugee camps there are about to spend much more un@@ treated dis@@ abilities , and with the juven@@ iles go there by HIV @-@ declaration .
with the partially many diseases of disease , German doctors from their apprenti@@ ces@@ hip , but clear Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; par@@ as@@ ite anti@@ arr@@ ative or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as hard to det@@ ect . &quot; and what the doctors knew , was even better by the refugees even a change in sight .
the Syri@@ ans have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
however , in order to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification , and if they re@@ ject the ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees in Germany in@@ coming refugees according to the Federal Psych@@ other@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic Progr@@ ammer ( BP@@ t@@ K ) is mentally ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress or de@@ pression .
especially mat@@ ely , refugee children , declar@@ es Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the BP@@ t@@ K .
a recent study published by TU Munich , pro@@ claim that every fifth refugees had trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany every fifth .
whoever believes in a post@@ trau@@ matic stress in a post@@ trau@@ matic stress , is suff@@ ers among others in the so @-@ called Flash@@ back@@ s with bre@@ aths , sw@@ ing@@ hood , heart ras@@ cal and death .
more symptoms are sleeping and concentration camps , severe ad@@ iness and emot@@ ional dis@@ cover@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms were chronic , whether they had an early therapy , Mun@@ z declared .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ olog@@ ically ill refugees have a psych@@ otherapy .
indeed , psych@@ olog@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide a motion for a Psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months .
moreover , in the social compet@@ itors , Sach@@ be@@ arbeiter or Doc@@ tors are not trained to mental dis@@ orders , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this is often favour@@ able to false , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; st@@ resses Steph@@ es mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ normal@@ ities in the attitude of circulation are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst will also focus on this position : &quot; if it does not work on our animals , it does not take it well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents are enjo@@ ying each mat@@ ters .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sten , &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , is read after the possibility of each desire of their eyes .
we will work together with animals and have fun with them .

Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the steps at the beginning of the year .

Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces up to 30.000 work@@ stations
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to generate 25.000 to 30.000 work@@ stations in the framework of re@@ struc@@ turing and savings efforts for the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will split up two b@@ ör@@ ized companies and the computer and pr@@ inters business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and its service activities .
the expected job t@@ wi@@ down leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; this re@@ struc@@ turing measures will enable a competitive cost , more sustainable cost @-@ structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard enterprise , said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Ch@@ air@@ woman and Chief Executive Officer .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a small and stronger focus than the HP today is , and we have a broad and deep@@ est portfolio of shops , support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better than ever before to satis@@ fy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; is to be supplied to providing complete technology solutions for companies , so as a statement by company .
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 19@@ 30s of the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , to produce electrical equipment and Palo Alto Garage , which is called the bir@@ th@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;

FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team m@@ ates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb is behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger st@@ ressed across Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only in September and if his rehabil@@ itation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history is his participation in the next summer at the European Championship .
the great shame about this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had completed the last season after a separate buttons inj@@ ury , then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; this kind of inj@@ ury does not threatened the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bones which healed not .
this is no greater issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with its ank@@ ings or with the inju@@ ries , which he had previously .
this may be true from pure medical sight , but like W@@ enger also recognized , there is the corresponding danger of further inju@@ ries , wh@@ en@@ ever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it develops a pleasant patterns .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd . 23 different diseases by Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut there were six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ing in the last five game times .
the wider image for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been recorded in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs , most of the inju@@ ries .
W@@ enger accepted the potential of a devil &apos;s journey , but Arsenal believe that an improvement in the inju@@ ries rate during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an inj@@ ury , you have an estimated time period , a time to strengthen your body and struggle to win , &quot; said W@@ enger .
jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope to have stabil@@ ized his body , I am conf@@ id@@ ent that he will do it and he will run a career of the way that he des@@ erv@@ es .
Arsenal begins its Champions League @-@ season at the Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the game against Chelsea at Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur on next Wednesday , and W@@ enger introduces a Rot@@ ation within the teams .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey does not have travel@@ ed according to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta is starting to start with Art@@ eta .
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o MON@@ RE@@ AL and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; I &apos;m trying to keep the balance and the players who need it , a small sn@@ ap @-@ on break , &quot; said W@@ enger .
even though sen@@ al clear fav@@ or@@ ites , F will continue to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the places with the largest cont@@ ag@@ itation impact in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; unbe@@ atable &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
the stadium was made on Tuesday night through an earthquake , and was measured at the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the apprenti@@ ces@@ hip of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains del@@ igh@@ ted from the ready hope to lead the association to its first European economic victory .
&quot; this drive is imm@@ ense , &quot; said W@@ enger .
ar@@ sen@@ al has never been ready for ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are no dre@@ amed .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that talk about us for serious lessons
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obviously , particularly in regard to the need for males , is now able to prove himself as a doubt as ever since the needs of young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high range .
in 2013 , it was the most important death cause for men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to take the problem , the Camp@@ aign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a inher@@ ent life ) in 2015 than the year of man to ask the goal of looking for them to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
a current survey at more than 2,000 high school students en@@ de@@ pressed with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms that if the bodies had a sufficient percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; its chan@@ ces of pleas@@ ures doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pres@@ sive , hal@@ ved a circle of mental topics for risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have some friends yet to work for friendship .
in the Age of Social Media &apos;s social media , foc@@ using on the substance of substance , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a mean@@ ing@@ ful contact .
our digital life have the need to appear substantial , vi@@ vid and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated by reality .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by domin@@ ating what psych@@ ologists of extr@@ ater@@ als values , money , image , social status , all at the costs in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic values - our inner sights according to personal development and friendship ar@@ ises on our spiritual health a much de@@ eper .
and how a vide@@ og@@ ame of invent@@ or and Milli@@ on@@ aire told recently , money can not buy luck .
the museum was friends that this focus was on the head .
every character has not been identified by his work , but by his person@@ ality , it sh@@ ining through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers are frequent U@@ mar@@ ies , Mom@@ ents with the football gu@@ ill@@ ings in cozy arm@@ chairs and the tend@@ encies of Ross to Rachel - all this came out from the knowledge that men may rel@@ ate to each case , even though they often have to return to explore their fe@@ el@@ ings .
as one employee in the telephone line it said to me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who are de@@ pres@@ sive and self @-@ ord@@ end@@ ang@@ ered , has really clearly shown how the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who wish to contact us is often not able to talk with friends .

di Maria meets her to help PS@@ G , Malm@@ ö to cr@@ ush
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bl@@ aise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani went to Malm@@ ö with Bl@@ aise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh
di Mary meets his debut in the Champions League at the Tuesday and hel@@ ping PS@@ G to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh on Cav@@ ani held the Champions League at Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory on Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ parking stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ u@@ ts as PS@@ G players , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities , before they finally succeeded to increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head door .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ jor Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes place Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only the qualification for K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Round , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ es in any of the last three camp@@ a@@ ign@@ s .
but while they were the score , it was not a classic game by Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ im@@ ov@@ ics missed opportunity ahead of the gate . he became later in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began distribut@@ ing his lith@@ ography , began in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our counter@@ s problems , even if there are certain things we must still be perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good example .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I am sorry that we had not yet another one or two more gates . &quot;
I@@ brah@@ im@@ ovic returned to his inj@@ ury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was on the weekend a 2 : 2 draw on its own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was po@@ ached in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller became known as the man , the PS@@ G was taken on the next level in Europe , when he ran to the next month of Manchester United , when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö painting , before he completed Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the net .
however , if a man believed that PS@@ G would be a big victory , the time was dis@@ appointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic in an play @-@ off , to reach this stage , joined the st@@ iff with nine national players on the field , and was bo@@ ost@@ ed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in Central feld .
but except for a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ apps in the 34@@ th minute , they offered it little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G would sometimes be sometimes taken up , with some patches and worse , not least by I@@ brah@@ im@@ ovic , who was abandoned with no less than five attemp@@ ts alone in the first half , after rip@@ ening was used after the rest@@ art .
non@@ eth@@ eless , he demonstrated much more st@@ ick when he turned his play into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ brah@@ im@@ ovic , Di Maria in a turning point which was given from Wil@@ and to the 5@@ 2nd Minute to the post per minute ...
finally , after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans had its sixth se@@ asonal , after I@@ brah@@ im@@ ovic had lost an left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this finished all the idea that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only a excellent input from Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to David Lu@@ iz , could not keep the final result before the Gol@@ e@@ zzi became a gate at the end .
the book of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave up that PS@@ G played a Class over his team and the Norwegian said , &quot; Our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we played in the Swedish League , which won &apos;t the same level as the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
there is a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz almost 500 years after the Re@@ formation .
in the presence of town @-@ President Ign@@ az@@ io Marino , a well @-@ known square in the park on the Opp@@ io hill is bapt@@ ised on the name of the German re@@ form@@ ators .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now hon@@ oured as the &quot; German the@@ olog@@ ian of the Re@@ formation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was en@@ rolled in Rome by the Council of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Protest@@ ant Lutheran congregation in Rome , remin@@ ded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants living in the town of the pop@@ es were attracted more than a min@@ ority often only in secret its faith .
in a sym@@ bo@@ lic way the tradition of Christian faith in Rome should be visible in a sym@@ bo@@ lic way .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) served as young August@@ ine fri@@ ars by the year 1510 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a perfect sin@@ ners .
his negative phr@@ ases could be pressed him according to hist@@ orian in his later fight against Rome .
in 1991 , Luther was di@@ ver@@ ted with his th@@ eses against the las@@ h@@ ings of the Western Church .
hamm@@ ers invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilded ) Sle@@ eping cylinder is one of the principal works that has painted the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost Updated the introduction and biography .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible which is now published with outstanding photos .
at the beginning , the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt , who form@@ ulates his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and screen in 150 mot@@ ives .
his &quot; language &quot; with color@@ ful colors and imag@@ in@@ ative forms did receive the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is consist@@ ently equal with &quot; funny and pictures .
on the contrary : the respective issues can be adapted easily .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project that he has made a sub@@ j@@ ective @-@ artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; Bu@@ ches of all books . &quot;
originated by cycles , which are such as the way of the Cross , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity .
thus he is a way back to several partners : this is true of the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological align@@ ment , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who gave himself up to painting with the respective bi@@ bel@@ lies .
it is interpre@@ ted by Ot@@ mar Alt selected biology and thus into Today , into current comp@@ uting . &quot;
these ly@@ rics are like a f@@ ading mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
Embedded is embedded in the original Bible quote from Martin Luther , together with a sentence of the artist , which is form@@ ulated here his personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the be@@ ading band has golden le@@ vers .
with the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is equal to a low in@@ sight into his soul , his emot@@ ions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emot@@ ions were ulti@@ mat@@ ely at all trig@@ gers for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and was born in Berlin in 1940 , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Order .
&quot; the ev@@ asion is already happening in the tube structure , &quot; remin@@ ds Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; I have attemp@@ ted to re@@ gre@@ t me to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
his second order is to save up to more job again : &quot; the perc@@ eption of pixels is influ@@ enced by Rec@@ l@@ ame today , and it is loud .
Sym@@ bo@@ lics is because of it .
artists have a different desire and desire , to show things .
have always something of secre@@ tly and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to watch the viewer in the pictures &quot; suggest@@ s , discover and feel that the force they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his object . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in der Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; already &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like to understand how he under@@ stands with his pictures life . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to watch the Bible too comp@@ ass@@ ed the Bible but chosen for him most important and myst@@ eri@@ ous them@@ es .
&quot; that was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is the pictures that explains only . &quot; it was created a picture of pictures .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; his life to be deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler for both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility of responsibility .
a part of origin@@ als - paper and linen pattern - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn near the BM@@ X
plans were made , place , company instruc@@ ts to build a round trip : one year later , almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was finally finished .
fail@@ ures in politics and management provided for d@@ ying , especially with the inhabitants that would not en@@ du@@ p the rail .
so little hills moved up , new space - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval could go in October , the first Municipal Council could join Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock in the kinder@@ garten and youth committee .
&quot; I hope that this year still happens , &quot; she said .
this will be without &quot; more Comm@@ it@@ ations &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees

&quot; I am responsible for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ un@@ ification . &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle , I don &apos;t talk about it , I have nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; it has to be interested in any single , this subject in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B Chef Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to improve the refugee status in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet his State Minister for Mr@@ s Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the lawyer . &quot;
&quot; the topic is to play a central role , &quot; announced on .
the football is hel@@ ping to help .
but the decisive turn@@ around has to provide the policy .
the German S@@ occ@@ er Federation has therefore expanded its refugee @-@ initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; on the out@@ skirts of the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Brown Foundation , we have ensu@@ red that this program will continue to pass through 2019 , &quot; N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach announced on the edge of the UEFA Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some states now support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ an en@@ set a clear sign when they are used in the left pu@@ ff@@ les instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ bers ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We help - # Re@@ fuge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make that all help , where and how they can only can , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen &quot; Sport@@ ster Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) , and called &quot; Self @-@ employed . &quot;
&quot; the refugee dr@@ ama shows everyone , nobody can be seen . &quot;
&quot; we can use football rights activ@@ ists , no , we must use our jet force , our influence and our ways to help the many refugees who have already so un@@ belie@@ vable , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
h@@ opes , managing director Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; promin@@ ent characters of the le@@ ague . &quot;
for the European qualif@@ ier against Hungary on this Friday , the national team invites for 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as a &quot; large commun@@ ist &quot; German football . &quot;
that all 36 licens@@ ing would have started their own projects in their own projects would be great .
the same great , that small and smallest are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , which we have spent , is living in football .
&quot; this is the enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this year the German association , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government comes to 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the contract has already initiated the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .

Robot@@ ed@@ cars : government plans for Germany
according to the wishes of the German government , the Federal Government must be techn@@ ological in techn@@ ological leadership according to the future .
the Federal kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategic paper from the house of traffic authority Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which has investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke at the out@@ skirts of the Autom@@ esse Motor Show in Frankfurt on the edge of the &quot; new mobile timer . &quot;
the automated and net@@ worked ride will raise the transport security and exp@@ ense for less st@@ akes , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the topic of its counter@@ part in the G7 , which will also come together with representatives of the industry at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
the Strateg@@ ic paper of the Transport of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a gener@@ al@@ ert on digital radio recordings .
a test run of new technology is currently taking a test run on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
with the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions , &quot; and , where necessary , to adap@@ t to the new developments . &quot;
so Germany is interested in Germany around the world that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the federal government plans to insert for a change in the Vienna Convention , which now sees only the people as a driver .
when driving on automated driving , the car takes over the guide , the driver will end more and more for passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that process the environment and work the data into seconds .
following a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be techn@@ ically possible by 2020 .
in spite of this , driving @-@ free vehicles will be expected to expect just far to 2020 . &quot;
the study added in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 on around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital net@@ working of the car can contri@@ bute to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; the SPD road cr@@ itic of Sören Bar@@ to@@ l said .
the question of liability upon accid@@ ents and safety of personal data of driver gre@@ etings is clearly explained .
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars , however , are sk@@ ep@@ tical - a lot more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA proposed survey of the For@@ sa Institute in order of test preparation DE@@ KR@@ A is coming to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that their aut@@ onomous cars could pass through to 32 percent in the next ten years , 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed by 2025 with aut@@ onomous cars , only 33 per cent .
in addition , motor@@ cycli@@ sts in Germany are not ready to leave on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the BI@@ T@@ KO@@ M collection , only seven percent of the BI@@ T@@ KO@@ M would have to match any of the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , traffic could imagine 15 percent , at St@@ au 45 percent .
good , everyone would over@@ load the car to control under no circumstances .

if you dies , you get into the Museum .
the impressive collection had previously made at the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station in advance .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunst@@ halle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .

today , this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Belgian army .
instead , the fashion is important .
in the beginning times of the pl@@ au@@ ener head , fashion has played a larger role , then it became possible by the home @-@ textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .

to avoid the competition from the Asian region , you need to find quality and innovative products .
that need time and cour@@ age .
it ar@@ ises a voltage range between the fresh ideas of designer and companies that must remember most econom@@ ically , &quot; says Schmidt .

EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ limit value in smoking fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large fi@@ b@@ fish , and consumption thus avoid@@ ing a significantly higher dose of nerv@@ ous .
the consumer organization Fo@@ od@@ watch , which lies a corresponding paper station@@ ed in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans to say : &quot; risks and ad@@ verse events will be hand@@ led with full walls in pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from Fo@@ od@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limits of the nerv@@ es for big fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; can be raised by one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kg of fish .
although great rob@@ bers occur today so strong with mer@@ cury , that the estimated limit values are not sold around 50 per cent of the yield .
according to the limit of the bound@@ ary , only 14.5 percent of the limits would be po@@ ison@@ ous .
in re@@ treat for this subject , the EU according to Fo@@ od@@ watch the limit values in other fish from currently amounts to 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram .
Fo@@ od@@ cast this , however , called &quot; Tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller pe@@ ac@@ tic bodies , such as cardi@@ ov@@ ens usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values of today .
therefore , the Ab@@ sen@@ ing in Kl@@ einf@@ isch was therefore , &quot; a per@@ fi@@ able Abl@@ age man@@ eu@@ ver , which helps in the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mer@@ cury is one of the people highly toxic heavy metal that strongly en@@ rich@@ ed over the food chain in space .
the Federal Government war@@ ns that &quot; already small amounts are particularly inf@@ lic@@ ted in the b@@ orns of the nerv@@ ous system .
