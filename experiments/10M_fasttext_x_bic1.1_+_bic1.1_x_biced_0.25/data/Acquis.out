a reag@@ ent to blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen containing the antibodies or another in the label substance homogen@@ ol@@ og .
if a reag@@ ent is used in the manufacturer recommended , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not appear : a ) em@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the Tit@@ er is measured in a suitable medium by always further di@@ lution of the re@@ di@@ lution of the re@@ Probe .
the Tit@@ er is the real value of the number of the strongest server di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated only by the volume of blood cells in total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which should be used on object dreams , activity will be expressed by the time , which is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object bearer .
the World Health Organisation has established for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ D as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood group determination international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other speci@@ f@@ ity will be implemented at the time of standards .
according to definition , a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of titles that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the reag@@ ent to blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ ities are expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ st@@ ites , which is observed in a series of th@@ inner at a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ ten@@ tion loss .
the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ents in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ent to blood group determination are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the tit@@ ration of unknown reag@@ ents in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .
if one brings them back to a volume of 1 ml , so the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B are included according to definition 256 international units per ml .

the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative tit@@ ration of the International standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the manufacturer recommended conditions , its required properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es in flu@@ essi@@ ger form , according to label , is one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
this on the label due to the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ acting is aimed at the results of the re@@ ten@@ dencies ; it is appro@@ ach@@ able by government agencies .
dried re@@ acts are kept in an atmosphere of iner@@ ary gas or in a vacuum , while in the glass container in which they have dried dried and which is closed , so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ actor may not lose weight than 0.5 v.@@ h of its weight , if it is tested by more drying over phosph@@ oral pent@@ ox@@ y at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
for avoiding bacterial growth , the state @-@ state authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the dr@@ ills provided ) is added to an ant@@ is@@ ep@@ tics and / or antibiot@@ ic if the in@@ fusion with the added substance remains the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites to specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin of the blood @-@ group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml flu@@ essi@@ gen or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the reag@@ ents , especially if in flu@@ ent form or after recovery , must be transparent and may not contain any se@@ di@@ ments or visible particles .
the requirements for the international exchange of particular reag@@ ents for blood group determination should not be artificial , at least as long as not until an international agreement has come about a uniform system .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are based on such a way and in such quantities that it is not only able to carry tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount specified in a container must be so large that the contents may be used in this protocol that may be used in this protocol can be used .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has over all production levels and controls the reag@@ ents to result written records .
appropriate samples of all prec@@ eded reag@@ ents are so long from the laboratory to store up to some probability , that the batch can no longer be used .
the reag@@ ent determination used to contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary tools for rein@@ forcement of the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the reag@@ ents .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups according to their actual percentage .
that does not mean that the reag@@ ent human origin may contain substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents may not contain substances of human origin .
there is a black @-@ printed label based on each container , which contains the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,

the following requirements for the efficacy of Sera to determine the R@@ h group may possibly alter if International standard prepar@@ ate are available ( . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ grupp@@ en@@ serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not included with human @-@ red blood cells that don &apos;t contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Sera must have a title of at least 1 : 32 versus c@@ c@@ de@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard pre@@ par@@ ate of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparison to c@@ c@@ de@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum should be able to respond to blood cells , the Do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Sera , which are intended for use of object dreams according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed up to a py@@ c@@ de@@ e blood cells at about 40 ° C within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely within 120 seconds .

anti @-@ E Sera , which are intended for use on object dreams according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed up to approximately 40 ° C in one object containing a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be extracted directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time by the manufacturer specified reaction conditions .
