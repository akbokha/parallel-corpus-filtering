the present document is a summary of the European Public Transport Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which will be explained as the Committee for Human@@ itarian ( CH@@ MP ) in which the Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has been evaluated in order to proceed to recommendations on the use of the drug .
if you require further information about your illness or treatment , please read the pack@@ et age ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for entry ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injec@@ tion@@ ing solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , mist@@ rust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic condition , in which the patients have different episodes ( periods of abnormal senti@@ ment ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe Man@@ ical episodes and to prevent man@@ ical episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for quick control of distur@@ bing ag@@ itation or behavi@@ oral disorders , if oral intake is not possible .
in both cases , the solution for inser@@ tion or melting tablets are applied in patients with which the gor@@ ges of tablets are processed .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is thought of mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist , &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and will be prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recovery of the symptoms was investigated in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or similar diseases resulting in increased rest@@ less@@ ness , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was reduced over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which had been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients with which the man@@ ian symptoms were stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ ing solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that were compared to increased ag@@ itation by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment .
the company also took studies in order to investigate how the body gets the melting tablets and the solution to take @-@ up ( decreases ) .
in both studies with the injec@@ tion@@ ing solution for patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly higher reduction in symptoms increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a placebo .
in the application of the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ time studies .
in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ ve effects of Man@@ ical episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced significantly more effective than placebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , vomiting , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision ( increased memory production ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( dizziness ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety disorders .
the committee on Human@@ itarian agents ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from middle @-@ severe episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in contrast to the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution for rapid control of distur@@ bing un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the distribution of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode of patients , the mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proved , although some patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as a mono@@ - or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients suffering from 65 years was not proved .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are just@@ i@@ fiable ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the arith@@ me@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of anti @-@ psychological therapy , also for treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , no increased su@@ icides risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used to treat patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that followed one year or less , there were occasional reports during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if in case of an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ mus , should be taken into consideration , reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient has developed signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the an@@ am@@ ni@@ es or cases that are related to sei@@ zu@@ res .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis who are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ wanted zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ja or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic medication @-@ treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ its , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally known in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics where weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy life of life and might lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the central nervous system is careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically .
in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chinese in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be performed similar dose reductions .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ising can result the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible metabolism .
if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should over@@ weigh the potential risks for the patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed .
after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age height before the onset of the esc@@ ale therapy .
di@@ lat@@ ex or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 in common with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate increase of the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ am@@ orph@@ an / 3 Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients should be given to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the in@@ adequate data situation for the safety in humans and due to the reproductive studies in the animal may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit just@@ ifies the potential risk of the fo@@ etus .
however , as in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , and they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative impact on them .
the following side effects occurred more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ ilo were treated with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients received under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in another controlled study study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medic@@ ally significant differences .
increases by CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ logi@@ stical syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ism , un@@ wanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ do@@ si@@ xes have been observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis treatment in the treatment of a su@@ re@@ ation with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; it is unlikely that hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an overdose of benefit is , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma binding .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4 , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 ad@@ r@@ ying and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in doses of 0,5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the Pos@@ it@@ ons Emission @-@ tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and in the cleaning .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 Shi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of patients who had a response to study medications were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring structures , defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depression @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate showed at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ ol group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a total of 3@@ 14 patients ( N = 18 or 13 % of valuable patient data ) significantly decreased a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy compared to placebo in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ - study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active controlled mono@@ - studies in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a positive effect on placebo in week 3 and an experience effect that was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ie on like Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which showed partial over 2 weeks not on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy , an superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ian symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in various patients who were achieved with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation period prior to placebo in relation to prevention of a bi@@ polar return , primarily in the prevention of a bi@@ polar return .
based on in vitro diagnostic studies , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ z@@ ole , which is responsible for the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ung by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average elimination season is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabol@@ ising over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for nearly 146 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation of Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity or the effect of the room on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ ic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to pull anchor on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , reproduction of tox@@ icity , gene ot@@ ox@@ icity , and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the pre @-@ clinical data could not recognize any special dangers for human beings .

in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a total of 3@@ 14 patients ( N = 18 or 13 % of valuable patient data ) significantly decreased a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ - study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has been compared to healthy volunteers with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the relationship between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max -@@ mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution for rapid control of ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ age in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection should be terminated and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to minim@@ ise the Res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , a injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under revers@@ ing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be applied depending on the individual clinical status taking into account of the drug or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a leading oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the features of the medicine to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y processed tablet or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution for mounting .
there are no investigations to the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution in patients with ag@@ itation and behavi@@ oral disorders , which caused differently to be caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in addition to a par@@ ental therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution , the patient should be observed in regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
research and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injec@@ tion@@ ing solution are not used for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used to treat patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that followed one year or less , there were occasional reports during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ ms ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ its , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally known in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ e due to comp@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics which is known for weight gain as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ d@@ ations was larger compared to a study of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in a study which was used in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular in healthy volunteers ( 15 mg dosage ) and received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed .
after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age height before the onset of the esc@@ ale therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received the intensity of se@@ d@@ ations greater compared with the following some gifts of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medic@@ ally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects occurred more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral @-@ relevant Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as possible medic@@ ally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients received under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / behavior disorders compared to placebo and was similar to like Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding ag@@ itation and behavi@@ oral disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the average improvement of the initial value of the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS excitement was 5.8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be observed due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of patients who had a response to study medications were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring structures , defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg zone scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate showed at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a total of 3@@ 14 patients ( N = 18 or 13 % of valuable patient data ) resulted in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) in an average weight of ca .

in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study of various patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed up to placebo in relation to prevention of a bi@@ polar return , primarily in the prevention of a return .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C according to the gift of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma peak at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and apes well toler@@ ated and resulted in any direct tox@@ icity of a target organs with systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum of human@@ oid exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ous .
in studies for reprodu@@ cible exposure after intraven@@ ous application , no safety relevant concerns after maternal exposure showed in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) over the maximum of human@@ oid exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , reproduction of tox@@ icity , gene ot@@ ox@@ icity , and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the pre @-@ clinical data could not recognize any special dangers for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with doses or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dose or exposure when humans have exceeded , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study , in which 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , of which approximately three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycline .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in a few gifts or as a mono@@ therapies ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
consider only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no distinction between the drugs and survival compared to the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , regarding these indicators , that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neutr@@ ality numbers in the blood before the start of treatment .
the Committee for Human Pap@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was used in patients where the first treatment was no longer so@@ iled , more effective as conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines not to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited has a approval for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ in @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ron number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
at sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until a improvement to degrees 1 or 2 is achieved , and with all the following cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ t@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there are no studies with patients with spec@@ ulation function and there is currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for the application in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for integrity and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ arti@@ kel@@ etal form@@ ulating by pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could be considerably lower pharmac@@ ological features as other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be abol@@ ished immediately and has a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no longer Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ ron number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mb@@ al number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver disorders ( bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while one clearly stated with Abra@@ x@@ ane in relation to cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the indigenous patient collective is not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycline treatment or under@@ lying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of the patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ eti@@ ka and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant or pregnant women , which are not an effective recep@@ tive prevention , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoid@@ able .
women in pre@@ valent age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable prevention method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is recommended , during and up to six months after the treatment no child testify .
male patients should be advised before treatment over a sperm accounts , because of the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of an irre@@ versi@@ bly in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and dizziness ( often ) that can affect the traffic and the ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side @-@ side effects performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ ing ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of those treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 are the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mono@@ therapies at any dose and indication in studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased liqu@@ or hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ ators in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced potassium in blood canc@@ ers :

as these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , there are no estimates of the actual frequency possible and there was no significant connection with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ active ingredient that promotes resistance of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tubes and mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ isation leads to a inhibit@@ ing of normal dynamic re@@ organisation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ul@@ tural network which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in has facil@@ itated the trans@@ oc@@ yt@@ osis of plasma components in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the context of in vitro studies , that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in &apos;s transport was encour@@ ages by endo@@ thel@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this enhanced tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al transport is communic@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( pr@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ binding studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entr@@ e study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received an allergy suffer@@ ers at pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 , as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 than 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an adverse general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ asia .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % only had a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % because of met@@ ast@@ ero@@ sion and 19 % because of met@@ ast@@ as@@ ation and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 Results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 was evaluated .
the natural process of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the Total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the linear ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml anal@@ og@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took place on a multi @-@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive external distribution and / or turn@@ out connection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el have been compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and even the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is reported primarily on 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and for two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative oil was reduced by less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a vast non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance .
over the age of more than 75 years , however , only few data are available , since only 3 patients of these age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ protected light over 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ ams is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood levels , where in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications might occur , in case prior to the procedure a blood circulation is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ ams has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
injection can also be made from the patient or the main@@ tain@@ ment@@ or , as long as they have received an appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ ost@@ atic values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ene in adults , respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the iron values of all patients are before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron ore supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel , or thereby the body does not adequ@@ ately affect the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
Ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that was associated to a gene ( DNA ) , which is responsible for the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a study of 4@@ 79 patients with 4@@ 79 patients , compared to one of kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , compared with the reference intake .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were either transferred to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indic@@ ative for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ ost@@ atic values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also used the results of a study in which the effects were spec@@ ulated by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the hem@@ ost@@ atic values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed , were calculated in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ ams is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ icking , mig@@ rant heada@@ ches and confusion .
se@@ ams should not be used in patients , which may be more sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients .
se@@ ams as injec@@ tions under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
the end of the European Union Committee ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the medicine has been implemented according to the rules of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the se@@ ams , will provide for medical specialists in all Member States information , including information about security of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce medicines at P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg a permit for the distribution of se@@ ams across the European Union .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except with p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients that should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and success data can be different depending on age , gender and total disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease management is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , patients may occasionally be observed in a patient individual hem@@ ost@@ atic values over or under hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ ost@@ atic vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ ost@@ atic value exceeds more than 2 g / d@@ dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the long @-@ lasting hem@@ ost@@ atic value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be supervised , to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is the lowest dose which is needed for control of an@@ emia and an@@ tigen symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) possibly require higher yields in patients where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) possibly require higher yields in patients where initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
starting dose 50 mg / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 mg / kg ( three times a week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and - subsequent publications may be different depending on age , gender and total disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease management is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ ost@@ atic vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be supervised , to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is the lowest dose which is needed for control of an@@ tigen symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ ost@@ atic value of at least 1 g / d@@ l. ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) , or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ancy amounts to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose should be kept up to 150 mg / kg three times a week or 450 kg / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ ost@@ atic growth was increased &lt; 1 g / d@@ um ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ te &lt; 40,000 cells / µl opposite the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 kg / kg three times a week .

if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ rate value increased by &lt; 1 g / d@@ um ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl opposite the initial value , an response to the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with light an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , with which the pre @-@ car@@ ing storage of ≥ 4 blood @-@ conservative is required , ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 kg / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before operating procedure .
with the iron sub@@ stitution , as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood pro@@ pul@@ ses - started to provide large iron reserves at the beginning of the se@@ wage therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 mg / kg ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , which should be given weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operating procedure and the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tional risk ( bone breaks ) , including in patients who suffered a decrease in trau@@ matic gu@@ ardi@@ ans such as suffering ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tion@@ ate should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or through injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms of symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and heada@@ ches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta the same is as in z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material for z@@ om@@ eta was attracted by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of vert@@ eb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a hip frac@@ tion@@ ate ; the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
in two studies , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
main indi@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood decreased or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of flu@@ xes in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis agents ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients receiving placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis group ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures were reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ tion@@ ate 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a questionnaire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and at repeated in@@ fu@@ sions less frequently .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients with potentially sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other ingredients .
as at all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ aten patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion or oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is ( die of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw@@ s .
the manufacturers of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides re@@ conn@@ aissance material for physicians to apply Ac@@ la@@ sta to the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients where the medicine effects of the medicine will be explained and pointed out when they should apply to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited has granted approval for the distribution of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • In post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tional .
for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in males a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended every year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tion@@ ate the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ tion@@ ate ( see section 5.1 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s treatment should only be prescribed by doctors , experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long term was observed in patients who have addressed to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tion@@ ate , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms that appear within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced shortly after the use of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose of dose is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data are missing for in@@ conc@@ essi@@ bility and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because of these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is before the onset of therapy with acet@@ sta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be checked in front of a use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for a dental treatment with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental handles , no data are available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates is reduced the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the or@@ tho@@ range .
clinical evaluation by the treatment doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms that appear within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced shortly after the use of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after use by Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of reported adverse events reported in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the total resistance of pre @-@ hop@@ per between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted medication effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic has been associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed as a decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases referred to as acute kidney failure .
the change of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured prior to the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , treated at 2.3 % of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the kill@@ ings of patients .
all patients have supplem@@ entary amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical trials after a hip frac@@ tures ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical fac@@ tions , according to a recent def@@ endants , the vitamin D @-@ mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen has been treated in the oral area , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primary school ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the oral area with Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of an overdose that leads to a clinical @-@ relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , may be reached by the gift of oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al disorders ( BM@@ D ) or at least two light or a medium @-@ severe existing spine or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the sky@@ scra@@ per than ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of existing fuel fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric physical frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new spine ( see Table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients of 75 years and older were reduced by 60 % compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta proved a lasting effect over three years to result in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
impact on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density in the lum@@ bar acid , hips and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatment significantly to all periods ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine around 6.7 % , the total boun@@ ces around 6.0 % , the weak radius of 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius around 3.2 % .
oste@@ hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients who were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to placebo a increased bone @-@ volume and ob@@ taining of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone attachment mark@@ er The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta dropped by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 , oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total th@@ read@@ iness and ch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als for all periods .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total revenues and 4.3 % on the scra@@ per h@@ uts .
clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study , 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients evaluated the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction in clinical trials in men ; the incidence of clinical trials was 7.5 % at Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % with placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) once again an annual meeting of Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to the weekly gift of al@@ en@@ dr@@ en@@ at relative to the percentage point of change of the Len@@ den@@ i@@ bel @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone of Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light until moderate mor@@ nings Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ chens ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2,@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to taking 30 mg of frac@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
according to the combined results , a similar decrease of pain strength and pain @-@ affected has been observed in comparison to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate for 6 months .
patients who were classified as a respon@@ sive study at the end of the six month ( based on the therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up period .
of the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of the patients who were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , could be preserved in a medium term of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ one and multiple 5 @-@ 15 minute in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ ing independent .
afterwards , the plasma concentration quickly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
fast @-@ phase disappearance of the large cycle with half @-@ value times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a season of elimination of elimination season t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tory over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours you can find 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose in urine , while the rest mainly is bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ cle@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes , metabolic substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is non @-@ metabolic and because they are not a weak or not a direct and / or ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al cle@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this makes a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney @-@ function up to a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance to 35 ml / min does not require a dose of dose to the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
because of severe kidney disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted data are not possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ effective intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
in trials involving dogs were single doses ranging from 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al impair@@ ment .
sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application has been identified as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , corresponding to the 7@@ fold the humane therapeutic exposure ) , related to the AU@@ C , is well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions that the maximum of the planned human exposure occurred sufficiently , toxic effects of other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common findings in studies with repeated application was a prolifer@@ ated primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ vity of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , a satisfaction , which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .

decreasing hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age levels , especially o@@ est@@ rogen , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
when Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure to quickly , and new bone material is set un@@ arranged , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta appears , norm@@ alizes the bone structure , thereby ensured a normal bone formation and therefore gives the bone to its bones .
if you are in dental treatment or under@@ go a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in use of Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nur@@ ses when you use other medicines / apply / applied / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know whether you are medic@@ ally known , of which it is known for the kidneys .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Service Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which will be explained as the Committee for Human@@ itarian agents ( CH@@ MP ) to proceed to recommendations on the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , with which Met@@ form@@ in ( diabe@@ tic medicine ) is used . • It can be used together with another diabe@@ tic medicine ( dual therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , the met@@ form@@ in alone can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ du@@ ous material or insulin can be kept the previous dose of sul@@ fi@@ yl@@ lic acid or insulin delivery , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ lic acid and insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be used better and the blood sugar level decreases , elimin@@ ating type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in using a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ lic , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the glucose levels have been lowered when using the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional gift of action to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ lic material in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin has been examined in 289 patients , the patients suffering from Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin took a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % of the patients who took placebo in addition .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were bl@@ ur@@ red vision , infections of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts ( cold cuts ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients with potentially sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or diabe@@ tic acid ( high ket@@ ones - acid level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to establish an auth@@ orization of action from Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one page the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or disorder ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years no data are available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. prior cardi@@ ac infar@@ ction or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ de@@ ms , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and eyel@@ ids , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ac disease out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and advanced pharmac@@ ological disease was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of a liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror are increased to 3 times the limit of the standard range , the liver cells are as soon as possible to control again as soon as possible .
if a patient develop symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , em@@ esis , upper @-@ degra@@ dation , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark hard@@ n , are the liver ability to check .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued until the presentation of the laboratory parameters will be conducted by clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can touch of li@@ pos@@ al deposits , and in some cases connected with a fluid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a hem@@ og@@ ame , a minor reduction in the medium hem@@ ost@@ atic values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) appeared .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ lic acid or as a two @-@ step combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dos@@ ing hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
after the launch in the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ di@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , about an occurr@@ ence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ ms reported in a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular de@@ ms when patients report on the vision of vision ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of un@@ wanted events concerning bone bro@@ ods from randomised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the calculated frac@@ tional incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the PRO@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years ) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparable medi@@ ation .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to pregnancy or enter this , the treatment is ab@@ out@@ dated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines prescribed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ or are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on for 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attributable to the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ insulin and increased insulin resistance to the parent , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( of this data is not estimated ) .
they lead to a temporary change of the tower and refra@@ ction of lenti@@ ls , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drug ingredients .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ pin came across the three times the upper limit of the normal range as far as placebo , but less than in compar@@ ative groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an out@@ come study in patients with existing pharmac@@ ological disease , the frequency of a severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1,6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ an .
since its launch , rarely over heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was reported , however , more frequently if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ orous .
there was a summar@@ izing analysis of un@@ wanted events concerning bone bro@@ ods from randomised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated in the compar@@ ative groups .
in the over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparable medi@@ ation .
during taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day after seven days there were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears on an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) , resulting in the animal model to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton cells .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study conducted by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mono@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mono@@ la@@ zi@@ d was continued over two years to investigate the period until the reproduction of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months months ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ sufficient , despite three @-@ phase optimi@@ zing phase with insulin , to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continue to continue insulin ; a reduction of insulin injec@@ tions were observed in the group of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ation compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mono@@ - with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , based on 18 weeks of study on type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma @-@ tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel and slightly higher , but clin@@ ically not increased L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in comparison to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , there was no statistically significant increase in the L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ erior margin of tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , both of a effect on tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption , as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the PRO@@ active study , a cardi@@ ac disease out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced pharmac@@ ological disease were random@@ ized in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy , either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the top concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma is usually 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interventions studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral use of radioactive in@@ active pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the cases ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination season of un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the entire active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance is similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , agreed after repeated administration with plasma volume enlargement , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ troph@@ ic .
this is due to that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the insulin resistance of hyper@@ insulin and increased insulin resistance of the parent is dimin@@ ished , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .
long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years old ) were induced by hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( male rats ) of the ure@@ tic epithel@@ ium .
in a animal model of the family @-@ known poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment led with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ di@@ ons to an elevated frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ tional incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the PRO@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years ) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparable medi@@ ation .
in another study about two years the effects of a combination of combination of met@@ form@@ in , with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ d were studied .
clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ation compared to the initial values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but improved the post@@ erior margin increased tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , which is both above a effect on tr@@ y@@ glyc@@ eride absorption and also on h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was missing the goal of its primary end@@ point , a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , stro@@ kes , acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ isation , leg amp@@ utation above the Kn@@ uck@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are not connected to cardiovascular risk .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was administered in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as is not able to produce insulin and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which indicates that the blood sugar level is similar to a similar human resource .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may not react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human@@ insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can effect on blood sugar ( the complete list is the package age ) .
the Human@@ itarian Committee ( CH@@ MP ) committee jum@@ ped to the conclusion that the advantages of acet@@ ph@@ ane increased in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a approval for the distribution of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane across the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a fast initi@@ als effect will be desired with a longer lasting effect .
injection boxes must be consumed at least 6 seconds long under the skin , to ensure that the whole dose is inj@@ ected .
patients , whose blood glucose is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ glyc@@ emia warning systems can be changed and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ effective , bi@@ phase insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , Human@@ ism or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNS versus insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause that a change in dosage is required .
if switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose of dose is required , it may be necessary during the first dosage or months after conversion .
some patients receiving hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal insulin injec@@ tions , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ glyc@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin .
prior to travel , who are going to pass over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , since such travels , insulin and meals must be applied to other times .
the doctor therefore needs to consider possible inter@@ actions in the therapy , and his patients have always been asking for some of them recorded medicines .

however , hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be progres@@ sively developing : • Light hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugar @-@ related foods .
diabe@@ tics therefore should always have grapes , sweets , biscuits or sugar fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid bul@@ lock or by glucose which is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum capacity is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total length of time is up to 24 hours .
Res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption Profile is based on the product to act with a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a range of spra@@ yer ( hydro@@ ly@@ se@@ - ) places on the Human@@ insulin molecule were drawn into consideration ; none of the met@@ abol@@ ites formed by the split @-@ formed met@@ abol@@ ites is active .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Transport Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which will be explained as the Committee for Human@@ itarian ( CH@@ MP ) in which the Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has been evaluated in order to proceed to recommendations on the use of the drug .
the in@@ effective effective element in Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , insulin ( r@@ DNA ) , is manufactured using the method of so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant Technology &quot; :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu © EMEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business affairs ? how was Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d studied ?
Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who may seem sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ pi@@ d may need to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can effect on blood sugar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when two types of insulin can be mixed , first the amount of fast @-@ acting insulin must first be mounted , then the amount of insulin is working .
3 If changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in patients a dose of dose is required , it may be necessary during the first dosage or months after conversion .
prior to travel , who are going to pass over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , since such travels , insulin and meals must be applied to other times .
5 General disorders and complaints at the administration site of Gel@@ eg@@ ent - Local Transm@@ iti@@ vity reaction on injec@@ tions during insulin therapy can occur local convic@@ tions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma on injection ) .
diabe@@ tics therefore should always have grapes , sweets , biscuits or sugar fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid bul@@ lock or by glucose which is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical attempt in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mol / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients underwent surgical interventions ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mol / l ) reduced the mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum capacity is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the overall duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was investigated at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and youth ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited , however , the assumption suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents are similar to adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in concentrations 0.05 % / ml - 1.0 ml / ml insulin @-@ in human in the in@@ fusion fluid , 0.9 % sodium chloride , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % glucose glucose with 40 m@@ mol / l potassium chloride are stable at room temperature for 24 hours .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already feature signs of cryst@@ alline systems , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or pal@@ sy notes ( &quot; stones &quot; that can result greater urine cryst@@ alline systems that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary bar is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to 120 mg daily .
during the first treatment months , gre@@ y@@ an@@ cies can still occur ; therefore , the patient is recommended for at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transpl@@ ant since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to placebo ( one other medicines for treating hypertension ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received just 100 mg per day .
the main indic@@ ative of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid level in the blood was below 6 mg / d@@ dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients who had aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once daily had 120 mg per day , with the last three measurements a ur@@ inary level in the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values .
in particular , in patients with heart failure in the history there is also an elevated risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the committee on Human@@ itarian agents ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary acid in the blood more than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one of the patient &apos;s history known or currently present gre@@ ens and / or a g@@ ust of arthritis ) .
if the serum concentration of 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still more &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney problems , efficacy and safety have not been investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and youth since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ u@@ e@@ av@@ oc@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
organ transp@@ lan@@ ders There are no experiences yet with organ transpl@@ ant@@ ers , the application of Feb@@ u@@ e@@ av@@ oc@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with endemic cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ frau@@ dul@@ ent heart failure is not recommended the treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ acid drugs , it may occur during the treatment of acute g@@ ushing , because by lowering the serum @-@ acid level , ur@@ inary deposits initially can be mobi@@ lized in the tissues .
B. during mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ i Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine occurs in rare cases so far that it comes to a deposit in ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease During the phase 3 clinical studies of the liver working values were observed with Feb@@ u@@ rop@@ or@@ ate patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended , before the start of Feb@@ u@@ er@@ us treatment and further course , depending on clinical trials and one liver function test ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was performed no interaction studies to Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ e@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ t ( a inhibit@@ ing of metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ) was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors .
the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ e@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times daily is associated with a rise in Feb@@ u@@ er@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not in connection with a clinical significant increase of adverse events .

in a study conducted with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily has an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak effect of Feb@@ r@@ ux@@ e@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous taking of an ant@@ acids , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , the absorption of Feb@@ u@@ rop@@ at ( around 1 hour ) delay and a reduction in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change of AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies do not allow to side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or child@@ birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when purchasing a vehicle , serve machines , or practice hazardous activities , until they can be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect its performance .

the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 up to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could be performed in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ u@@ per@@ ate and in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once reported are listed below .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies , no severe skin suggestions or heavy sensiti@@ v@@ ities were observed .
7 Open @-@ time extension studies In the open long @-@ time extension studies have been treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients were treated with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events during the long @-@ term - extension studies reported previously reported events that were reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment related events were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ pr@@ - treatment groups a total of more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an ex@@ position of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to the data .
the following treatment related events were either reported either in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with which the last three month specific serum concentration of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) were included .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with an serum concentration of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) compared to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80@@ mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were obtained for analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg .
lowering of the serum concentration on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintain permanently about the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in sub@@ group of patients with kidney disease restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney disease ( d. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clinical differences in regard to the percentage of serum concentration of serum concentration in subjects , ir@@ respective of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney problems ) .
primary end@@ point in sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration of 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L .
the data collected in two years from the open extension study phase 3 showed that the long @-@ term reduction in serum concentration of &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) revealed a decrease in the incidence of tox@@ ins ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a pal@@ sy ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the g@@ uts size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the dam@@ n notes by the month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long@@ time extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations increased ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) by Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at once more simple and multi@@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ ing propor@@ tioned increase .
after taking a simple or multi @-@ cou@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2,8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,3 µg / ml .
however , no clinical significant change in the percentage of serum concentration was observed , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is ranging from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein connection of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary li@@ aison an alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved through the concentration of concentration , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg , constant .
in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ som@@ en showed that this oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites are formed mainly by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 and that Feb@@ . 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 are created .

in addition to the termination of the urine over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair as un@@ changeable Feb@@ u@@ ene ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency After intake multi@@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with lighter , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of Feb@@ u@@ per@@ ate was not altered in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean overall AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ er@@ oc@@ at increased about the 1.8 times of 7.5 m / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 m . h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function limitation After intake multi@@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC ( Child P@@ ugh Classi@@ fication A ) or medium @-@ heavier ( Child P@@ ugh Classi@@ fication B ) liver function limitation changed significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There are no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multi@@ pler oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are incub@@ ated ) in women after men@@ opause , a risk of low vitamin D mirrors .
the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or use of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also introduced a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the share of patients with low vitamin D @-@ mirror had been treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively Al@@ en@@ dr@@ en@@ at income ( 32 % ) .
the company also put data on the basis that the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE contained al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose is the same dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , block@@ age , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarrhea ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( bl@@ ender stomach ) and aci@@ dic stomach .
in patients with high sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other ingredients may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be applied in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who do not stand upright or sit at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or use of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to follow exactly to reduce the risk of ös@@ sing irrit@@ ation and associated side @-@ side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swallowed up after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a consists of . • The patients should not be carried out before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords , were reported in patients under taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ en@@ at ( some were severe and required a hospital rate ) .
the doctor should therefore indicate attention to all the signs and symptoms that may be noted on possible vulner@@ able reactions such as dy@@ es ag@@ ie , pain at the swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ inal pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ed so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and advise medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe skin @-@ ha@@ ired side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the onset of symptoms that may point to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all doses of dos@@ ing will be transmitted to the patient and be understood from the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was found , some severe suffering and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a were rarely reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pine , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy is predominantly administered intraven@@ ously .
there are no data available to indicate whether the termination of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a pine surgical procedure which reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the pine .
clinical assessment due to the treated doctor is significant for therapy planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be informed that when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet will take up the tablet to the next morning , after seeing their failure .
they are supposed to take no two tablets per week , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned for the planned weekly day .
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients have to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ en@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see section 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interventions were not performed , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually contam@@ inated medicines , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore , neither during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ en@@ at allow no indication to identify directly in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

in oste@@ opor@@ osis of oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily ) resulted in no clinical significance of the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( an increase in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ en@@ at is temporarily distributed to intraven@@ ous injection of 1 mg / kg temporarily , but then quickly distributed in the bones or in the urine .
after the intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at about 50 % of the radioactive substance were eliminated in 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .

only doctors who are familiar with the immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transp@@ lan@@ ts , this medication should be contrac@@ ted or changes in the immune soup therapy .
due to clinical relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can lead to transpl@@ ant shock or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ missions or immun@@ o soup .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage should be kept only under the tigh@@ tening control of one in the transpl@@ antation of an experienced medical device ( see section 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dos@@ ing adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the adv@@ ancing of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be primarily based on clinical assessment of shock and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; recommendations
after changing from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror should be controlled before conversion and over two weeks after changing .
in day 4 , systemic exposure was measured as Tal@@ mud , with both formulation and both kidney transpl@@ ant patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror , recommended during the first two weeks after gra@@ ft transpl@@ antation , to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transpl@@ ant phase .

kidney and liver transpl@@ ant after a conversion from other immune supp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once daily needs the treatment with the recommended initi@@ ation dose for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transp@@ lan@@ ts .
cardi@@ ac transpl@@ ant for adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f is an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day each day .
other transpl@@ ant cat@@ chers are not a clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f at lung cancer , pancre@@ as and subsequent patients , in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for application .
dose adap@@ t@@ ations in special patient groups patient with reduced liver function to maintain blood concentrations in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with serious liver disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function , Da kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose of dose is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of tac@@ tile function , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum concentration , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ct content and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ tile @-@ based therapy is required ( see section 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley mirror in full blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of shock and toler@@ ability in individual case of im@@ pregn@@ ation of full blood @-@ tac@@ tile tac@@ tile @-@ level insp@@ ections .
it is recommended common controls of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood Tal@@ mud mirror from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after changing from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustment , changes of the immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ tile concentrations of blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible , if the valley level is not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blood in the first time according to liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and the patient &apos;s heart transpl@@ ant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac gra@@ fts were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transp@@ lan@@ ders or other side effects , which can appear in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ dering the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ m@@ esh@@ ly control of a medical device ( see section 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ fts from transpl@@ ant reactions , which proved to be treated opposite other immune supp@@ ress@@ ors , are still no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ation formulation .
to proph@@ yla@@ xis of transp@@ lan@@ ts of gra@@ fts for adults and gra@@ fts in childhood , no clinical data are yet no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ation formulation .
due to possible inter@@ actions , which can lead to a her@@ ni@@ fication of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to avoid or other plant @-@ enh@@ elling during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ phs ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ tile concentrations in the blood is provided , because the tac@@ tile blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances .
in rare cases referred to as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ troph@@ ic was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ phs .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid over@@ load and oil .
as with other immune supp@@ ression , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or use of solar control with a high protection factor .
if patients who take the tac@@ tile , symptoms for pre@@ s such as headache , loss of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and bl@@ ur@@ red vision should indicate a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .

simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medic@@ inal products which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels while the same gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the tac@@ tile dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see section 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

adv@@ ances is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , related blood cl@@ ots ) .
dosage and frequency of the application addressed , if Adv@@ ise is used for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age in surgical intervention .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack , which causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in the joints , muscles , or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method used as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell that was associated to a gene ( DNA ) which enabled them to make the formation of the human body factor VIII .
adv@@ ances is another drugs approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is otherwise stated that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was investigated by preventing blood tests as well as surgical intervention .
in the main study the efficacy of adv@@ an@@ cies in the prevention of blood tests in 86 % of 510 new blood pressure is awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ate ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ances must not be used in patients who possibly are ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against the human form factor VIII , mouse , or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to provide a approval for placing Adv@@ ance in the European Union .
dosage : dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma concentration ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during treatment , the recommended dose and frequency of injec@@ tions must be appropriate to determine the factor VIII @-@ plasma seal .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII per kilogram of body weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to as@@ sign an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the administration speed should be set after the patient &apos;s request , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of VIII directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to a factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position days at the largest and other factors depend on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 re@@ positioning and an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , re@@ acting from ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women over the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding no experiences .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have previously untreated patients who have previously untreated inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 1000 up to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) calculated . b ) The unexpected tr@@ ash of the blood cl@@ ots factor VIII @-@ mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots was maintained throughout the period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on 15 post@@ oper@@ atively .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low incidence of inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , there was none of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed severe until moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure compared to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) of an VIII inhibit@@ or .
in the previously untreated clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE disease inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients to traces of contam@@ inated proteins were analysed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell@@ ist , otherwise no signs or symptoms occur on an allergic reaction to an allergic reaction .
in four patients the occurr@@ ence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pom@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ocy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE have been reported on the allergic reactions from allergic type , including an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII appears as a C@@ of@@ actor for the activated factor IX , and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X to factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data approval from the CH@@ MP , CH@@ MP has still considered a positive rating , but in consideration that safety profile can be closely supervised by the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP has based on the basis of the security process of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ Rs every 6 months , decided to apply further extension procedures in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited has officially distributed the Committee for Human@@ itarian Affairs Committee ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has re@@ covering its proposal to auth@@ orization Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the crossover components ( tissues , the other structures in the body combines , surro@@ unds and relies on ) .
this is a type of virus that genetically modified genetically so that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has changed so that there is no copies of themselves and no infections can trigger in humans .
adv@@ ances would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and to make the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced by the non defect in the human body is formed by p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the rest@@ oring DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the canc@@ erous cells can grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of the sub@@ jection , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the answer of the company , some questions were un@@ explained .
based on the inspection of the initially submitted documents , CH@@ MP has compiled a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP opinion has not been verified that injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours takes benefits for patients .
the committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of medication in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proved that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in reliable ways , and that there is neither for the environment even for people who come in touch with the patients that is harmful .
the company won &apos;t know the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by an allergy against p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ d@@ skin irrit@@ ation ( clo@@ g@@ ged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and finished once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ g@@ ged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug may be able to stop con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measurements were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ py symptoms that were reported from the patient before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in observation of all hypo@@ cris@@ p symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported patients who have Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze income , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who were suffering from pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a has been viewed , the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who had Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , oral mal@@ ign@@ ity , dizziness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity , an@@ em@@ ulation , headache , ti@@ redness , in@@ som@@ nia ( insom@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aero@@ bic may not be used in patients who may not be prescribed ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ r@@ ener@@ ated active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for treating allergi@@ es ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients that suffer from a bott@@ om@@ ous glaucoma ( hypertension ) , heart disease or v@@ ascular disease including hypertension ( hypertension ) or already a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to provide an approval for the distribution of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush , break or chew@@ ing ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied for children under 12 years due to the error of data on the un@@ question@@ able and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after separation of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can take the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in at the time .
after decl@@ ining the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a mono@@ cl@@ ine .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine also contains contra@@ indications in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ sine , per@@ go@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ in , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective , and the data are not enough to address relevant recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data are not enough to address relevant recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment with the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ ton@@ ic or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ wheel or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache , or gain of heada@@ ches ) must be removed .
in the treatment of following patient groups , patients suffering from cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ orous , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder infections or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the history of the patient .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ amin@@ ants prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce or in their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who were administered in ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
there were no significant differences between the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests could be detected between the patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the disaster has not been identified , so that interaction with other drugs cannot be excluded .

the in@@ conc@@ ision of the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison with the frequency of normal population .
as a reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted on human beings and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ction properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in should not be applied in the pregnancy .
the patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that it may occur in very rare cases in a benchmark , that can cause a impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sea@@ weed , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ ars ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , Con@@ vul@@ sions ) .

a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is especially likely , as well as at@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( oral @-@ drying , p@@ up@@ ill@@ enst@@ ar@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the inhibit@@ ing of rele@@ asing cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Mast@@ cells / Bas@@ oph@@ il@@ en as well as the inhibit@@ ing of expression of the adhes@@ ion &apos;s P @-@ sel@@ ess to endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective slaughter , or the tasks that are connected to the flies .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in at the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ wheel or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
it took part 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ agon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total co@@ res for the symp@@ tom ( except nose loops ) , significantly higher than mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the weak@@ ening effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ til@@ isation , was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the f@@ low@@ balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ ing study , which was carried out with the formulation of healthy adult subjects was found that four volunteers Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin badly ver@@ sely toler@@ ated .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) from pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in , after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in , was the exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , for com@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity , however , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may have no special dangers for human beings .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the effects were generally associated with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in reprodu@@ cible clinical studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 the application of the Pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ amin@@ ants contribute to the allergic symptoms by preventing them that hist@@ amine , a body @-@ own substance , can produce its effect .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets left symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) , such as Ni@@ esen , running or ju@@ diced nose and drow@@ ning eyes at the same time con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by using the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
there were further studies presented to prove that the body uses the syrup , the solution for inser@@ tion and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children un@@ question@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two weeks treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us had received an average decrease of symptoms of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease from 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of the symptoms were compared to six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who possibly are ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe to provide auth@@ orization to the public transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease and can be taken after the closing of the symptoms and resum@@ ed with their re @-@ occur .
during persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended in the patient during the allergi@@ es time .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been given ( see below 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , NSC eri@@ us and alcohol is not reinforced with the performance reduction of alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
the patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that it may occur in very rare cases , that can lead to impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common side effects , which was reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and heada@@ ches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect of heada@@ ches were treated with 5.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and at 6.9 % of the patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study administered up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of rele@@ asing cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Mast@@ cells / Bas@@ oph@@ il@@ en as well as the inhibit@@ ing of expression of the adhes@@ ion &apos;s P @-@ sel@@ ess to endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al@@ cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ous effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ stly of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in a single dos@@ ing study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective slaugh@@ tering or the tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the symptoms of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ently allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the total co@@ res of the cargo of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreased the load by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investigating for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology has been de@@ emed in the different forms , and chronic patients can be easily recruited .
since the history of amin@@ ant is an urs@@ or factor in all ur@@ tic diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is expected to improve in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dose intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amin@@ ants in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not re@@ acted to Anti@@ hist@@ amine , was excluded from the study .
improvement of youth up more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients who treated patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , in 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
there are no reference points for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the disaster has not been identified , however , that interaction with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor any inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( fet@@ al rich , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) does not apply to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical studies presented with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin conducted in clinical trials , with a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quant@@ it@@ ative differences of the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on the conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and reprodu@@ cible x@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may have no special dangers for human beings .

the in@@ descri@@ b@@ able doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see below 4.4 ) and that no data are available , which support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
for about 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 , metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ella is restricted and experienced a higher sub@@ st@@ ance load ( see under Section 5.2 ) .
the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years of age which metabolic metabolic is identical with the children who metabolic normally .

in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not reinforced with the performance reduction of alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
the overall stability of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the placebo group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , who were administered up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
children aged 1 to 11 , who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ous effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
clinical trials was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
a single @-@ day dose of 7,5 mg performed A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or technology .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was neither the simultaneous taking of alcohol neither to a gain of alcohol induc@@ ing performance even to an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and young patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the symptoms of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the total co@@ res of the cargo of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decreased , effectively the allergic allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dose intervals .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Caucas@@ ia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic multi @-@ dose study with si@@ eving form@@ ulations on children aged between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which metabolic metabolic disorders .
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ x higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max . 3 to 4 times higher with a season of half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no reference points for a clin@@ ically relevant drug p@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially announced on the Committee for Human@@ itarian Affairs Committee ( CH@@ MP ) that the company receives its proposal on approval for the prevention of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ an H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and elderly people to protect the flu caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a strain of influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus , which can easily spread to humans , because humans still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
in this way , the immune system is able to form an influenza virus in a contact with a influenza virus .
subsequently , the virus man@@ ure of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a body @-@ alien@@ ated ) , cleaned and used as a part of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites demonstrated that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this led to the extent of the clinical data base for the assessment of safety of the vaccine , in order to meet the requirements of the guidelines on the EMEA for pre@@ pan@@ dem@@ ical vacc@@ ines .
if you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can do not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for entry , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , because the security of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be contrac@@ ted when the physician has checked out which an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient had previously taken , and the probability has judged that the virus is applied to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines are taken .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is aimed at the body weight .
aging in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV amount in the blood and holding them at a low level .
AIDS is not to heal but can cause damage to the immune system and so that the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases can also be delayed .
A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously untreated prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the pharmac@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ zo@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had taken previously prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
main indi@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who previously had not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under Placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but with the children that had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few to the treatment .
in the study involving adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the vir@@ us@@ load increased the viral load after 16 @-@ weeks treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came to a more powerful waste of the vir@@ us@@ load after four weeks in the patient who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarrhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vomiting , rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients , which may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r or one of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase can also not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are the same as A@@ gener@@ ase , and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as in other medicines for HIV consists of patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( dying of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection that are caused by rest@@ oring the immune system ) .
the Commission &apos;s Human@@ itarian Association ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicine used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ ic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not detected .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the approval of scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to provide an approval for the market launch of A@@ gener@@ ase in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicine for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
for usually , A@@ zo@@ ase capsules are to be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ ic Boo@@ bs of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution for entry is 14 % less than one of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , ag@@ rams capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the reinforced addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ bs ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ zo@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicine up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for the use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ zo@@ ase capsules in adult patients with medium @-@ heavier liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with serious liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application is expected to be treated with a lighter or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , which contain Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , may not be used due to the risk of reducing plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r during the in@@ gest@@ ion of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy did not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of a HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually A@@ zo@@ ase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , increased risk for heavy liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chron@@ ically active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which is not recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment including morph@@ ological effects , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the tri@@ ni@@ otic function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended for simultaneous risk of my@@ op@@ ath including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Agency ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma concentration of am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic inter@@ actions with am@@ b@@ vi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a may be altered , however , the information cannot be sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on the o@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ tion symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high propaganda content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
a@@ gener@@ ase should be removed for duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported via the onset of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of existing diabetes mell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other illnesses caused by their therapy , which are associated with the development of a type of diabetes mell@@ itus , or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the metabolic disorders associated with metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous melan@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune disease , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ oh@@ em@@ esis , higher body mass index ) , were reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with minor therapeutic effect can not be used simultaneously with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with minor therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines whose ingredients are mainly associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to increased plasma concentration with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can cause a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and cause resistance to resistance .
in the attempt to balance the stress concentrations of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already en@@ cro@@ uch , the am@@ bu@@ il levels are , and , if possible to check the viral load and add the cur@@ d .
a dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see also E@@ moti@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % is increased for up to 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to illustr@@ ate the effectiveness and integrity of this treatment schem@@ atics .
52 % hum@@ ili@@ ated if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved during the combination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg per day ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a eng@@ m@@ esh@@ y monitoring , because the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ able of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ icide component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase will lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) do not require dose to dose .
the treatment with E@@ stim@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin probably reduces the serum concentration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r .
if this medication should be used simultaneously , caution , because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
when this medicine is applied together , caution is required ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be carried out , as an exact forecast of the effect of combination of am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thus to a rise in associated side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ c@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dose of ri@@ c@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin is not performed , however , the plasma concentration of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of t@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 replies ) to 2,@@ 69@@ fold in comparison to the value which was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below are also sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ zo@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
the patients therefore should therefore be connected to toxic reactions associated with these drugs , if they are applied in combination with A@@ zo@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can &apos;t be taken at the same time as A@@ zo@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ ban@@ ces .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower level of plasma concentration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Ro@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ ni@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 by Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration and increases with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ ics , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % conden@@ sing interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic cogn@@ itive effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , their metabolism is strongly dependent of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinct to expect the plasma concentration in simultaneous handling of A@@ gener@@ ase .
because plasma increases of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including one R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug is not recommended with am@@ b@@ vi@@ r .
it is recommended a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as well as stabi@@ lization of the mirror , since the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same time of am@@ bu@@ vi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral tot@@ em Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al ten@@ ol@@ am caution is required .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible rise of the plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 to 4 @-@ f@@ ou@@ ache .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on the o@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ary symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the very low reliability of historical compar@@ ability , currently no recommendation can be given , like the am@@ b@@ az@@ r dose is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ran@@ atio ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption prevention is recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the simultaneous gift of ad@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk @-@ activated rats , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r over@@ passes people into the breast milk .
a reproduction study of perc@@ ep@@ tive rats which was administered by the income in u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the breast@@ feeding period .
the further development of post@@ nat@@ ity including fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ tier .
the in@@ conc@@ essi@@ bility of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the A@@ gener@@ ase @-@ associated side effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early in early , and rarely resulted in treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the under@@ under@@ age .
most of the above adverse events are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg a@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
oc@@ curren@@ ces ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were identified as indicated in connection with study medication , and more than 1 % of patients were performed as well as under the treatment of laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with HIV patients ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and mal@@ ign@@ ant fat tissue , increasing in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ous and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ troph@@ ie of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat collection ( bull ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ tively known individuals who had been treated with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a median duration of 36 weeks , was observed only a case ( bull ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ G in 245 patients ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is over a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin suggestions were usually slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ aneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ b@@ vi@@ r had to be broken .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose cases were particularly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune disease , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .

the link between the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 Rep@@ lication involving human beings is not yet defined .
with the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ tively previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - such as other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r p@@ oo@@ ed treatment schem@@ as demonstrated - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ tively , patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ sil@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred until week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ic could be studied .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not pre @-@ treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those with adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ sil@@ avi@@ r twice daily , n = 107 ) participated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ative systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors isol@@ ates .
the present ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resist@@ ence than the presence of mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 8@@ 2a , V@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2a , V@@ 8@@ 2A and L@@ 90@@ M , with a reduced advantage of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations are subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended , always the current inter@@ pret@@ ative systems to analyse the results of resistance tests .
in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance systems based analyses based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ative systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors isol@@ ates .
companies , testing the diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ ph@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cruci@@ fix@@ ion against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data to cross resistance between am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ sil@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ tively , a limited cross @-@ resistant resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , mon@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ins@@ ulated isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early demol@@ ition of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can affect the subsequent treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on four gener@@ ase ( 600 mg twice daily ) together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ y ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily associated with do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub@@ sid@@ y of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in relation to the time adjusted average changes from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma @-@ load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ approved shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , 152 of which were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was assessed and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) along with A@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients in the study included plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Bas@@ ically on these data should be considered to be expected with PI pre @-@ treated children of expected gain of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration , the medium length ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % is increased for up to 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered along with Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
hence the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can conclude on a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration capacity of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation in the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the drug in plasma , with the amount of untreated am@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , which represents the active proportion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of untreated am@@ b@@ abo@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredients in the met@@ ady concentration in the Ste@@ ady State is dependent on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore we have to display the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with caution when they are given at the same time using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily ambul@@ ance exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ zo@@ ase are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar .
the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a kidney @-@ function may be low on elimination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ b@@ abo@@ r plasma plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome with doses to which the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , said .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , some evidence for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gene tests , the bacterial reverse test tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro @-@ core test in rats and chromosome test test to human periph@@ eral ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes was am@@ eli@@ vi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , clinical studies have no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase even after the end of treatment .
studies for tox@@ icity in young men , who were treated with an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate , both at the age of 4 and with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r animals .
in a systemic plasma position , significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ eton changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the reinforced addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ bs ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ zo@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicine up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application is expected to be treated with low or lighter liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or threatening effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Agency ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed up to 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can cause a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and cause resistance to resistance .
508 % is increased for up to 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .

a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a eng@@ m@@ esh@@ y monitoring , because the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ able of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ stim@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be lower .
when this medicine is applied together , caution is required ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be carried out , as an exact forecast of the effect of combination of am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ c@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dose of ri@@ c@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are available .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Ro@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ ni@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ b@@ vi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % conden@@ sing interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ran@@ atio ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used only after careful breakdown of possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a reproduction study of perc@@ ep@@ tive rats which was administered by the income in u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the breast@@ feeding period .
the in@@ conc@@ essi@@ bility of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of a super@@ do@@ ation , the patient is to observe signs of an In@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both on acute and chronic ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm with acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0,@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ins@@ ulated isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the therapy optim@@ isation should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected gain of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of untreated am@@ b@@ abo@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredients in the met@@ ady concentration in the Ste@@ ady State is dependent on the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ...
therefore we have to display the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with caution when they are given at the same time using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney disorder is likely to be low on elimination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the benefits of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution was not affected either with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution for entry is 14 % less than one of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , ag@@ rams capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be able once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the in@@ gest@@ ion of the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicine up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there must be no Dos@@ age recommendation for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for entry and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination of these patient groups can be avoided .
although a dose adap@@ tion is not necessary for am@@ b@@ vi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a consequence of high propaganda content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution for infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may result in a liter@@ al in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this medicine and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening effects like cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy did not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk 47 of a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Agency ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to duration when a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug - 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous melan@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sen .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can cause a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and cause resistance to resistance .
508 % is increased for up to 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration and associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ apes , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .

in clinical trials for the analysis of the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment or in the surrounding area .
a unique unique oral absorption of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which is equivalent to the content of approximately 16 bags , could cause nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized itself after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es were detected after the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 appro@@ vals of the relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete balance of h@@ ubs at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior to 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
in 60 % of the total of 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients with breast cancer the f@@ eig@@ ns were completely destroyed ; this was the case of 20 % of the 105 with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) .
a complete press release could be reached at 23 % from 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five @-@ time application a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled study study after four years of this data show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; were treated clin@@ ically and that remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment classes of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ tested clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , dis@@ crete , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ troph@@ ic acc@@ ents within an inter@@ related 25 c@@ m2 of large treatment area on the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or in the face .
two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ational rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) in two combined observation studies after one or two treatment periods .
approved indications of utter@@ most indications , ap@@ tic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients usually not up and were therefore not studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Con@@ tag@@ i@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies with the doses of ≤ 16 weeks ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks .
a minimal systemic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od spread through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0,1 , 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml in the application of the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ value time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study , which indicates an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute corne@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study for the paint tox@@ icity at the rat no doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg were significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out for four months to paint any similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at the age of three days per week induced no tum@@ ors at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and not dirty , is a risk for people due to the systemic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors were treated in mice that was treated with the real @-@ free cream , formerly and in a larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzymes in patients with verified diagnosis of a Mu@@ c@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that do not appear with brain or ner@@ ves in connection ) .
this means certain substances ( Gly@@ kos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) are not min@@ ed and therefore accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following not neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , movements , reduce lung capacity , cardi@@ ac disease and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should be done in a hospital or a clinic with re@@ vit@@ alisation , and the patients need appropriate drugs to prevent allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( by reducing its effect in relation to reducing the g@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms lowered the g@@ ag concentrations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , arth@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion point .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied in patients who may not react strongly ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will update every year all new information that may be announced , and to update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms will receive patients who are preserved Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission awarded the G@@ enzyme Europe B.@@ V. , a approval for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using ch@@ o @-@ mammals ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is to treat patients with verified diagnosis of a Mu@@ c@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can increase if the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms treated patients can develop in@@ fusion reactions , which are defined as any of the side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or by the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be supervised , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be made in an adequate clinical environment , where re@@ vit@@ alisation facilities available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected to form nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with caution ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
because of course , there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer breaks , the risk provision@@ ing has to be c@@ auti@@ ous because of the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti @-@ locking ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate , which the reaction has occurred .
in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( Anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies are not shown on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated opposite Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk is recommended , is not recommended during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side effects in clinical trials were primarily classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) were observed .
undes@@ irable drug inter@@ actions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were observed during the phase 3 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are common in the following table following the following sorts : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and lungs in the history , too , heavy reactions occurred , including Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory failure and facial expressions ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5 , with mainly severe displacement and treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , it came to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , with a severe delay form mostly within one month ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) were found in 13 / 45 patients no by radio@@ immun@@ o@@ bur@@ zip@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients with which it never came to ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version .
patients with lack of low anti @-@ physical levels are a robust reduction in the g@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody tit@@ res , a variable reduction of g@@ ag at Har@@ n was found .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal up to low neutr@@ alising material effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies appeared not in connection with the incidence of undes@@ ired medicine actions , even when the occurr@@ ence of undes@@ ired drug reactions typically fell along with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for the enzyme @-@ sales therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative sub@@ strate and preventing a further accumulation of enzymes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and cells into the ly@@ n@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were randomised in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients were recorded , the majority of patients from the Middle phen@@ otype , and only one patient proved the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had a for@@ c@@ ased exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 metres .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where she received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared to the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the in@@ ability to be shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of this effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period , and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportional to the body size growing children .
of the 26 patients with a Hep@@ atomic fact , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear tr@@ ash of the g@@ ag @-@ mirror was found in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) that remained constant until the end of the study .
in regard to the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who has been reflected by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes of the shoulder @-@ bearing ( TR@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it was conducted an open @-@ year phase 2 study carried out primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe breast form and 4 with medium @-@ form form ) .
in four patients the dose of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size reduction ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z score for these age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium @-@ run form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe displacement form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , whereas in the older patients with severe displacement form only limited or no progress made in the cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study tests on the co@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma dos@@ ing schem@@ atics were performed on the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent the difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proved that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ atics is equivalent to .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate all new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the product features will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to elderly and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( a different medicines for cancer ) in patients who still have no chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( v@@ icious - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and spread themselves easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who had not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who had previously received other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists earlier than some therapy .
to reduce side effects , the patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( vitamin C ) and folic acid obtained by vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should be given before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition to an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid man@@ gel ) .
in patients whose blood picture changes , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be lowered , set or reduced the dose .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is easier to out@@ fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations in the active form of the drug and a longer term effect in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study to 4@@ 56 patients who had not yet received chemotherapy against their disease before .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different medicines against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , and both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , survived on average 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with which cancer did not attack cell epithel@@ ium cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta in longer survival compared to the comparable medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. , an approval for the market launch of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each flow bottle has to be checked with 4.2 ml 0,9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of essential oil sis is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .

the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 days treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day every 21 days treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
a reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin actions must be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid are given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dosage as well as according to any third application cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should be created before each gift a complete blood picture should be created , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a thro@@ cy@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine sy@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination will take place under the ad@@ ditions of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the instructions in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mono@@ therapies or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria conform to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 ° 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when patients after 2 dose @-@ reduction tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continue with the appearance of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over , compared to patients aged 65 years , an elevated side effect is increased .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for the use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for integrity and effectiveness .
in clinical studies , patients with a cancer @-@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose of dose necessary to go beyond the recommended dose adjustment for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cancer @-@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a limitation of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or tran@@ si@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ ue values &gt; the 3.0 times of the upper limit value ( at intervals of liver metast@@ asis ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ asis ) are not specifically examined in studies .
patients must not be monitored in terms of the bone @-@ market soup and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ron number has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mb@@ als once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neutr@@ ality number , thro@@ cy@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
less tox@@ icity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ otic tox@@ icity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neutr@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia , if a pre@@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients need to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure of reducing tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous in@@ fusion of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ ors ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients receiving treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with which these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , existing blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation of trans@@ cellular space in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergonom@@ ics shall be considered in front of the p@@ em@@ et@@ ric treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible skull , men should be pointed out in front of treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted to take advice on the sperm account .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid antibodies ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed training with the result of a prolifer@@ ation of side effects .
therefore , be careful when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ ally , 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding inter@@ shareholders with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long semi @-@ value as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the same application must be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ last@@ y chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alization ratio ) , when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed at pregnant women , but like an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected in pregnancy in pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful breakdown of usage for the mother and the risk of the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of reproductive ability , men should be pointed out before the course of the treatment , advice on the sperm count .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in breast milk can not be excluded and un@@ wanted effects in the gest@@ ures of infants can not be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received treatment arm in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement of clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ an@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms are characterized by an improvement of lung function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the time of the control system .
a multic@@ entr@@ e , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA with patients with locally advanced or metastatic NS@@ CL@@ C in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NS@@ CL@@ C were treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( int@@ ents to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el @-@ treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on the overall survival was to benefit from AL@@ IM@@ TA with NS@@ CL@@ C with a predominantly non @-@ disk epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.00 , p = 0,0@@ 47 ) , customized HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 months .

it is used in overweight adults with a body massage index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fet@@ ish@@ du@@ ed nutrition .
patients receiving all@@ i are taking no weight loss after 12 weeks , should apply to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , they can not build some fats in the food , thereby resulting in a quarter of the fats of unle@@ ashed fats un@@ d@@ aut the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 , with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , all@@ i 60 mg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking a placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no one could be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .

in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to provide approval for the distribution of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical and fet@@ al nutrition .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is no sufficient data to ensure efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ously , elderly and / or kidney function is not necessary in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .

the probability of the occurr@@ ence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat range of low @-@ fat and low @-@ fat diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can occur with improved metabolic control , patients who may take a medicine against diabetes before beginning of a therapy with all@@ i to consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic drug may be adapted .
patients , all@@ i , as well as medicines for hypertension or increased cholesterol levels , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dose must be adapted to this medicine .
it is recommended to meet additional energetic interventions in order to prevent the oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive failure in the case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study of interaction of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a lowering of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma concentration .
the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at could be influenced by the Quick values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta @-@ car@@ otene .
however , patients should be recommended to take a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vit@@ amine intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a disposable dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time was observed , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the medicine together , since absorption of infected fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the skins are often defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of those who were detected after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of certain size .
+ It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to def@@ lection in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects , without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ excess cases , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on an investigation on human and animal may be derived from a fast recovery , systemic effects that are due to the li@@ pas@@ ch inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at .

two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical and fet@@ ch diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of the boundary ) , has been rated as follows : as change of body weight in the course ( Table 1 ) and the proportion of people who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of its initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed for 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the total chol@@ est@@ ess was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists , the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy , and 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the distribution of Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to a cancer disease and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting , induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding one before the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colo@@ rec@@ tal , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection can be monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 anti @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is provided with the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or that tend to be an extension .
except in connection with another chem@@ o@@ therapist , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used for treating nausea and vomiting in the days following the chemotherapy treatment .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hib@@ ited the activity of the five examined Chem@@ otherapy activity ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ abine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ static met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Chin@@ id@@ ine , Ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ r@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ions are not necessary , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women , unless it is necessary to treat the treatment doctor .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , heada@@ ches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of survival reactions and reactions at the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar properties of adverse events were found as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; no dose @-@ response relationships were observed .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis trials carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy at a al@@ xi@@ - over@@ turn .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , and 250 mg / m2 D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g / m2 D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g / m2 D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) received , which was given to Day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60@@ mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were treated with patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were assigned to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron owns the ability to block the I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ els and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ els and extend the duration of the shareholder .
the objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. affected Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption According to an initial decrease in Plas@@ ma@@ konzentr@@ ations follow a slow elimination of plasma concentrations from the body with an average termin@@ ale half of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tionally in the total dose of 0,@@ 3- 90 m / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous pall@@ ets of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average median ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % .
out of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations goes out that at once daily intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , the C@@ max was up to 0.@@ 75 mg higher after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration ; however , the C@@ max was 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys , and about another 50 % are transformed into two primary metabolism , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron above less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
Eli@@ min@@ ation After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dose .
according to a unique intraven@@ ous bolt , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function problems , the termin@@ ale of elimination of elimination time and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction in dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , only after ex@@ positions were observed , which are considered adequate over the maximum of human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 from pre @-@ clinical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als , which can be involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can extend the shareholders of shareholders .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose correspon@@ ded in approximately the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure when people ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( in thy@@ roid gland , hyp@@ ophy@@ sis , pancre@@ as , tri@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors at rats , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses of dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results will be low for humans .
the holder of this approval for the market will need to inform the European Commission for placing on the placing of this decision in the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Pap@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C has been recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection @-@ solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should be res@@ emble a biological medicine called R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A with the same en@@ vir@@ ally effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon was to be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) Hepatitis C ( one through viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic study the liver tissue damage damage , and the values of the liver enzymes Al@@ an@@ de@@ amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been incorporated , which stim@@ ulates this to the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon placed data that prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of pharmac@@ euticals , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference training .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was applied to the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business affairs . what were the biggest concern that the CH@@ MP comments on the recommendation to be sent to the interest ?
moreover , concerns have been expressed concern that data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the marketing of the drug .
the number of patients with hepatitis C which spoke on the treatment with Alph@@ eon and R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon fl@@ amed the disease in more patients than the reference drug ; Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from being used in the study , the drug exam@@ ines an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cruci@@ fix@@ ation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or Schn@@ it@@ tw@@ unden ) , strain and ten@@ sion@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ clo@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , which were det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resi@@ sten@@ te St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go is not effective against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and draw alternative treatments .
it works through blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , where proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its growth of bacteria .
main indic@@ ative of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was rejected by the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of the 71 patients receiving placebo said to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ inkle , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in had similar contacts : when the results of both studies were merged in Hau@@ tw@@ inkle , about 90 % of the patients were enrolled in the treatment .
in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ans ( eit@@ ful cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections that were det@@ ectable or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the customer &apos;s office .
the Committee of Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ time treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections regarding the risks of superf@@ icial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , depreciation or se@@ per@@ ate wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the market launch of Al@@ tar@@ go in the European Union .
the patients , where within two to three days no improvement is shown , should be examined once again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ isation or heavy local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is to be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment will be carefully checked and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections such as Er@@ re@@ ger is known or susp@@ ects ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials with secondary open wounds was the effectiveness of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections that caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , in@@ sufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which have been reached in people after top@@ ical application to top@@ ical skin , or infected superf@@ icial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral care of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be on the poor skin of healthy adult men around 81 % .
due to the low system exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ iz@@ ations are not required to be required if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the f@@ lex@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systemic antibiot@@ ic .
in case of decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go is continued , is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of al@@ clo@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections that have been applied to Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect of irrit@@ ation on the administration site , which consider about 1 % of the patients .
mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of p@@ ant@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ opil@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a particular binding of the 50s lower unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the obligations of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ mitt@@ ent anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the Bin@@ der Bank is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 and is located in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ral centre .
by binding on this binding point , P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhibit@@ ing the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
if the use of the local prevalence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should appear , an advice should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was put 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sample removal was carried out in days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the median and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systematic recording of people according to top@@ ical use of 1 % Sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
metabolism in vitro oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en has been communic@@ ated primarily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under minor participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in vitro review on genetic mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats @-@ micro @-@ test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither in male still with female rats signs of reduced fer@@ til@@ arity with oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest estimated exposure of people ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) has been eliminated .
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study of rats were ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development of development ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and maternal tox@@ icity .

Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two doses of existing vacc@@ inations , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix only may be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , that consists of two doses taken to an end to the end .
if a rel@@ ing dose against hepatitis A or B is requested , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine will be given .
vacc@@ ines seem to teach by the immune system ( the body defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can resist a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and the Twin@@ rix children registered since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used for protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered in the context of one from three doses of existing vacc@@ ines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indic@@ ative for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last injection of a protective antibody concentration .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
ambient resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop anti @-@ physical concentration against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that ambient temperature was similar to ambient and a 12 @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , appetite , pain at the injec@@ tor , redness , mat@@ iness ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix may not be applied to the active ingredients ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the Company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . a permit for the distribution of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic dos@@ ing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , with the first dose of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refresh@@ ment is requested for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , the vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis B virus observed in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured whether immun@@ os@@ ities , which have addressed to a hepatitis A vaccination , possibly require a refresh@@ er than protection since it may also be protected by immun@@ ologic memory .
3 As with all injec@@ tions vacc@@ ines should be available for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation valve is recommended that the 360 ELISA unit form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen contains .
with hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis patient and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces in the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody value is achieved , so in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ inations can be required .
since a intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal vaccination , this injection should be avoided .
in case of thro@@ cy@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix cannot be inj@@ ected as an exception in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus and ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ ps vaccine was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ ochem@@ ical therapy or patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency disease , it may be assumed that no sufficient immun@@ o@@ deficiency may be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination boxes of this formulation , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ itis , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ines .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 - including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of ambient rix were compared to the 3 @-@ dos@@ ing combination of combination .
only exceptions were the higher Frequ@@ ency of Pain and Mat@@ ern@@ ity on a calculation base per vaccination : Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed according to the gift of Ambi@@ rix with 5@@ 9.1 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans .
according to the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects that Ambi@@ rix were given , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose pl@@ anting material .
however , the frequency of mat@@ th@@ fulness was comparable high ( i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received ambient rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination stock@@ ings ) .
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ able pain and mat@@ eness was low and comparable to the combination of the combination of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses oc@@ sch@@ ema .
in a comparison study of 1- up to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general strikes in the Ambi@@ ent group was comparable to the hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was observed .
in the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per band .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines which schem@@ ati@@ fied over heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ cans of vacc@@ inations with the combined hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment was statistically significant .
in clinical trials which were carried out at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 months old dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined cycle with three doses .
at 289 individuals whose immun@@ ity was pay@@ able , the op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in table below ) were significantly higher compared with Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ material significantly higher than Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical comparison study group 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds each month after the ending of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans vaccination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
for people who were at the time of the Grun@@ er Peri@@ od between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies were detected for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months in@@ clin@@ sch@@ ema .
the immune response was comparable to both anti@@ gens against both anti@@ gens comparable to the vaccine production of 3 doses , consisting of 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study near 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies were comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months of vaccination .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix is administered at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus and 8 shar@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mask @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is both prior to examine and / or physical visible changes in both cases and / or physically visible changes .

you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
like all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix not completely protect against infection with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child in front of both vacc@@ inations Ambi@@ rix already infected with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) a vaccination may not prevent any disease .
a protection against other infections that cause liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can &apos;t be medi@@ ated .
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can cause asthma attacks , breathing need or swelling of your face or tongue . • If with you / your child once an allergic reaction has occurred to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly create a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the conventi@@ ons of the second vaccination up@@ take ) .
in a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it is recommended to give you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content in an in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens .
the second vaccination up@@ take of this vaccine is usually administered a month after the first dose , and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before the termination of the vaccine production .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people who are inj@@ ected due to severe blood cl@@ ots , suffer from skin and not in muscle tissue . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child may under@@ go a hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to the vaccination is needed .
21 Please note your doctor if you receive further medicine / take care ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) , or if you have been vacc@@ inated without ( antibodies ) / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given , or that is planned in the near future .
it can be , however , that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine , therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as different lim@@ bs .
when Ambi@@ rix is given to the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix s@@ ang@@ ing or lac@@ t@@ ating women is not given , except it is ur@@ gently needed to be vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you already showed an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages with 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs up to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since issu@@ ing the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP has shown that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambient rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix not only been placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medication is limited to the low patient position .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzymes or hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentration ) .
ammon@@ ium is divided - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed up , bl@@ ended under the food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ ke ( by the stomach @-@ ceiling in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nose probe ( caused by the nose into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , because Ammon@@ aps cannot be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do medicine that could be compared with active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also cause loss of appetite , an abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid disorders , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee of Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Ammon@@ aps in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle of high Ammon@@ ites are effective .
Ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the sel@@ ector of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information regarding this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme Q10 has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifested form ( in@@ complete enzymes manifest , which is manifested after the first life of life ) there is an indication of use when in the history of hyper@@ ammon@@ ite en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ low disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and development of the patient &apos;s necessary daily protein intake .
according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight over 20 kg , as well as with adolescents and adults .
patients who suffer from an early manifested deficiency of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a non @-@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ ase deficiency must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given patients with can@@ ary disorders , as a risk for orig@@ ination of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets are not immediately entered into the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ genital heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and ec@@ at@@ tainment of clinical conditions only with caution .
because met@@ abol@@ isation and separation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at is carried out via the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency only with external caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal deteri@@ oration and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a han@@ dicap of brain growth .
it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic was eliminated in human breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS entered at least 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ ired events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient who developed an metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ ac@@ ia tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of overdose resulted in a 5 @-@ month old little child with a special dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate , which showed intraven@@ ous dos@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity in a intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic is a metabolic active connection , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by acet@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic .
stur@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to remove excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram genom@@ ic sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the disease associated with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was formerly inf@@ lic@@ ally , and the disease induced himself with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free anal@@ ogs within the first life year of death .
by hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis , the uti@@ lization of alternative ways of nitrogen de@@ hydr@@ ate ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , proteins reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of neu@@ tered at post @-@ part@@ al ( but within the first life @-@ month ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and patients were treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ite en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many of mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifested form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) that were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ id@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ fish and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained according to a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in sober healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabolism was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous in sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lical disorders or hem@@ og@@ glo@@ opath@@ ies , according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at had no cla@@ vable effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children who are not able to swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ low disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ o or a nostr@@ ils .
according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight over 20 kg , as well as with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins should be kept within the normal area .
patients who suffer from an early manifested deficiency of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
when rat bur@@ gers were suspended before the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ( active met@@ abo@@ o of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyrami@@ ds cells of the brain .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient who developed an metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ ac@@ ia tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
stur@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to remove surplus excess
on the basis of tests on the excav@@ ation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces in the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of genom@@ ic sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
after a oral dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in Gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the completed product only for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at .
if a patient must have received the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at amounts to 5 grams in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they can not withdraw the nitrogen @-@ based waste products based on consumption of proteins in the body .
if there are laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding time , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to over@@ take the medicine into the breast milk and could harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste problems , distur@@ ban@@ ces of obe@@ dience , dis@@ ori@@ enti@@ ousness , memory problems , and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical states were observed .
if you find one of these symptoms , put yourself immediately with your doctor or with the not@@ ion of your hospital in conjunction with a corresponding treatment in connection .
if you forgot AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS taking the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes of blood cholesterol ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ cy@@ tes ) , reduction disorders , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , un@@ pleasant skin rash , rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the side effects you have significantly imp@@ acted or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this manual information .
you are allowed to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the box and refriger@@ ation after &quot; applicable up to &quot; specified exp@@ iry date .
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , and contents of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whit@@ ish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the emb@@ os@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If with you laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed in the same single doses or via a gast@@ ric f@@ ist@@ le ( hose which runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose , which is led by the nose into the stomach ) .

angi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different starch ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or E@@ KG ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients applied to a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow towards the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ ein or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , a different medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
during the PCI patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year in a total of just as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who have under@@ gone a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was equally effective as Hep@@ ine , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox must not be used in patients who possibly are sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other ingredients .
it must also be used in patients who had recently a bleeding , as well as people with heavy hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ p@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission awarded the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , a approval for the market launch of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ do ) when an emergency engagement or an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if in the second consecutive row a PCI is performed , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be included for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg will be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole bolt of angi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened at a maximum of 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be achieved .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully selected and administered rapidly intraven@@ ously before application .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fusion dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( if treated with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg can be pay@@ ed and tested the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which were included , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 . patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients is angi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be conducted 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous in un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ ar@@ ine or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
• more known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active substance or other components or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ dit@@ is . • heavier kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully tested in terms of symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI patients live among biop@@ sies in most cases of arter@@ ial points , patients who under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment in principle of bleeding everywhere .
in patients who are using war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) should be implemented in order to ensure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in will be achieved once again before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of blood .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in with thro@@ cy@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in any case regularly .
the animal experiments are in@@ adequate in terms of the impact on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , reduction or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in group and patients who were treated with Hep@@ p@@ arin was more common in women and patients over 65 years , more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
heavy hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i &apos;s standards for heavy bleeding as defined in table 2 .
both slight as well as heavy hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with Hep@@ atic plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular blood @-@ reflection of ≥ 4 g / d@@ x without obvious blood pressure , reduction of hem@@ ost@@ atic reflection of ≥ 3 g / d@@ L with known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ ali@@ ations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; Pun@@ ishment , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ ses , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in in 6,000 patients who under@@ gone a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in Group , as well as in the patients treated with Hep@@ p@@ ic groups , was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both slight as well as heavy bleeding came in significantly less often than in the compar@@ ative group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported according to comprehensive use in practice and are arranged according to system organic classes in table 6 .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm , or administered as continuous fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not have enough insulin for the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood , or the insulin can not work effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very margin@@ ally of human insulin and the change means that it operates faster and shorter life time than a short @-@ effective Human@@ ism .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes where the insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indic@@ ative for the effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % with insulin l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal levels .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other ingredients , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can effect on blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ venti@@ s Germany GmbH an approval for the market launch of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of abdominal ceiling , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions or sub@@ cut@@ aneous in the area of the pancre@@ as .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin treatment , insulin requirement may be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of the impact strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , ink@@ delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of operation may take a change of insulin requirement .
3 A in@@ sufficient dos@@ ing or the demol@@ ition of a treatment , in particular in patients with insulin requiring diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and an diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these states are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient on a different insulin type or insulin any other manufacturer should be done under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the time of a hypo@@ glyc@@ emia depends on the effect of the insulin injec@@ tions and can therefore change the schem@@ as when changing the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances which enhance blood glucose levels , anti@@ diabe@@ tic acid , angi@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , fi@@ br@@ ate , ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amine @-@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics , such as beta block@@ ers , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine , and reserves the symptoms of ad@@ r@@ ener@@ gen anti@@ g@@ ents might be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies for reproductive @-@ icity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ism regarding the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ ins occur in human breast milk , but generally , insulin does not occur in or into breast milk , nor is res@@ or@@ ously absorbed after oral application .
in the following are from clinical trials known , adverse medicines are listed , sorted by system organic classes and are frequent : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .

Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is failed to continuously change the injection unit within the injection range , can occur in a row of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy on injection .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with loss of loss can be treated by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 - 1 mg ) , which is given by a physician or administered by intraven@@ ous medication by a doctor .
after a glu@@ co@@ agon@@ in@@ ject , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the periph@@ eral glucose levels ( especially due to skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glucose in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ ism occurs faster and the duration of time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal levels .
in a study with 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in therapeutic doses of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional glucose monitoring effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more , a proportional increase of the glucose @-@ cosmic effect , just like human@@ ism .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect of action such as normal human@@ ism and achieves a complete glucose @-@ cosmic effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was clearly seen that at an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ational gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , 30 minutes before the meal is given .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meals , it has been achieved a better post @-@ pran@@ ational control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is applied for 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control of the meal is given ( see Figure 1 ) , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control of the meal is reached ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for gift 2 minutes ( previously ) before the start of meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human@@ kind normal levels ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine in gift 15 minutes ( after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human nor@@ ms ) , which was given 2 minutes before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) before the start of the meal .
