<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Transport Report (EPAR), which will be explained as the Committee for Humanitarian (CHMP) in which the Committee for Humanity (CHMP) has been evaluated in order to proceed to recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your illness or treatment, please read the packet age (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for entry (1 mg / ml) and as injectioning solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic condition, in which the patients have different episodes (periods of abnormal sentiment) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe Manical episodes and to prevent manical episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for quick control of disturbing agitation or behavioral disorders, if oral intake is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution for insertion or melting tablets are applied in patients with which the gorges of tablets are processed.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be adjusted, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is thought of mainly as "partial Agonist," for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower dimensions than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recovery of the symptoms was investigated in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar diseases resulting in increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was reduced over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which had been stabilized to 160 patients with which the manian symptoms were stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injectioning solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that were compared to increased agitation by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also took studies in order to investigate how the body gets the melting tablets and the solution to take-up (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injectioning solution for patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly higher reduction in symptoms increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application of the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was more effective than placebo in four of the five short-time studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the recurve effects of Manical episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses reduced significantly more effective than placebo the symptoms increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), vomiting, blurred vision, headache, blurred vision (increased memory production), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), vomiting, Nausea (dizziness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety disorders.</seg>
<seg id="25">The committee on Humanitarian agents (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from middle-severe episodes in patients who had mainly manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazol, in contrast to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution for rapid control of disturbing unrest and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the distribution of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode of patients, the mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proved, although some patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, independent of meals as a mono- or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients suffering from 65 years was not proved.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justifiable (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the arithmezol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disturbances and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of anti-psychological therapy, also for treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, no increased suicides risk associated with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used to treat patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure drugs) or hypertonia (including akzelerated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that followed one year or less, there were occasional reports during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in case of an ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dymus, should be taken into consideration, reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has developed signs and symptoms that indicate a mns or unclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used in patients with seizures in the anamnies or cases that are related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis who are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted zerebrovascular events with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoazija or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic medication, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medication-treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipits, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally known in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics where weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy life of life and might lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripiprazol, the central nervous system is careful when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, although this effect is not relevant as clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinese in) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be performed similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") Metabolising can result the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensible metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the joint gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should overweigh the potential risks for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, might have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosage height before the onset of the escale therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Dilatex or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 in common with ABILIFY can be calculated with a moderate increase of the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (dextromethamorphan / 3 Methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be given to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data situation for the safety in humans and due to the reproductive studies in the animal may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against, dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, and they are sure that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical-relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyilo were treated with patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients received under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled study study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients with Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was under Aripiprazol treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% treated patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases by CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neurologistical syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicism, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate overdosixes have been observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information about the effectiveness of a hematalysis treatment in the treatment of a sureation with Aripiprazol; it is unlikely that hemoralysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefit is, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I interruption on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor as well as a moderate affinity for Dopamine D4, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 adrying and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in doses of 0,5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the Positons Emission-tomography showed a dosing-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudatus and in the cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 Shizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazole compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-controlled study, 52 the proportion of patients who had a response to study medications were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring structures, defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depression-Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in response rate showed at 34% in the Aripiquol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study involved in schizophrenia, a total of 314 patients (N = 18 or 13% of valuable patient data) significantly decreased a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy compared to placebo in the reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled mono- study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled mono- studies in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazole showed a positive effect on placebo in week 3 and an experience effect that was comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of manie on like Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which showed partial over 2 weeks not on Lithium- or Valproat-Monotherapy, an superior efficacy in the reduction of manian symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in various patients who were achieved with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation period prior to placebo in relation to prevention of a bipolar return, primarily in the prevention of a bipolar return.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro diagnostic studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyzole, which is responsible for the N-Dealkyung by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination season is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolising over CYP2D6 and for nearly 146 hours with 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of Pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences concerning ethnicity or the effect of the room on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokineic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to pull anchor on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity with repeated gift, reproduction of toxicity, gene otoxicity, and the carcinogenic potential, the pre-clinical data could not recognize any special dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with doses or expositions that exceeded the maximum dose or exposure when humans have exceeded them only limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects of fibrous a dosing-dependant-toxicity (AUC) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3-10 mg / kg per day (corresponding to 3 times the middle Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholecthiasis was found as a result of the failure of sulphate conjugates from Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral gift of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended dose of clinical dose or 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were found at concentrations of sulfate - Aripiprazole not more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and lie well below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">These effects were observed after dosages that were observed for expositions of 3 and 11fold the middle Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased liquor hydrogenase in the blood, increased creators in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in blood cancers:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dyes agie, palsy, affectionate, dry mouth, shattering gum, loose chair, ointophagitis, sorrows in the mouth, oral pain, rectal blood disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the breast-wall, weakness of musculature, genetic pain, pain pains, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flange pain, uneasiness in the songs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of sensitivity to survival is calculated based on a defined fall in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, there are no estimates of the actual frequency possible and there was no significant connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubuli-active ingredient that promotes resistance of microtubuli from the tubes and microtubuli by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilisation leads to a inhibiting of normal dynamic reorganisation of microtubultural network which is essential for the vitational interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin has facilitated the transocytosis of plasma components in the endothelial cells and in the context of in vitro studies, that the presence of Albumin's transport was encourages by endothelaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this enhanced transendothelial transport is communicated by the gp-60 Albuminrereceptor and due to the albuminous Proteins SPARC (prted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-binding studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received an allergy sufferers at paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, as a 3-hour infusion with premediation for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 than 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an adverse general state (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastasia.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% only had a adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% because of metasterosion and 19% because of metastasation and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 Results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease and progression-free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy a peripheral neuropathy degree 3 was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural process of peripheral neuropathy to sound on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Pharmacokinetic of the Total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The linear exposition (AUC) increased from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration took place on a multi-phase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has an extensive external distribution and / or turnout connection of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel have been compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was after the Abraxane gift higher (43%) than after a solvent paclitaxel injection, and even the distribution volume was Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating, paclitaxel is reported primarily on 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and for two smaller Metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α--p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative oil was reduced by less than 1% of the total dose of 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a vast non-renal cleance.</seg>
<seg id="323">Over the age of more than 75 years, however, only few data are available, since only 3 patients of these age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light-protected light over 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="358">• School brochure • summary of the features of the medicine (specialist information), labeling and packing age. • With unique image representation of the correct use of the product sank cooling boxes for transportation through the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseams is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and also contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood levels, where in connection with blood transfusion complications might occur, in case prior to the procedure a blood circulation is not possible, and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with seams has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician, which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, for which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood circulation, Abseamed is injected into a vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be made from the patient or the maintainmentor, as long as they have received an appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemostatic values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilene in adults, respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron ore supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a erythropoietinmangel, or thereby the body does not adequately affect the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell that was associated to a gene (DNA), which is responsible for the formation of epoxetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to a study of 479 patients with 479 patients, compared to one of kidney problems caused anaemia, compared with the reference intake.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks in Eprex / Erypo in a Vene before they were either transferred to Abseamed or continue to get Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Main indicative for the effectiveness was the change of hemostatic values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also used the results of a study in which the effects were speculated by Eprex / Erypo with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia, the hemostatic values of patients who were converted to Abseamed, were calculated in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients receiving Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12,0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseams is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, sticking, migrant headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Seams should not be used in patients, which may be more sensitive (allergic) against epetin alfa or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seams as injections under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The end of the European Union Committee (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the medicine has been implemented according to the rules of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality, security and efficacy profile like Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, the seams, will provide for medical specialists in all Member States information, including information about security of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice medicines at Pütter GmbH & Co. kg a permit for the distribution of seams across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anemia and reduction in the Transfusion requirement for adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphoma or multiply myeloma who received chemotherapy, and the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, preexisting anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron mangel is not available or inadequate, with planned larger operating interventions (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For reduction in foreign blood, Absear can be applied in front of a major elective dontic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency, where a high risk of transaction is expected.</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except with pädiatric patients that should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anesmiesysymptoms and success data can be different depending on age, gender and total disease-load; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease management is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin increased by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, patients may occasionally be observed in a patient individual hemostatic values over or under hemogglobin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemostatic variability, the hemoglobin target should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemostatic value exceeds more than 2 g / ddl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the long-lasting hemostatic value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be supervised, to ensure that epetin alfa is the lowest dose which is needed for control of anemia and antigen symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) possibly require higher yields in patients where the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) possibly require higher yields in patients where initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 mg / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 mg / kg (three times a week), until the desired target is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anesmiesysymptoms and - subsequent publications may be different depending on age, gender and total disease-load; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease management is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemostatic variability, the hemoglobin target should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be supervised, to ensure that epetin alfa is the lowest dose which is needed for control of antigen symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of the hemostatic value of at least 1 g / dl. (0.62 mmol / l), or the Retikulozytenancy amounts to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be kept up to 150 mg / kg three times a week or 450 kg / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemostatic growth was increased &lt; 1 g / dum (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the Retikulocyte &lt; 40,000 cells / µl opposite the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 kg / kg three times a week.</seg>

<seg id="401">If the hemoglobrate value increased by &lt; 1 g / dum (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the Retikulocytes increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl opposite the initial value, an response to the epetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with light anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), with which the pre-caring storage of ≥ 4 blood-conservative is required, abseamed in a dose of 600 kg / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before operating procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">With the iron substitution, as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the start of autologous blood propulses - started to provide large iron reserves at the beginning of the sewage therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 mg / kg epetin alfa, which should be given weekly over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the operating procedure and the day of the intervention (day 0).</seg>

<seg id="406">Alternatively, injection can be given at the end of the dialysis via the hose of a fistelnadel, followed by 10 ml isotonic cooking solution to rinse the hose and ensuring an adequate injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients receiving treatment with any erythromboetine in a erythroblastie (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not be affected or any other erythropocetine (see section 4.4 - Erythroblaenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, instabile Angina pectoris, increased risk for deep venenthrombosis (e.g. anamnetically known venous thrombembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are planned for a bigger elective dontic procedure, the use of epoxetin alfa is contrasted: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial infections, vascular disease of carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently noted heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastie (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti-condensed PRCA after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden change of effects, the Retikulocytotals (1 - 2 g / ddl per month) should be determined and the usual causes for non-failure (ice, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminum infections or infections, blood loss and hemolysis) should be examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocyte value is normal, taking into account of anemia (i.e. the Retikulocytes "Index"), and if no other foundation is found, the anti-erythropoetine antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow to diagnose a PRCA diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunity in subcutaneous use of abseams in patients with a risk-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 patients with chronic renal insufficiency should not be exceeded the recommended level of hemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular disease were observed when erythropoese-stimulating active ingredients (ESA) with a hemostatic target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) were given.</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is due to the gift of epoxins, when the hemostatic concentration over the control of antiviral symptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions is required.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemostatic increase should not exceed 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evidence of heart failure, cardiac disease-sufficiency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 of the recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anemia with epoxetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency which are not yet dialysis, the progression of renal insufficiency is not accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="420">Patients with chemotherapy was to be considered for the assessment of the treatment efficiency of epetin alfa a 2-3-week delay between epetin-alfa-gift and erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transluded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / ddl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapyielded anemia - Dosisadjustment with the aim to keep the hemoglobrate value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for application recombinable Erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction in the patient's participation, which should also consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients receiving an orthopaedic procedure, if possible, before the beginning of epoxetin-alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia is examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undertake care of an orthopaedic procedure should have an appropriate Thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have increased risk for thrombotic and vasculous diseases, particularly with an underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it can not be excluded from treatment with epetin alfa for patients with an initial value of &gt; 13 g / dl of increased risk of postoperative thrombotic and vasculular events.</seg>

<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epetin alfa is a dosing-dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment with erythropoetines.</seg>

<seg id="589">For treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in males a intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended every year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fractionate the administration of Aclasta is recommended for two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip fractionate (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">Aclasta's treatment should only be prescribed by doctors, experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta a long term was observed in patients who have addressed to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient supply of calcium, corresponding to at least 500 mg of elemental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="596">Patients with kidney disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose of dose is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, because data are missing for inconcessibility and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), because of these patient population only limited clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="600">An existing hypokalemia is before the onset of therapy with acetsta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Zoledronic acid on bone structure, a temporary hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient supply of calcium, corresponding to at least 500 mg of elemental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125.000, oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the Horizon-RFT study increased the Aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BMD at the total threadiness and chenkelhals for all periods.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BMD by 5.4% in total revenues and 4.3% on the scraper huts.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon-RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients evaluated the BMD after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction in clinical trials in men; the incidence of clinical trials was 7.5% at Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308) once again an annual meeting of Aclasta in comparison to the weekly gift of alendrenat relative to the percentage point of change of the Lendenibel-BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone of Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially light until moderate mornings Paget of the Knochens (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2,6fold up to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid compared to taking 30 mg of fracedronate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">According to the combined results, a similar decrease of pain strength and pain-affected has been observed in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronate for 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as a responsive study at the end of the six month (based on the therapy) were included in a follow-up period.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response in 141 of the patients who were treated with Aclasta, compared with 71 patients treated with Risedronate, could be preserved in a medium term of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-one and multiple 5-15 minute infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosing independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Afterwards, the plasma concentration quickly increased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Fast-phase disappearance of the large cycle with half-value times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long Elimination phase with a season of elimination of elimination season t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above-mentioned ½ -values) represent the rapid resorption in the bones and the excretory over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours you can find 39 ± 16% of the recommended dose in urine, while the rest mainly is bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-cleance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zoledronacid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance by Cytochrom-P450 enzymes, metabolic substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is non-metabolic and because they are not a weak or not a direct and / or irreversible, fuel-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal cleance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of Kreatinin-Clearance, and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This makes a slight (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney-function up to a creatinin-Clearance to 35 ml / min does not require a dose of dose to the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because of severe kidney disorder (Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), only restricted data are not possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-effective intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In trials involving dogs were single doses ranging from 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal impairment.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application has been identified as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6-minute infusion of 0.25 mg / kg, administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose, corresponding to the 7fold the humane therapeutic exposure), related to the AUC, is well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application of cumulative expositions that the maximum of the planned human exposure occurred sufficiently, toxic effects of other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in studies with repeated application was a proliferated primary Spongiosa in the metaphysivity of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses, a satisfaction, which reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats one observed a teratogenicity with doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced as 0,1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum-calcium-mirror.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Service Report (EPAR), which will be explained as the Committee for Humanitarian agents (CHMP) to proceed to recommendations on the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients), with which Metformin (diabetic medicine) is used. • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), the metformin alone can not be satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonduous material or insulin can be kept the previous dose of sulfiyllic acid or insulin delivery, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfonyllic acid and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be used better and the blood sugar level decreases, eliminating type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acetone in tripletherapy was examined; the patients received a combination of metformin using a sulfonyllic, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycemylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the glucose levels have been lowered when using the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplea study, the effect of the additional gift of action to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyllic material in a decrease of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin has been examined in 289 patients, the patients suffering from Actos in addition to insulin took a reduction of HbA1c levels of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% of the patients who took placebo in addition.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were blurred vision, infections of the upper respiratory tracts (cold cuts), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients with potentially sensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic acid (high ketones - acid level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to establish an authorization of action from Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one page the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inadequate in which metformin due to contraindications or disorder (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years no data are available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least one risk factor (e.g. prior cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or odems, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and eyelids, when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiac disease outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced pharmacological disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard) or with other signs of a liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror are increased to 3 times the limit of the standard range, the liver cells are as soon as possible to control again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develop symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, emesis, upper-degradation, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark hardn, are the liver ability to check.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon should be continued until the presentation of the laboratory parameters will be conducted by clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dosing-dependent weight gain was detected, which can touch of liposal deposits, and in some cases connected with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemogame, a minor reduction in the medium hemostatic values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) appeared.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3.6-4.1% and hematocrits by 3.6-4.1%) and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazon as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyllic acid or as a two-step combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dosing hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch in the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, about an occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular dems reported in a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazon and the appearance of maculaödems should be aware of the possibility of a macular dems when patients report on the vision of vision; a suitable ophthalmic declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of unwanted events concerning bone broods from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fractional incidence amounted to 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone and 1.1 Fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROactive study, a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractions per 100 patient years) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparable mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to pregnancy or enter this, the treatment is aboutdated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for investigation of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines prescribed by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reduction inhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon for 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease of the AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable to the treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance to the parent, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100; &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (of this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">They lead to a temporary change of the tower and refraction of lentils, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic drug ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT-pin came across the three times the upper limit of the normal range as far as placebo, but less than in comparative groups under Metformin or Sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with existing pharmacological disease, the frequency of a severe cardiac insufficiency was 1,6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazone bzan.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its launch, rarely over heart failure in Pioglitazon was reported, however, more frequently if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamorous.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summarizing analysis of unwanted events concerning bone broods from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon groups and more than 7,400 patients treated in the comparative groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparable mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">During taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day after seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears on an activation of specific core receptors (peroxisome proliferator), resulting in the animal model to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study conducted by Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monolazid as monolazid was continued over two years to investigate the period until the reproduction of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient, despite three-phase optimizing phase with insulin, to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone reduced the average HbA1c - value by 0.45% compared to patients who continue to continue insulin; a reduction of insulin injections were observed in the group of Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotiation compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (mono- with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, based on 18 weeks of study on type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma-triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL Cholesterinspiegel and slightly higher, but clinically not increased LDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to Plazebo, there was no statistically significant increase in the LDL Cholesterinspiegel, while under Metformin and Gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglyceride level, but also improved the posterior margin of triglyceride level, both of a effect on triglyceride absorption, as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROactive study, a cardiac disease outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced pharmacological disease were randomized in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the top concentration of pioglitazone in plasma is usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interventions studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive inactive pioglitazone, the marker was found mainly in the cases (55%) and to a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination season of unchangeable Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans and the entire active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, with mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, agreed after repeated administration with plasma volume enlargement, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophic.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to that under treatment with pioglitazon the insulin resistance of hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance of the parent is diminished, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">Long-term studies (up to 2 years old) were induced by hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (male rats) of the uretic epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family-known polyposis (FAP) the treatment led with two other Thiazolidindions to an elevated frequency of colontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fractional incidence amounted to 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone and 1.1 Fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROactive study, a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractions per 100 patient years) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparable mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years the effects of a combination of combination of metformin, with pioglitazone or gliclad were studied.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotiation compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglyceride level, but improved the posterior margin increased triglyceride level, which is both above a effect on tryglyceride absorption and also on hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the goal of its primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly myocardial infarction, strokes, acute coronarisation, leg amputation above the Knuckle, coronarisation and reascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazon are not connected to cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of unwanted events concerning bone broods from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials were treated with over 8,400 patients who received with Pioglitazon and over 7,400 patients who received comparative medication, increased incidence of bone broods in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROactive study, a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractions per 100 patient years) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparable mediation.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was administered in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas is not able to produce insulin and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycemylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which shows how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, which indicates that the blood sugar level is similar to a similar human resource.</seg>

<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage should be kept only under the tightening control of one in the transplantation of an experienced medical device (see section 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosing adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patient with reduced liver function to maintain blood concentrations in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with serious liver disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function, Da kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose of dose is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephroxic potentials of tactile function, however, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum concentration, calculation of the creatinct content and monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a ciclosporin to a tactile-based therapy is required (see section 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the valley mirror in full blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of shock and tolerability in individual case of impregnation of full blood-tactile tactile-level inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended common controls of tacrolimus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood Talmud mirror from tacrolimus should also change after changing from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosage adjustment, changes of the immune suppressive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the tactile concentrations of blood concentrations (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible, if the valley level is not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley levels of Tacrolimus lie in full blood in the first time according to liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and the patient's heart transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac grafts were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplanders or other side effects, which can appear in a sequence of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; rendering the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the engmeshly control of a medical device (see section 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with grafts from transplant reactions, which proved to be treated opposite other immune suppressors, are still no clinical data for retardation formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1442">To prophylaxis of transplants of grafts for adults and grafts in childhood, no clinical data are yet no clinical data for retardation formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which can lead to a hernification of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the Johanniskraut (hypericum perforatum) is to avoid or other plant-enhelling during a treatment with Advagraphs (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tactile concentrations in the blood is provided, because the tactile blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases referred to as a cardiomyopathy, chamber or septumhypertrophic was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advagraphs.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, fluid overload and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immune suppression, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or use of solar control with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of the application addressed, if Advise is used for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of hemorrhage in surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII lack, which causes blood clots such as bleeding in the joints, muscles, or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method used as "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that was associated to a gene (DNA) which enabled them to make the formation of the human body factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advances is another drugs approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is otherwise stated that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine was investigated by preventing blood tests as well as surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of advancies in the prevention of blood tests in 86% of 510 new blood pressure is awarded with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexate (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances must not be used in patients who possibly are insensitive (allergic) against the human form factor VIII, mouse, or hamster protein or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG to provide a approval for placing Advance in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: dosage and duration of substitution therapy are based on the severity of the factor VIII-deficiency, after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma concentration (in% of the norm or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat, until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment, the recommended dose and frequency of injections must be appropriate to determine the factor VIII-plasma seal.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo Recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII per kilogram of body weight in the distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed to assign an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be set after the patient's request, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the prokoagulatory activity of VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlated with the extent of exposure to a factor VIII, with the risk within the first 20 exposition days at the largest and other factors depend on genetic and other factors.</seg>

<seg id="1562">In the previously untreated clinical study, 5 out of 25 (20%) were treated with ADVATE disease inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins were analysed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti-Cho-cellist, otherwise no signs or symptoms occur on an allergic reaction to an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data approval from the CHMP, CHMP has still considered a positive rating, but in consideration that safety profile can be closely supervised by the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP has based on the basis of the security process of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided to apply further extension procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited has officially distributed the Committee for Humanitarian Affairs Committee (CHMP) that the company has recovering its proposal to authorization Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the crossover components (tissues, the other structures in the body combines, surrounds and relies on).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that genetically modified genetically so that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has changed so that there is no copies of themselves and no infections can trigger in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advances would have been injected directly into the tumours and to make the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced by the non defect in the human body is formed by p53 gene, usually contributes to the restoring DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni-cancer, the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancerous cells can grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with the Li-Fraumeni-Cancer in the area of the subjection, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had reviewed the answer of the company, some questions were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the inspection of the initially submitted documents, CHMP has compiled a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion has not been verified that injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni tumours takes benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of medication in the body, the type of administration, as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proved that Advexin can be produced in reliable ways, and that there is neither for the environment even for people who come in touch with the patients that is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company won't know the CHMP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered drug release" means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy against pollen) in patients with nasal mudskin irritation (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents 12 years of age, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and finished once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug may be able to stop constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measurements were the changes of the severity of the hypocrispy symptoms that were reported from the patient before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In observation of all hypocrisp symptoms except the constipation of the nose reported patients who have Aerinaze income, compared with 35.9% compared to 35.9% in patients who were suffering from pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-mucosa has been viewed, the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who had Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), oral malignity, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity, anemulation, headache, tiredness, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerobic may not be used in patients who may not be prescribed (allergic) against Desloratadin, pseudoephedrin or one of the other ingredients, against adrenerated active ingredients or Loratadin (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients that suffer from a bottomous glaucoma (hypertension), heart disease or vascular disease including hypertension (hypertension) or already a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by cerebral hemorrhage) or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to provide an approval for the distribution of aerosaze in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to swallow in the whole (i.e. without them to crush, break or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied for children under 12 years due to the error of data on the unquestionable and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after separation of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as long-term application can take the activity of pseudoephedrin at the time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After declining the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, the treatment can be continued with Desloratadin as a monocline.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine, the medicine also contains contraindications in patients who are treated with a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephsine, pergoid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, phenylproergotamine, phenylephrin, ephedrine, oxymetazolin, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective, and the data are not enough to address relevant recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data are not enough to address relevant recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment with the occurrence of hypertonic or a tachywheel or of palpitations, arrhythmias, nausea, or other neurological symptoms (such as headache, or gain of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patient groups, patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamorous, diabetes mellitus, bladder infections or bronchospasmus in the history of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests, since antihistaminants prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce or in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin who were administered in erythromycin or ketoconazole, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">There were no significant differences between the results of the psychomotor tests could be detected between the patients with Desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the disaster has not been identified, so that interaction with other drugs cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor any inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconcision of the use of aerosaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in the frequency of abnormalities in comparison with the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As a reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted on human beings and on the basis of vasoconstriction properties of pseudoephedrin should not be applied in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">The patients should however be clarified, however, that it may occur in very rare cases in a benchmark, that can cause a impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (seaweed, apnea, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collars) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, Tremor, Convulsions).</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, frightening disease, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tension, euphoria, excitement, breathing difficulties, nausea, vomiting, corruptions, dizziness, tinnitus, asaxia, tendons and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially likely, as well as atropin typical symptoms (oral-drying, pupillenstarre and - dilatation, hood, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibiting of releasing cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human Mastcells / Basophilen as well as the inhibiting of expression of the adhesion's P-seless to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes, including the amplification of subjective slaughter, or the tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin at the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachywheel or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took part 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine-agonistic efficacy of aerosaze tablets, determined by the total cores for the symptom (except nose loops), significantly higher than monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the weakening effect, determined by the nasal mutilisation, was significantly higher than a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the Pharmacokinetic of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is demonstrable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the flowbalance of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosing study, which was carried out with the formulation of healthy adult subjects was found that four volunteers Desloratadin badly versely tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) from pseudoephedrin, after the sole gift of pseudoephedrin, was the exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, for comotoxicity, and Reproductive Toxicity, however, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin may have no special dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproducible clinical studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrin was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 the application of the Pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamaminants contribute to the allergic symptoms by preventing them that histamine, a body-own substance, can produce its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerosaze tablets left symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as Niesen, running or judiced nose and drowning eyes at the same time constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by using the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of addling, impairment of sleep and performance on the days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There were further studies presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution for insertion and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children unquestionable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two weeks treatment with 5 mg Aerius had received an average decrease of symptoms of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to decrease from 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urtikaria the decrease of the symptoms were compared to six weeks treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who possibly are insensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadin or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe to provide authorization to the public transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see section 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease and can be taken after the closing of the symptoms and resumed with their re-occur.</seg>
<seg id="1732">During persistent allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), patients can be recommended in the patient during the allergies time.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole have been given (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, NSC erius and alcohol is not reinforced with the performance reduction of alcohol (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">The patients should however be clarified, however, that it may occur in very rare cases, that can lead to impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, when patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common side effects, which was reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1,2%), oral-drying (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect of headaches were treated with 5.9% of the patients who were treated with desloratine and at 6.9% of the patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study administered up to 45 mg desloratadadin (nine times clinical dose), no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibiting of releasing cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human Mastcells / Basophilen as well as the inhibiting of expression of the adhesion's P-seless to endothelialcells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses, in the desloratine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovasculous effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the Desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nestly of clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosing study, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes, including the amplification of subjective slaughtering or the tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in the symptoms of symptoms such as Niesen, secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistently allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the total cores of the cargo of life in Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively decreased the load by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria has been investigating for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology has been deemed in the different forms, and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the history of aminant is an ursor factor in all urtic diseases, Desloratadin is expected to improve in other forms of the urticaria in other forms of the urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the lowering of size and number of addling at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminants in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of the patients who did not reacted to Antihistamine, was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of youth up more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients who treated patients treated with placebo-treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced disturbance of sleep and wax significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate this variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, in 4% of patients had a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no reference points for a clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the disaster has not been identified, however, that interaction with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor any inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with desloratadin in a dose of 7,5 mg, meals (fetal rich, calorie-rich breakfast) does not apply to the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical studies presented with Desloratadin and Loratadin conducted in clinical trials, with a comparable degree of exposure of Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences of the toxicity of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity in repeated gift, genotoxicity, and reproducible xicity, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin may have no special dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains Hypromflawless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken irrespective of meals for the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The indescribable doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see below 4.4) and that no data are available, which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">For about 6% of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11, metabolic desloratella is restricted and experienced a higher substance load (see under Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The security of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years of age which metabolic metabolic is identical with the children who metabolic normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with inherited problems of a fructose intolerance, glucose-gactless absorption shielding or a sucrose-isomaltor insufficiency of this medication should not be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole have been given (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, intake of Aerius tablets and alcohol is not reinforced with the performance reduction of alcohol (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall stability of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as with the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, when patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, who were administered up to 45 mg Desloratadin (nine times clinical dose), no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used for adults and elderly people to protect the flu caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a strain of influenza virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus, which can easily spread to humans, because humans still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus as "body-foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">In this way, the immune system is able to form an influenza virus in a contact with a influenza virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the virus manure of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which detects the human body as a body-alienated), cleaned and used as a part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites demonstrated that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This led to the extent of the clinical data base for the assessment of safety of the vaccine, in order to meet the requirements of the guidelines on the EMEA for prepandemical vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who can do not swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for entry, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir, because the security of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be contracted when the physician has checked out which antiviral medicines of the patient had previously taken, and the probability has judged that the virus is applied to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is aimed at the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Aging in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and holding them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not to heal but can cause damage to the immune system and so that the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases can also be delayed.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was examined in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, previously untreated protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The pharmaconavir reinforced medicine Azoase was compared with 206 adults who had taken previously protease inhibitors, compared with other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indiator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-proven concentrations of HIV in the blood (Virusload) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who previously had not taken a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under Placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the virusload, but with the children that had been treated earlier with protease inhibitors, only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults who had been treated earlier with protease inhibitors, the virusload increased the viral load after 16-weeks treatment as well as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitor, it came to a more powerful waste of the virusload after four weeks in the patient who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase must not be used in patients, which may be insensitive (allergic) against Amdetavir or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase can also not be applied in patients, the Johanniskraut (a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are the same as Agenerase, and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As in other medicines for HIV consists of patients who are taking Agenerase, the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonekrose (dying of bone tissue) or an immunreactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection that are caused by restoring the immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Commission's Humanitarian Association (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicine used to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is generally taken together with the pharmacokineic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not have a protease inhibitor is not detected.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the approval of scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited to provide an approval for the market launch of Agenerase in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicine for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitor (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Azoase capsules are to be given to pharmacokineic Boobs of Ambavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see section 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amdetavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambavir as a solution for entry is 14% less than one of Ambuavir as capsule; therefore, agrams capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg Ambuavir twice daily together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforced addition of Ritonavir (Boobs), higher doses have to be applied to Azoase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Ambuavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicine up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Ambavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for the use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data to unquestionable and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Azoase capsules in adult patients with medium-heavier liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with serious liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application is expected to be treated with a lighter or moderate liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, which contain Johanniskraut (hypericum perforatum), may not be used due to the risk of reducing plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of ambavir during the ingestion of Ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy did not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually Azoase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medication (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy, increased risk for heavy liver interactions with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronically active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under a antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluorticason or other glucocorticoids, which is not recommended by CYP3A4, is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment including morphological effects, including Morbus Cushing and suppression of the triniotic function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Because the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, is not recommended for simultaneous risk of myopath including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards Agency), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma concentration of ambuavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with ambvir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptiva may be altered, however, the information cannot be sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given at the same time with Ambvir, the patients should therefore be monitored on the opiatenttion symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity, due to the high propaganda content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be removed for duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitor, was reported via the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses caused by their therapy, which are associated with the development of a type of diabetes mellitus, or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and the metabolic disorders associated with metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophile patients (Type A and B), which were treated with protease inhibitors, are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous melanoma and hematthrosen.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune disease, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residuous opportunistic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunohemesis, higher body mass index), were reported cases of osteonekrose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with minor therapeutic effect can not be used simultaneously with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with minor therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be used together with medicines whose ingredients are mainly associated with CYP2D6 and are connected to increased plasma concentration with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in the AUC by Ambavir, which can cause a virological failure and cause resistance to resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the stress concentrations of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) can be humiliated by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with currants (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already encrouch, the ambuil levels are, and, if possible to check the viral load and add the curd.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with ambabor (see also Emotiirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% is increased for up to 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with ambavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of ambuavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily applied to illustrate the effectiveness and integrity of this treatment schematics.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humiliated if Ambabor (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ambavir in plasma, which were achieved during the combination of Ambabor (600 mg per day) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ambavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended to be a engmeshy monitoring, because the effectiveness and unquestionable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with Didanosin, however, due to the antaicide component of didanosin, however, the proceeds from Didanosin and Agenerase will lie at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with ambuavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) do not require dose to dose.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Estimirenz in combination with Ambavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be lower.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitor and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin probably reduces the serum concentration of Amdetavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medication should be used simultaneously, caution, because Delavirdin is less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When this medicine is applied together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be carried out, as an exact forecast of the effect of combination of ambuavir and Ritonavir is difficult to Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Ambavir and Rifabutin led to a rise in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus to a rise in associated side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, ricutin together with Agenerase is required to reduce the dose of ricutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with agenerase in combination with erythromycin is not performed, however, the plasma concentration of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of tetoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and AUC (0 replies) to 2,69fold in comparison to the value which was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below are also substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, if they are used together with Azoase, possibly to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients therefore should therefore be connected to toxic reactions associated with these drugs, if they are applied in combination with Azoase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that Antazida can't be taken at the same time as Azoase, as it can come to resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulva, known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with ambavir can lead to a lower level of plasma concentration of ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Roodipine, Ninidipin, Nimodipine, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased by 10 by Ambuavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with Agenerase can increase their plasma concentration and increases with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotics, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily), the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased by approximately 86% (90% condensing interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended with these glucocorticoids, unless the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic cognitive effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, their metabolism is strongly dependent of CYP3A4, are distinct to expect the plasma concentration in simultaneous handling of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma increases of this HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including one Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this drug is not recommended with ambvir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as well as stabilization of the mirror, since the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased at the same time of ambuvir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be applied together with oral totem Midazolam (see section 4.3) while simultaneous use of Agenerase with parenteral tenolam caution is required.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible rise of the plasma concentration of Midazolam around the 3 to 4-fouache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with Ambavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on the opiatentary symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the very low reliability of historical comparability, currently no recommendation can be given, like the ambazr dose is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International normalised ranatio) is recommended for the possibility of a weakening or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods for contraception prevention is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the simultaneous gift of adgenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be applied for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk-activated rats, Ambavir-related substances have been detected, however, it is not known whether Ambabor overpasses people into the breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of perceptive rats which was administered by the income in uterus to the end of the breastfeeding Ambavir, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the breastfeeding period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of postnatity including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Ambavir to the mothertier.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The inconcessibility of Agenerase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the Agenerase-associated side effects were slightly up to moderate, occurred early in early, and rarely resulted in treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether in connection with the intake of Agenerase or any other at the same time for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underunderage.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above adverse events are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), where protease inhibitors did not pre-treated patients 1200 mg agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Occurrences (Grade 2 to 4), which were identified as indicated in connection with study medication, and more than 1% of patients were performed as well as under the treatment of laboratory changes (degrees 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with HIV patients (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and malignant fat tissue, increasing intracellous and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophie of the breasts and dorsovikal fat collection (bull).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretrospectively known individuals who had been treated with ambabor in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a median duration of 36 weeks, was observed only a case (bull) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, patients treated at 245 NRTIG in 245 patients (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a median duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin suggestions were usually slightly up to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with ambvir had to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonekrose cases were particularly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune disease, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residuous opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg agenerase twice daily together with low dosified Ritonavir (degrees 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degrees 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degrees 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), who received Agenerase together with low dosified Ritonavir, very frequent occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of a superdoation, the patient is to observe signs of an Intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, are necessary support measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amdetavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and prevents the process of viral gag- and gag pol- polyproteinogenic levels with the result of a formation of unprovable, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ambavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both on acute and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as to peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amdetavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0,08 µm with acute cells and amounts to 0,41 µm with chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The link between the activity of Ambavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 Replication involving human beings is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">With the treatment of antiretrospectively previously treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - such as other Ritonavir pooed treatment schemas demonstrated - the mutations described only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretrospectively, patients who received 700mg of Fossilavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred until week 48, with 14 isolates genotypic could be studied.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the Isolate of 13 of 14 children, where a virological failure occurred within the 59, with protease inhibitors not pre-treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those with adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, V3R, V3R, V3V, I47V, I50V, I50V, I50V, V77I, V82A, V82A, V82A, V82A, V82A, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fossilavir twice daily, n = 107) participated with protease inhibitors in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">On genotypical resistance systems based on genotypical interpretative systems can be used to estimate the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The present (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistence than the presence of mutations L10F / I, L33F, M82a, V82A, V82A, V82A, V82A, V82A, V82A, V82a, V82A and L90M, with a reduced advantage of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations are subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended, always the current interpretative systems to analyse the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">In combination with the genotypic resistance systems based analyses based on phenotypic interpretative systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies, testing the diagnostic resistance tests, have developed clinically-photypic cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Ambavir associated genetic patterns produces a certain crucifixion against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data to cross resistance between ambavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fossilavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on five-five antiretrospectively, a limited cross-resistant resistance against Lopinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), monquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Ambuavir reserves his activity against some other protease inhibitor insulated isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early demolition of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in borders, which can affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on four generase (600 mg twice daily) together with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidy (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, primarily associated with dosified Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one another PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-subsidy of APV / Ritonavir in relation to the time adjusted average changes from the initial value (AAUCMB) in plasma-load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-approved shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the effectiveness of unbundled Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, 152 of which were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was assessed and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosified Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) along with ARTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients in the study included plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Basically on these data should be considered to be expected with PI pre-treated children of expected gain of "unbundled" Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the medium length (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amdetavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% is increased for up to 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered along with Amdetavir (600 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amdetavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Hence the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can conclude on a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration capacity of ambavir from the blood circulation in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the drug in plasma, with the amount of untreated ambuvir, which represents the active proportion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of untreated ambabor remains constant, the percentage of the free active ingredients in the metady concentration in the Steady State is dependent on the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore we have to display the CYP3A4 inductors or a substrate of CYP3A4 with caution when they are given at the same time using Agenerase (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily ambulance exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is made from the solution 14% less bioavailability than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Azoase are not interchangeable on a milligrammar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal cleance of Ritonavir is negligible, so the effect of a kidney-function may be low on elimination of Ambavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to ambabor plasma plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Ambuavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for the carcinogenicity in mice and rats, with male animals benigne hepatellular Adenome with doses to which the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to people, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg Ambavir, said.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatoellular Adenome and Karzinome was not yet clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application, however, some evidence for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro gene tests, the bacterial reverse test tests (Ames test), mouse-lymphoma test, micro-core test in rats and chromosome test test to human peripheral lymphocytes was amelivir neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, clinical studies have no significant liver toxicity in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerase even after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in young men, who were treated with an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality rate, both at the age of 4 and with ambavir animals.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however, it was also measured its effectiveness (by reducing its effect in relation to reducing the gag concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyms lowered the gag concentrations in the urine around 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyms in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardie (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be applied in patients who may not react strongly (allergic) to Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update every year all new information that may be announced, and to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyms will receive patients who are preserved Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission awarded the Genzyme Europe B.V., a approval for the placing of Aldurazyms throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using cho-mammals (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is to treat patients with verified diagnosis of a Mucysacchariot I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a doctor, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can increase if the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyms treated patients can develop infusion reactions, which are defined as any of the side effect that occurs during infusion or by the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be supervised, and the infusion of Aldurazyms should only be made in an adequate clinical environment, where revitalisation facilities available for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected to form nearly all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution by Aldurazyms with caution (see section 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because of course, there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer breaks, the risk provisioning has to be cautious because of the theoretically increased risk reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or anti-locking) to minimize the potential occurrence infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or medium-severe infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / isbuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate, which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, heavy infusion reaction, the infusion must be stopped, until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / isbuprofen is to consider.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies are not shown on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that were exponated opposite Laronidase over the breast milk is recommended, is not recommended during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were primarily classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug interactions associated with Aldurazyms, which were observed during the phase 3 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are common in the following table following the following sorts: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in the history, too, heavy reactions occurred, including Bronchospasmus, respiratory failure and facial expressions (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects associated with Aldurazyms, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5, with mainly severe displacement and treatment duration of up to 12 months, reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, it came to a serokonversion within 3 months after the treatment of a serokonversion, with a severe delay form mostly within one month (average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study) were found in 13 / 45 patients no by radioimmunoburzipation (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, among them 3 patients with which it never came to serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low anti-physical levels are a robust reduction in the gag mirror in Harn, while in patients with high antibody titres, a variable reduction of gag at Harn was found.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal up to low neutralising material effect on the enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies appeared not in connection with the incidence of undesired medicine actions, even when the occurrence of undesired drug reactions typically fell along with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for the enzyme-sales therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrate and preventing a further accumulation of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and cells into the lynosomes, most likely about Mannosis-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were recorded, the majority of patients from the Middle phenotype, and only one patient proved the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcased expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 metres.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study where she received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme compared to the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the inability to be shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintenance of this effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically significant over this period, and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportional to the body size growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomic fact, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear trash of the gag-mirror was found in the Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) that remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients who has been reflected by using a combined end point, the clinically significant changes of the shoulder-bearing (TRI and visual acuity) was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">It was conducted an open-year phase 2 study carried out primarily the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe breast form and 4 with medium-form form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dose of increased GAG- mirror was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size reduction (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined after the Z score for these age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the medium-run form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with severe displacement form (&lt; 2.5 years), whereas in the older patients with severe displacement form only limited or no progress made in the cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study tests on the codynamic effects of various Aldurazyma dosing schematics were performed on the gag-mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent the difficulties with weekly infusions, but it is not proved that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schematics is equivalent to.</seg>

<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed in its active form is easier to outfit in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations in the active form of the drug and a longer term effect in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Alimta was examined in a major study to 456 patients who had not yet received chemotherapy against their disease before.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were treated in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (a different medicines against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), and both in combination with Cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for the use in children under 18 years due to non-sufficient data for integrity and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, patients with a cancer-inin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose of dose necessary to go beyond the recommended dose adjustment for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a cancer-inin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a limitation of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper bilirubin- limit value and / or transiinasenue values &gt; the 3.0 times of the upper limit value (at intervals of liver metastasis) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (in presence of liver metastasis) are not specifically examined in studies.</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrality number, throcybocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">Less toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and niotic toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutrropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia, if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed patients need to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure of reducing toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous infusion of non-steroid antiphic acid (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and minors (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients receiving treatment with Pemetremixed is to avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-value for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with which these events occurred, had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, existing blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>

<seg id="2402">Therefore, be careful when in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are used in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicyllic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and minimally, 2 days after the therapy with Pemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding intershareholders with NSAIDs with a long semi-value as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the same application must be avoided with Pemetremixed for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre-.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and antineoplasty chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International normalization ratio), when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anticoagulants.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetikum).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended, since the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy, compared to 57% of the patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">With chemotherapists, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy, and 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the distribution of Aloxi in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe emetogenic chemotherapy, due to a cancer disease and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding one before the Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colorectal, patients with anamnesty Obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection can be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 anti-antagonists, caution is provided with the simultaneous gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or that tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemotherapist, Aloxi is supposed to be used for treating nausea and vomiting in the days following the chemotherapy treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five examined Chemotherapy activity (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-static metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxetine, Chinidine, Ranitidine, Ritonavir, Serralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the use of Palonosetron in human gestions are not necessary, therefore Palonosetron should not be used for pregnant women, unless it is necessary to treat the treatment doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of survival reactions and reactions at the administration location (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar properties of adverse events were found as in the other dosing groups; no dose-response relationships were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis trials carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably no effective therapy at a alxi- overturn.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 mg / m2 cisplatin, ≤ 1500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide, and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mcg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mcg / m2 Doxorubicine (half-value 7.3 hours) received, which was given to Day 1 without Dexamethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 microgram Palonosetron were treated with patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were assigned to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of severe emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical trials, Palonosetron owns the ability to block the Ionenkanels and Repolarisation of the Ionenkanels and extend the duration of the shareholder.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. affected Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to an initial decrease in Plasmakonzentrations follow a slow elimination of plasma concentrations from the body with an average terminale half of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportionally in the total dose of 0,3- 90 m / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous pallets of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average median (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Out of pharmacokinetic simulations goes out that at once daily intravenous intravenous of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposition (AUC0- ∞), the Cmax was up to 0.75 mg higher after one-time intravenous administration; however, the Cmax was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys, and about another 50% are transformed into two primary metabolism, compared to Palonosetron above less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in lower dimensions, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 at the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">According to a unique intravenous bolt, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function problems, the terminale of elimination of elimination time and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction in dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, only after expositions were observed, which are considered adequate over the maximum of human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 from pre-clinical studies revealed that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionenkanals, which can be involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can extend the shareholders of shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (every dose corresponded in approximately the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure when people), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasmen (in thyroid gland, hypophysis, pancreas, trinierenmark) and skin tumors at rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses of dosages and since Aloxi is intended for one-time application, the relevance of these results will be low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Human Papers (CHMP) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C has been recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection-solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should be resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same envirally effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon was to be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long lasting) Hepatitis C (one through viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic study the liver tissue damage damage, and the values of the liver enzymes Alandeaminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) has been incorporated, which stimulates this to the formation of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon placed data that prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferone-A (active structure, composition, and purity of pharmaceuticals, effectiveness, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of the reference training.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was applied to the medication (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Moreover, concerns have been expressed concern that data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the marketing of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C which spoke on the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon flamed the disease in more patients than the reference drug; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from being used in the study, the drug examines an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with crucifixation) and small infected Lazerations (Riss- or Schnittwunden), strain and tensioned wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Alclogo should not be used for the treatment of infections, which were detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistente Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo is not effective against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface should not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and draw alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works through blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterienzelle, where proteins are produced) and inhibits growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main indicative of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was rejected by the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of the 71 patients receiving placebo said to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hautwinkle, Altargo and Cefalexin had similar contacts: when the results of both studies were merged in Hautwinkle, about 90% of the patients were enrolled in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, that Altargo was found in the treatment of abscans (eitful cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were detectable or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the customer's office.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee of Humanity (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo in the short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections regarding the risks of superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, depreciation or seperate wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the market launch of Altargo in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, where within two to three days no improvement is shown, should be examined once again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of Sensibilisation or heavy local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is to be canceled, the ointment will be carefully checked and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections such as Erreger is known or suspects (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical trials with secondary open wounds was the effectiveness of retinapamulin in patients with infections that caused by a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which have been reached in people after topical application to topical skin, or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibitor in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral care of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the average Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% retinapamulin obe on the poor skin of healthy adult men around 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low system exposure to topical use in patients, Dosiscustomizations are not required to be required if topical Retapamulin was used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the flexal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy, when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In case of decision whether the breastfeeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo is continued, is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of alclogo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies on 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have been applied to Altargo, the most commonly reported side effect of irritation on the administration site, which consider about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of operation Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pantromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a particular binding of the 50s lower unit of the bacterial Ribosomes, which differs from the obligations of other ribosomal intermittent antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the Binder Bank is involved in the ribosomales Protein L3 and is located in the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferral centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding point, Pandromutiline inhibiting the peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal education of active 50s ribosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the use of the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retapamulin at least some infection forms should appear, an advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in vitro activity of retinapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults was put 1% retinapamulin obe daily under occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retinapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sample removal was carried out in days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the median and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systematic recording of people according to topical use of 1% Salbe on 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microsomen has been communicated primarily by CYP3A4, under minor participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro review on genetic mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-micro-test for in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither in male still with female rats signs of reduced fertilarity with oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest estimated exposure of people (topical application on 200 cm2) has been eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats were ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development of development (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of approval for the domestic demand must ensure that an pharmacovigilance system, such as in the module 1.8.1, is present and works before the product is marketed as long as the product market is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The proprietor of approval for the distribution plan is obliged to perform in detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management scheme (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for Human use," the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time with the next periodic safety update report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">To show irritation or other signs and symptoms of the treated place, you should end the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other salaries, creams or lotions on the area that is treated with Altargo if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the sage looks up on one of these areas, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor to help if any complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After entering the Salbe, you can cover the affected area with a sterilen bandage or a Gazeverband, unless your doctor got to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic seal that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of sage, or in an aluminium bag, which contains 0.5 g of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two doses of existing vaccinations, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix only may be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, that consists of two doses taken to an end to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a reling dose against hepatitis A or B is requested, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines seem to teach by the immune system (the body defense of the body), "as it can resist a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix adults and the Twinrix children registered since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used for protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered in the context of one from three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data which support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicative for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a month after the last injection of a protective antibody concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop anti-physical concentration against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that ambient temperature was similar to ambient and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetite, pain at the injector, redness, matiness (tiredness) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to the active ingredients (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted the Company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a permit for the distribution of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the basic dosing with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, with the first dose of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refreshment is requested for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, the vaccines can be vaccinated with the respective monovalent vaccines or with a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis B virus observed in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immunosities, which have addressed to a hepatitis A vaccination, possibly require a refresher than protection since it may also be protected by immunologic memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections vaccines should be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine, corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization valve is recommended that the 360 ELISA unit formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen contains.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hemoralysis patient and persons with disturbances in the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibody value is achieved, so in these cases the gift of additional vaccinations can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since a intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal vaccination, this injection should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of throcybocytopenie or blood clots, Ambirix cannot be injected as an exception in these cases after intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the form of a combined diphtheri-, tetanus and haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or combined with a combined masern- mumps vaccine was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunochemical therapy or patients with immunodeficiency disease, it may be assumed that no sufficient immunodeficiency may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination boxes of this formulation, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matitis, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier thiomerisation and preservative vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 - including 15 years, the tolerability of ambient rix were compared to the 3-dosing combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher Frequency of Pain and Maternity on a calculation base per vaccination: Ambirix, but not on a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed according to the gift of Ambirix with 59.1% of the subjects compared to 39.1% of the subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects that Ambirix were given, over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects that were vaccinated with the 3-dose planting material.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matthfulness was comparable high (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received ambient rix, compared with 36.2% of the subjects who received the 3-doses combination stockings).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of impregnable pain and mateness was low and comparable to the combination of the combination of the combined vaccine with the 3-doses ocschema.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study of 1- up to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general strikes in the Ambient group was comparable to the hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a common occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per band.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines which schematified over heavy side effects during the 2-cans of vaccinations with the combined hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment was statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials which were carried out at vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 months old dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 received the standard combined cycle with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">At 289 individuals whose immunity was payable, the oprotection rates (SP in table below) were significantly higher compared with Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose-material significantly higher than Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparison study group 1 to 11-year-olds each month after the ending of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines received either a 2-cans vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA-units formalininactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were at the time of the Gruner Period between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies were detected for at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in 0-6 months inclinschema.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response was comparable to both antigens against both antigens comparable to the vaccine production of 3 doses, consisting of 360 ELISA-units formalininactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study near 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies were comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months of vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix is administered at the same time with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus and 8 sharemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined mask-mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults, showed similar seroprotection and serokonversionrates as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both prior to examine and / or physical visible changes in both cases and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">Like all vaccines, Ambirix not completely protect against infection with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected / your child in front of both vaccinations Ambirix already infected with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus (although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel) a vaccination may not prevent any disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that cause liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can't be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can cause asthma attacks, breathing need or swelling of your face or tongue. • If with you / your child once an allergic reaction has occurred to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly create a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the conventions of the second vaccination uptake).</seg>
<seg id="2785">In a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it is recommended to give you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content in an inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination uptake of this vaccine is usually administered a month after the first dose, and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before the termination of the vaccine production.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected with people who are injected due to severe blood clots, suffer from skin and not in muscle tissue. • If you / your child are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your body's own defense / or if you / your child may undergo a hemoralysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to the vaccination is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Please note your doctor if you receive further medicine / take care (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription), or if you have been vaccinated without (antibodies) / or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have been given, or that is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It can be, however, that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine, therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible as different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">When Ambirix is given to the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Normally, Ambirix sanging or lactating women is not given, except it is urgently needed to be vaccinated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you already showed an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packages with 1 and 10 with or without needles and packs up to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since issuing the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP has shown that the benefit-risk ratio for ambient rix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix not only been placed in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medication is limited to the low patient position.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzymes or hyperammonium encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonium concentration).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is divided - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed up, blended under the food or via a gastrostomieschke (by the stomach-ceiling in the stomach-leading tube) or a nose probe (caused by the nose into the stomach-leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because Ammonaps cannot be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo medicine that could be compared with active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also cause loss of appetite, an abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid disorders, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee of Humanity (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients with disruptions of the urinary cycle of high Ammonites are effective.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the selector of the disease at the time of approval, only limited information regarding this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme Q10 has already manifested in newborage (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifested form (incomplete enzymes manifest, which is manifested after the first life of life) there is an indication of use when in the history of hyperammonite encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallow disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and development of the patient's necessary daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight over 20 kg, as well as with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Patients who suffer from an early manifested deficiency of carbamylphosphate synase or ornithindylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a non-inosuccinatsynase deficiency must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given patients with canary disorders, as a risk for origination of Ösophagusulzera exists if the tablets are not immediately entered into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congenital heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and ecattainment of clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolisation and separation of sodium phenylbutyat is carried out via the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with liver or kidney insufficiency only with external caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous injection of phenylacacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowing of neuronal deterioration and a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a handicap of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noticed whether phenylacetic was eliminated in human breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the breastfeeding period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS entered at least 56% of patients at least one undesired event (AE) and 78% of these undesired events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) has been reported by an 18-year-old anoretical patient who developed an metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lacacia tin, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose resulted in a 5-month old little child with a special dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phenylacacetate, which showed intravenous dosotoxicity in a intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetic is a metabolic active connection, conjugated by acetylacetylglutamine by acetylacetylglutamine by acetylacetic.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Sturometrically seen phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to remove excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram genomic sodium phenylbutyat between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the disease associated with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was formerly inflically, and the disease induced himself with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogs within the first life year of death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemoralysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen dehydrate (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacate), proteins reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of neutered at post-partal (but within the first life-month) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and patients were treated before the first appearance of hyperammonite encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with many of mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifested form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotes form of the ornithindylase deficiency) that were recovered from a hyperammonium encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyat and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacidate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyfish and its metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained according to a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyat in sober healthy adults and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous in sodium phenylbutyat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyat in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclical disorders or hemoggloopathies, according to different doses of phenylbutyat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no phenylacate in plasma was detectable.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyat had no clavable effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either oral (infants and children who are not able to swallow any tablets or patients with swallow disorders) or via a gastrostomieschlo or a nostrils.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight over 20 kg, as well as with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins should be kept within the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">Patients who suffer from an early manifested deficiency of carbamylphosphate synase or ornithindylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyat, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat burgers were suspended before the birth of Phenylacetic (active metaboo of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramids cells of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) has been reported by an 18-year-old anoretical patient who developed an metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lacacia tin, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Sturometrically seen phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to remove surplus excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of tests on the excavation of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances in the urinary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of genomic sodium phenylbutyat between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a oral dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyat in Granular form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the completed product only for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this case, the small measuring spoon 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phenylbutyat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must have received the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyat amounts to 5 grams in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they can not withdraw the nitrogen-based waste products based on consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If there are laboratory studies, you must inform the doctor that you can take AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyat influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding time, you should not take AMMONAPS to overtake the medicine into the breast milk and could harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste problems, disturbances of obedience, disorientiousness, memory problems, and deterioration of existing neurological states were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find one of these symptoms, put yourself immediately with your doctor or with the notion of your hospital in conjunction with a corresponding treatment in connection.</seg>

<seg id="2876">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS distributed in the same single doses or via a gastric fistle (hose which runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (hose, which is led by the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a chopped measuring spoon Granules. • Take a straight edge, e.g. a measuring speed over the upper edge of the knife to remove excess granules. • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon Granules from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with "acute coronarsyndroms" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different starch) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "St- Hebung" (an abnormal measurement value of electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox used to prevent blood clots in patients applied to a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with angina or heart failure to maintain blood flow towards the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angioxein or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, a different medicine for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI patients often used a stent (a short tubes that remains in the arteries to prevent a clasp), and they also received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, cardiac cases or reascularization) after 30 days or a year in a total of just as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who have undergone a PCI, Angiox was equally effective as Hepine, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients who possibly are sensitive (allergic) against Bivalerudin, other miludine or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must also be used in patients who had recently a bleeding, as well as people with heavy hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Humanity (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Angiox in the ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable replacement for Hepparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission awarded the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd, a approval for the market launch of Angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (instabile Angina / non-ST-Hebdo) when an emergency engagement or an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If in the second consecutive row a PCI is performed, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be included for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg will be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a sole bolt of angiox was not investigated and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened at a maximum of 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstitutive and diluted medicines should be carefully selected and administered rapidly intravenously before application.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another surveillance is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg Infusion dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney disease (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (if treated with Bivalerudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg can be payed and tested the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which included in phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which were included, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalerudin-Bolus without dosing adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3. patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients is angiox contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be conducted 30 minutes after the termination of the intravenous in unfractionated Heparine or 8 hours after the end of the subcutaneous formulation of Heparine.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• more known hypersensitivity to the active substance or other components or increased blood risk due to a disturbance of hemostatic system and / or irreversibly bacterial endocardiditis. • heavier kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully tested in terms of symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in PCI patients live among biopsies in most cases of arterial points, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during the treatment in principle of bleeding everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are using warfarin and treated with Bivalerudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International normalized Ratio) should be implemented in order to ensure that the value of the treatment with bivalerudin will be achieved once again before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregationshemmer), it can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalerudin with throcybocytes aggregates or anticoagulants are the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters in any case regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experiments are inadequate in terms of the impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, reduction or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalerudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalerudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalerudin group and patients who were treated with Hepparin was more common in women and patients over 65 years, more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy hemorrhages were defined according to ACUITY and Timi's standards for heavy bleeding as defined in table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both slight as well as heavy hemorrhage occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with Hepatic plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular blood-reflection of ≥ 4 g / dx without obvious blood pressure, reduction of hemostatic reflection of ≥ 3 g / dL with known blood pressure, reoperation due to a bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localiations that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" Punishment, retroperitoneal, gastroses, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalerudin in 6,000 patients who undergone a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalerudin Group, as well as in the patients treated with Heppic groups, was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both slight as well as heavy bleeding came in significantly less often than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported according to comprehensive use in practice and are arranged according to system organic classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose the treatment with Bivalerudin immediately break out and to monitor the patient engmeshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombindings, which binds both at the Catalytic center as well as at the Anionenbination region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is tied in the liquid phase or at Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The liaison of Bivalerudin on Thrombin, and with its effect is reversible because Thrombin saddressing the binding of Bivalerudin Arg3-Pro4, whereby the function of the active centre of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalerudin with serum for patients who had come in the past to heparininduced thrombocytopenie / heparininduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) was induced no thromboocytes reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalerudin shows a dosing and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect that is assigned by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If there was a PCI in the patient below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg bivalerudin was given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the Arm A of the ACUITY study, infractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered according to relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronartery syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST-Hebdo (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the start of angiography (at the time of the boundary) or at the PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes, which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or upper arm, or administered as continuous fusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not have enough insulin for the regulation of glucose (sugar) in the blood, or the insulin can not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very marginally of human insulin and the change means that it operates faster and shorter life time than a short-effective Humanism.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type 2 diabetes where the insulin does not work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicative for the effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance glycemylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes after six months, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% with insulin lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who are potentially sensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or one of the other ingredients, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra must be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can effect on blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH an approval for the market launch of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection, either in the area of abdominal ceiling, or subcutaneous injections or subcutaneous in the area of the pancreas.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin treatment, insulin requirement may be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the impact strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, inkdelay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of operation may take a change of insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosing or the demolition of a treatment, in particular in patients with insulin requiring diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and an diabetic ketoazide; these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient on a different insulin type or insulin any other manufacturer should be done under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of a hypoglycemia depends on the effect of the insulin injections and can therefore change the schemas when changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances which enhance blood glucose levels, antidiabetic acid, angioxetine, fibrate, oxetine, monoamine-oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphen, alizylate and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics, such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine, and reserves the symptoms of adrenergen antigents might be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductive-icity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and Humanism regarding the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulins occur in human breast milk, but generally, insulin does not occur in or into breast milk, nor is resorously absorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following are from clinical trials known, adverse medicines are listed, sorted by system organic classes and are frequent: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is failed to continuously change the injection unit within the injection range, can occur in a row of lipodystrophy on injection.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with loss of loss can be treated by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 - 1 mg), which is given by a physician or administered by intravenous medication by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucoagoninject, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose levels (especially due to skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibiting of glucose in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin lulism occurs faster and the duration of time is shorter than with hu- manem normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin in therapeutic doses of 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a proportional glucose monitoring effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more, a proportional increase of the glucose-cosmic effect, just like humanism.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect of action such as normal humanism and achieves a complete glucose-cosmic effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was clearly seen that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-pranational glycaemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, 30 minutes before the meal is given.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meals, it has been achieved a better post-pranational control than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is applied for 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control of the meal is given (see Figure 1), a comparable glycemic control of the meal is reached (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin for gift 2 minutes (previously) before the start of meal in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to humankind normal levels (NORMAL - before) was given before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisine in gift 15 minutes (after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human norms), which was given 2 minutes before the start of the meal (Figure 1C) before the start of the meal.</seg>
