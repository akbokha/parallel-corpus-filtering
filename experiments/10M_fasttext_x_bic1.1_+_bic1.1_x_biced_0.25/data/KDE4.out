the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its low size , they provide some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by adding this easier available .
for further information on the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the Hand@@ book &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load this modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings ... open the card card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the K@@ DE package ; please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package .
in order to use the crash module , click on the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of stor@@ my if present , del@@ eting .
the cartridge filter module ( also called folder filters ) can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with ex@@ tras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current labour directory on different kind of filters .
to view the DO@@ M tree control in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , for example : the element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ types of this root element .
the module &amp; FS@@ View module ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects using the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to check the contents of your local file system .
the specific@@ ity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , tel@@ ted folder size with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each item is represented by a rectangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or file size , the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries is defined . in this way , large files can be easily detected , even if they can be seen far below in the folder hier@@ archy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched on color mode , it can be either depth for the easy detection of cas@@ ket depth , or the illustration of another file association as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can define whether they are displayed at all , or if there is enough space for displaying the sign of sub@@ ordin@@ arily , or if there is enough space for the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . moreover , you can define the relative position of the labelling in rectangle .
when algorith@@ ms algorith@@ ms should be observed , the surface is proportional to the size of this entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target will not always be held . it will be shown that less space is lost for the frame , if the square is square .
as distribution of the area &apos;s area takes place to the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be left . here it is for labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses due to the frame , that rec@@ tan@@ gles can be created , which are possible to be square . the best methods of this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive second allocation .
you can define the minimal base area for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the higher resolution , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rin@@ d .

&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with base working tools . you can use this to evaluate your photos , evaluate and correct . editing functions can be easily expanded with the K@@ DE Image Plu@@ gins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ plug is ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management . workflow .
improved database with significantly more met@@ ad@@ ata such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; K@@ DE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ plug ; an open source project . that means it &apos;s on the support of En@@ dan@@ wen@@ s . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; tries to make the mil@@ king of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you use this link , your web browser will open a page in the error message system . all required information are already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; is a project supported by one community . if you come to a regular user from &amp; digi@@ plug ; ask here questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ plug ; ask , and hopefully soon to ask questions of other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be more powerful than you should be powerful .
you can also see the digi@@ plug ; homepage visit to learn news about liber@@ ally versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ plug ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ plug ; is the registration in the developer mailing list . instruction to report in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ plug ; for the first time , you will be asked where to specify your pictures and your database . you can simply specify arrow keys or click the folder symbol folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local file on your computer . this path is stored for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders such as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ plug ; additionally , you will also use as al@@ der library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as basic folder . &amp; digi@@ plug ; considers any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the passage of the folder you will get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ ous ; dur@@ o stim@@ ulates the library of the library in its whole depth . you can &apos;t leave sub@@ folder , unless it came in a clo@@ cked folder . this allows you to add extraordinary &amp; digi@@ plug ; perform a point before the name of the board .
if you take a existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have photos as icons . this will then be used as an album symbol . this will then be used as an album symbol . further details will be found in the section albums .
once you recon@@ figured the basic folder , you can check your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to manage my albums and my sample box to manage your photos in the albums .
raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera so you can handle it ; probably the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ support .
how to do this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h @-@ Work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera station will be available to you with your digital camera and supports your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and any card readers , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) is used for the actual transmission of the machine . the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for digital cameras , which is a constantly expanding number of digital cameras supporting digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for its communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers about the serial port are now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and runs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support provided to read the presentation images of the digi@@ K@@ am reliably . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you could possibly consult anything or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things attached to &amp; digi@@ plug ; is how easy to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plu@@ gins interface Project ( manual ) is a joint venture structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to supplement &amp; digi@@ plug ; by writing a small module to complement one function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ plug ; even carry out .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either change the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
the pull and off of images works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , via the horizontal separation line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be found in keyword , file list or search .
- a file selection allows you to recover the more common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , Movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields which are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filtering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind is displayed as a symbol view . which fields are displayed in the dialog box .

what is a digital stock administration - away from the fashion point ? any part of the process that follows the picture has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage space . each of the photos taken , sc@@ anned or digital photographs keeps the form of digital stock administration through . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to backup your pictures , protect , protect and print photos . we look forward to downloading , ren@@ aming , backup , backup , backup , viewing , waiting , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management is based on inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , trans@@ duc@@ ed , conden@@ sed and exported contents to a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data , information about or a documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you don &apos;t know more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t know yet how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t know &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to store both in a database as well as in the image files , very fast searching and secure archi@@ ving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you have to maintain something in your system . your image files must somehow save on your computer , whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you need to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday images can be quickly found on your location . if you were interested in one year several times the same place . if you &apos;re using enough photos , then you &apos;ll be able to print folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . you can then print a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of the archives and 5 % work@@ files will not be organizing and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the installation page of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ plug ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently store the met@@ ad@@ ata out of the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? it shows &amp; digi@@ plug ; to them a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work begins , as you need to select any photo words , labelling and an evaluation . of course you can choose all images that will need the same attribute and then set the value then . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let us now be able to proceed with keyword , key words , as you can proceed in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catal@@ og@@ ged images from another source with embedded images , then it &apos;s not a problem and can simply insert the images to the right spot . the changes of the hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can simply move through the pull of a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are taken from &amp; digi@@ plug ; updated while the under@@ line is followed .
the graphics displays like different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very rough representation , because each block of met@@ ad@@ ata consists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to catal@@ og@@ ze your met@@ ad@@ ata .
they want to just let them see your photos only , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your pictures .
check out this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , memories , the historical time span is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the lab@@ eling has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself . if you show images , you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive which you understand what you understand .
it &apos;s ok if a picture is not perfect , if the strength is only with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can also save a lot of text in an international alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE will even export it to your wishes to the labelling and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system . you will have to tell the history so for the opening process .
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find out into another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation is now already with light speed .
the possibilities for ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already inn@@ umer@@ able , and will be able to virtually repeat that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat the photos at the recording location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ plug came to :
author ( syn@@ onym for author and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the identity of photographers , then the name of a company or organization is not changed . this field does not support com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( syn@@ onym for the author ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples of this can be the title , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a publisher of the car , it must be completed as well .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ d@@ eter@@ feld to identify who needs . this must not be sure to be the author , such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then you can see the picture another . if the photo is a bearing picture , then the group / agency will see the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they can do no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work can do this , in the image of your photos only of small interest . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important against it .
the digital water@@ mark is unique . &amp; digi@@ plug is in the near future , a module for the st@@ acking processing is provided .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the street or a fire . this type of losses are the same that you can also happen with traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which have a loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must also be treated more than a few years . of course you can also get CDs and DVDs into archive quality , you can get more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 pieces that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe it is in your measuring room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can store good dis@@ ks and good recording devices and do not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you have a lot more reliable than the cheapest , so you can choose to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you have just been written only . because of this massive protection we are needed for form@@ atting and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they are needed for form@@ atting , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ b@@ ster that seems to works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged flo@@ ppy disks , hard disks , Flash@@ media , USB drive systems etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to store the For@@ mat@@ war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store up to 50 GB , thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . of course , everything about CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected location . do not forget the data to read the next generation of media and software that can read this media .
dis@@ band@@ ages retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a large field study on the mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ belief
in brief : dis@@ ks keep the longest if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature control the error should not determine the most common errors . some of the SM@@ ART errors will fail to announce the immediate failure . these are particularly Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and shift counter . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is the case for the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to an electric shock before you have saved the files , but these losses are usually removed without any major problems .
while most electric devices don &apos;t make much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hardware switch , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself before the inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against rapi@@ ds is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs an aspect of energy and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug bar . however , do not think any connector bar also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it protects against lightning bolt and protects the devices correctly .
since a over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should also make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers are also available for telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and the television card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for the road .
while over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it can not really help you . even a failure of few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ load these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power loss occurs . some models allow them to continue to work up to the electricity again . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as a over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
concern the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety with the cost of avo@@ idance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be given you up to &amp; euro ; 40 , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a little price difference if you think it &apos;s always safe to tr@@ ash before you drive into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a backup under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantity of data .
they are compared to the hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send data on the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online storage services . your free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year , you will get unlimited memory , which should be checked only in reality .
from the point of view of data protection , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ably safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the integrity of the operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ noticed that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocols is a much more secure data way than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable grid parts are another source for transmission lu@@ sts , because they produce interference within the data streams . these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still the alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms as well and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % at work systems . at not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
loss of data loss due to viruses is less common than most . it leads to a lower damage , for example , theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; it has been no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less due to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . a very good English article here will find you here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investigation process in sudden dis@@ ruption is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the largest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is that while the technology continued to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is already deterior@@ ated for compact cameras and the final results are the optimization for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive is now available for 100 &amp; euro ; so you are no longer affected by any data loss . so you can make sure your data often be affected by a plan and test this backup before you can make any more dangerous than the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange plates or change of hard drives .
suppose you do daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you , if the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget the aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect all the space or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ lection means a non @-@ local storage . bring your safety up the stairs to the neighbouring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already said is a more common reason for a loss of data loss . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be backed up . this is a moment of time without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : backup of the files changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete moment of time for two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
in@@ kre@@ ment@@ ary backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . this backup can restore the original status at any time again . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception that it is closed and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer tran@@ scripts to only change the difference of files that really changed . this happens to be compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
ass@@ ure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another op@@ tically medium .
this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore again . at the same time you come for a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a moment of departure for each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done , after which you have a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC data , associated , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visible devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about the period of time in which you are really interested in you because you remember your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you have to consider and re @-@ evaluate while the time goes . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to use as the current system backward . if less variants you have used in the past , the more easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increase .
let &apos;s go out that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and put it on a new record :
check the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them .
= / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; Dollars ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ ER ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; Dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rice FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format dis@@ appears the slowly from the market . it should therefore no longer be used .
P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard designed for GIF . but it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ city data for improved colour transfer information , but not as many as T@@ IFF needs and a slow compression . this format we would recommend you to save your pictures .
T@@ IFF was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IFF can store images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open resource format that is designed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is based on the T@@ IFF / EP format and is obliged to use a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer D@@ NG is now available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is probably one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is available with the expansion &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer it before an original of your recording , mostly in the shell format , for archi@@ ving . X@@ MP is fit to edit the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . but it can also be noticed by the link between the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file . so you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and place all there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards . the D@@ CM@@ I @-@ communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fy efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your shell archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
for a sensitive work you can use external programs . if you come back the images again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut off under circumstances of other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright law with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section adding a photos to an album , you can add a description of how you can already add on your hard drive . however , the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ ate bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect these with the computer , turn the camera on display mode and switch them . another description will be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is manufactured , a fer@@ oci@@ ous indicator is displayed at the bottom , and the presentation images of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , file names and a symbol for file association settings will appear for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to download the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a details and its met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialogue shows file characteristics and the photo information attached to the intern@@ ally of the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded from your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the met@@ ad@@ ata met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer , GPS , etc. of the picture . these information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or the image processing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available with some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then download the selection from your camera into one single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in downloading the photos are not deleted , and we recommend you to check if the pictures can be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the selected optional features of &amp; K@@ DE ; as soon as you select the photos , use the button to download and then choose the selected files . the button chosen is as long as you chose some photos .
if your camera supports this is an option New download . these pictures have been downloaded until now not &amp; digi@@ plug ; in this case , the new pictures with a star in front window is marked . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you can download or download the buttons all or selected files , a dialog box will appear in which the photos are stored . the list of existing records will be displayed as normal ste@@ aling . select the list of existing albums , then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you select the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you &apos;ve downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . if you want to delete the button delete all . if you only want to delete a few , you must select this first and then delete del@@ e@@ tion chosen .
please note that there are no possibility of making photos that you deleted from the camera . you should not be careful if you want to delete the photos successfully in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should make sure that this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful , after you upload photos of various recording criteria into the same album , so it can be useful to integrate the date and time to integrate the image in which the image was made , into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and reflec@@ tions of the picture and for data bases . if you use this latter option , automatically generate a folder per day .
the options While the transmission opens three more options to be carried out before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another file format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option &amp; time to add . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the commands .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ames option , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters , or if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name , which the camera is available in the preview . your settings are stored and automatically used , if you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; Wa@@ it ; can you use any information on the camera to the timing of the camera to perform an automatic turning during the sub@@ jection . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section of side bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo .
automatic turning is normally switched on , and when your camera fails to deliver this information , the photo can be turned off , use the button Extended and select the automatic turning in the lower part of the window .
if your camera has been made information about the date that the photo was made available , it can be done &amp; digi@@ plug . all images with the same date are based on the image data . not all cameras are available in the same time . not all cameras make this information available . in the section of side bar met@@ a data you can read which information your camera could have embedded into the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case you can install &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button Advanced and select the file @-@ based underground lower at the lower end of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their machine to your camera is the button to download . select the file extension dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can choose to select the files you want to upload . you can also choose more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the picture selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , where the pictures are uploaded . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is meant as a general term used in this document . this is a position meant to be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude . identi@@ fying data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo , or any other system .
not only for professional photographs , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to extract an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environment plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot where the photo was done , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users just want to locate the site , or simply add this aspect , it &apos;s good to en@@ rich the position data of a photo .
the question is , how are the GPS data in the picture ? first you should know that Ex@@ iv@@ 2 includes a lot of GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and maps . directly with the right hardware , via editing the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a couple who work with GPS receiver . either as card module or transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but you need to save these data in GP@@ X format , because it is the only format to support the geographical Position module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign @-@ on coordinates that are created by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .

you can select a preview on embedded preview or image processing . you will put the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; firm if you click on a entry in the main view .

Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the editor of the photographer : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be a freelance photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , it must be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to set up the photo . this must not be the author , as such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then this organisations should be entered here as such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , and then the picture must be a warehouse , then the group or agency will be the image available here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently included in the picture and not only entered in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug ; these met@@ ad@@ ata is also available other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be imported without being lost .
image labelling as embedded sha@@ des ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your pictures with the pictures of the pictures . attention : in pictures that already contain labelling , these are over@@ written by the digi@@ plug ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all the options for information that appear if the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window above a file rests . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and audio formats . to determine which file types and digi@@ plug ; show , you can add the file extension of this list and remove . any file in one &amp; digi@@ plug ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which is no one of these extensions , will be ignored .
the default settings can be reset , by pressing the button on the right from each category .
the settings of the lighthouse of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode . however , you should only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode ; if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can switch off the tool@@ bar if you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ lying areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors can be specified here . in image processing it can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , the images can be encoded into a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the near Declaration .
using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG requires a fast calcul@@ ator . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means a low and 9 high compression .
the T@@ IFF file can be compressed using the T@@ IFF file . this reduces the size of T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF images . it has no influence on the image quality because the default algorithm uses loss @-@ free .
with the adjustment los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save losses loss . even if you have been written loss of loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , image editing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default settings are that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option with a minimal loss of details , this is a bit soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option shows the image a bit soft , elimin@@ ates but the 2x@@ 2 sample pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white @-@ balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic balance balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white @-@ balance is not set . standard , it is a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors , the effect of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ lined images will get more details in the top @-@ ups . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your pictures are embedded in the settings . use the setting of h@@ itting white in the settings . in addition , you can solve some unusual results because they can re@@ construct the sh@@ lich@@ ter in various ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . last , you can try some of the missing information from the sh@@ re@@ alities .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast satisfied like green and red . &amp; gt ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still not filled blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adapted for each image separately .
put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you &apos;ll probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be taken later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ image editing will be too small to keep you conservative .
a demo process algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the part @-@ filtered image sensor that provide many cameras and that a matrix colour is available . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
the digi@@ plug @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive hom@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity ) was created . after some tests it was created as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . but it produces colour art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenti@@ ls , you can place the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color reduction correction , since you will be carried out during the resource conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates into color information and returns instructions like this again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information such as color information from a color space in the other are so accurate as possible .
question questions , if an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile S@@ lay here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / user or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; exam@@ ines this folder during the Star@@ ts .
settings of the ICC profiles You have the ability &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to rear . everything can change during opening the raw file later .
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are just your pictures color administ@@ ers not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model you can use . not all profiles are created on the same way . currently d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not apply for conver@@ sions at 16 @-@ bit depth . this means you need to carry out the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your printer would have a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are very satisfied with you . this could be manually correct instead of running on the blind algorithm .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles fit together . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the objective : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plu@@ gin Interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; image viewer and image processing is supported . through the release of this interface , &amp; digi@@ plug ; many modules have been written to cooperate with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you &apos;ll see a list of available modules . select the modules that will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the Pre@@ view .
short command for tasks that are carried out by modules can design@@ ate short command in the menu .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the le@@ ak@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjusted the time between the image trans@@ itions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other buttons switch on the met@@ ad@@ ata , respectively , which are burned at the bottom of the pictures during the display .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all the cameras supported on the left side . if you want to use a camera connected to the computer , you know that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in picture display mode . these are currently serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path to US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / ga@@ ze , specify when you hang your camera .
to use your digital camera with digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , put them in the display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after having set up your camera , your camera appears in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . in the menu cameras of the main window are displayed . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option confirmation dialog for re@@ loc@@ ating &gt; images in the tr@@ ash cans , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album , you can find more details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ plug ; otherwise , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without back in@@ qu@@ eries . otherwise , you must apply changes to the button changes .
you can also add the indication of the welcome panel of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in sub@@ types , it can accelerate the starting line of &amp; digi@@ plug ;
the setting up to new photos search for new photos . this extended the start time according to new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the starting time of &amp; digi@@ plug ; if something comes from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , whether it should delete it from the database .
different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; used to adjust the main window to suit your taste . this settings can choose from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug , please find further information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these images to view and improve your photos and to the correction of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the updated advertis@@ ements / Edit .
the image machining contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . so , some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; for example , you are not part of your distribution . further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be set in section image processing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magni@@ fying factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for fast access to the most common features .
the editing functions change your photos . however , the functions will change the original photo before you can save the file saving or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo anymore once you have stored the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your picture before you can change it . you can save with file save as well .
as long as you have not stored the photo , you can restore the original image to restore from the menu file and restore the button to restore the image editing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have performed at the photo since the last Save .
virtually every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed and restored . the final action can be revers@@ ed by selecting re@@ activ@@ ating or re@@ produced by selecting editing from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make sure the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to restore and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ pf@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can press your context menu in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are made between also revers@@ ed and re@@ produced .
once you have launched the image processing , you can use the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image under or the entries in the menu file . if you have modifications to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to back up .
you can enter the photo in and out in the tool@@ bar you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse , or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the starter menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fying factor automatically .
view Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the tool bar in the normal view . if you don &apos;t want to see this in the installation dialog by &amp; digi@@ plug ; change the main window . see the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print it in the menu file image and get the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; printing dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole phr@@ ases . you can only select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exp@@ orting printer assistance . if you follow the wiz@@ ard you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which is important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side bar is available without the navigation devices , even in image processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple click on the same rider lets the side bar appear or disappear again in the edge .
in the labelling view , you can insert labels with unlimited size or insert . note that the text is encoded with UTF @-@ 8 . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you may be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters cut and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should notice these restrictions .
after you commented on , you will use either the button , or change the button simply to the next image , which will then be saved .
in addition to the user @-@ button there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata out of the selected file or the database . but this is always performed if you choose a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the evaluation review shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting order . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the sides of the side@@ bar . in order to evaluate several pictures simultaneously , select this and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field . coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the keyword view is a search box for filtering of the keywords , the sample @-@ tree and a selection box with previously used in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; session used .
the sample @-@ tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the first search word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief at the input of keyword in a photo series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for fast access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all of them are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the sample @-@ tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection , if you want to choose a selection with a keyword , please read the sample filter .
the side bar sample filter is used to change the selection of the main windows displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar will be used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search inten@@ tions . if additionally , one or more sample filters from the right side are used , only the cut quantity of these two are displayed . all displayed words are available .
you can also draw and disman@@ tle . if you have selected multiple images in the main view , you can simply draw it from the right side bar and put on the selection . subsequently , a dialogue that you will ask whether you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which was selected to the selection of three images . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a and after that , a sample is drawn from the right @-@ sample @-@ tree to the selection and left . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
these search for changes will take place at each start of the program . it can also be turned off under Settings .
if you have a rule with and created it and determine that it should be one or its , you can change this easily with a double @-@ click on the text and the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can choose a extended search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB , and you will not want to store the images in the full resolution .
this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mostly adapted to &amp; digi@@ plug ; s created concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color@@ fully administered workflow . you can reach a t@@ abled deviation from your camera or scanners . with a colour administered workflow , you can print the colors on your monitor and the colors that you print or in the web will publish them from your digital dark chamber .
if the topic comes on color management , everyone wants to express what buttons it needs to express for the results that he wants . unfortunately , color administration is to provide you with sufficient information about colour administration . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so you will get the desired result .
if your photo work@@ flows are fulfilled every six below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about colour administration .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
your only other image issues are via e @-@ mail or the web where the RGB @-@ de facto standard is .
so if the RGB works so well and the life for all so easy , why should one use a different colour space and therefore have to make a thought about color sha@@ ding things ?
a visual example of the lim@@ iting of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ical region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms side and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to push my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the RGB colour space or not , you have to work your monitor , as s@@ RGB you have to work out . if you &apos;re working as the color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , then use a fitting monitor profile or both .

this tool produces five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . use it before you try further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , un@@ equal , automatic ab@@ balance and contrast extend from the menu Kor@@ rig@@ orous Autom@@ atically correction from your colors to make the best . you will be experim@@ enting with these effects to see which works best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the values above the entire picture , so the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test item as bright as possible without changing its color sha@@ dy . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for pictures of dark or full bags .
like this method , this method is adjusted to the illumin@@ ator of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity can be as flat as possible . in this way , almost every helicopter range has produced the same number of pixels . sometimes this is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle with a picture or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in red , green and blue canal . it determines the dark and brigh@@ test tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ ograms area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture by post@@ p@@ one the lowest and highest values on the biggest and highest values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the bald equ@@ ates from &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly restricted to over a colour space with 8 @-@ bit color . so , if you can perform the white image in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways will be better to correction .
this tool is based on a bald @-@ equ@@ il@@ ateral . it is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they launch it on the menu entry of white wines from the image processing .
the presentation window can be adapted to the size . on the left hand , both the original picture and the preview of the tool is adapted . if you want to see the original whit@@ ening device again , it is enough to click on the window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . L@@ umin@@ anz of the pi@@ er under this mark@@ er will be displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right top , a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynam@@ ically changed as soon as you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful there , even in well illuminated pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and Gamma . shadow alignment lets you improve the shadow data of your photos or dim@@ entation down .
to play with the above controls , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image to calculate the color temperature of the white file . this type will also be set to the temperature and green values .
in addition , you can set the bald @-@ off with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed technique increases the colors if more than a colour channel of the Pi@@ xels is over@@ exposed . this will be shown in the preview as pure indicator , and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . any adjustment of the white file you can set to store this in a text file and store later .
the default settings will return all the filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings can be stored as your original . if you save this , your original picture will be changed .
you can adjust the code depth per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding is also required for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG for formats .
this tool opens the same dialogue like the processing of rough images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour ton@@ ic can be performed by the window for the use of paint profiles . a detailed instructions can be used for use of paint profiles .
another important tool is available in the menu of colours pitch . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always need the same error and therefore always need the same correction . in the manual , you find further information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you will find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug ; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter .
in times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was created if one had a partially developed pressure of a short flash . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas protected and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect to them .
intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows the image which is chem@@ ically possible . another increase is finally produced a negative picture that is not to generate in phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar process effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is edited ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name dedicated to daylight optim@@ ising the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus making a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated fatty colors are also a few phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those who are scar@@ ed with many landscapes too much .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light to contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ ural lights . in large images , the filter can leave the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual that you want to fix the colour console and the illumin@@ ate of the photos . all your adjustments can be seen in the preview . once you &apos;re satisfied with the result , you can use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you can get a picture with bad light conditions . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation may be able to increase the satur@@ ation instead . all changes you can do in the preview . if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ strength / contrast / Gamma , the tool is very complicated to improve exposure exposure . even if the dialog appears very complicated in this tool , you need only the field of application only the area of the slide . concrete the three sli@@ ders underneath the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three sli@@ ders can be cli@@ cked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regulator and make sure the picture changes .
on the right side can be viewed the original and the preview of the image . preview will be dynamic , updated on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : using this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram is displayed on the usable or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . in pictures , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is of usable .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of sha@@ dows , medium and bright sounds . moreover , there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ bs used to change the output value as with the input values , for example , a slight picture can be used as a background , while something else is fore@@ seen in the background .
automatically : this button automatically set the image values automatically depending on the aspect of the image .
store up and store : saved with these buttons , stored values are stored in the file system and later re@@ loaded , the Gim@@ p levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input will automatically be adjusted for all sha@@ dows , means and sunny tones , and click the preview of the original image to set the hist@@ ogram of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option of over@@ exposure controls all the colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below , you see an example of the adjustment of the input applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target figure will be shown dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modification channel : this sel@@ box allows the channel to specify the channel from the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols in order to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . mostly the linear mode is the most meaningful . for pictures with large areas of a constant colour , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a short material to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds can be correspon@@ ded with dark ones and the corresponding image pixel is dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos you want to change a red marking . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the curve you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
store up and store : with these buttons you can do exactly that . any curve you can create with this file system can be saved and later re@@ loaded . file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sunny tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option of over@@ exposed pixels controls all the colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you &apos;ll get the combined outcome . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below , you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channel . shadow and sun tones was applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and used on the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color sha@@ des of photos .
the channel @-@ mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour sha@@ des of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer .
with the channel @-@ out box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by adding the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed by comparison of their own rider .
the preview of the target system has a red mark@@ er . if you move this in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram order to show you the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction it will allow you to keep the general brightness . this is especially convenient if you are also able to activate the appropriate color components , since the channel @-@ mixer then comes to the creation of great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour is coming to a visible noise that comes from the color@@ less . if this is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion thereby in which you can reduce the far@@ es first .
the store and loading buttons are used precisely for this purposes . any bl@@ ender @-@ adjustment allows you to save and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option of over@@ exposure controls all the colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo shown in the blue channel . the L@@ umin@@ anz option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ c@@ tual ability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a step step because color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

with the digi@@ plug ; tool texture use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture apply .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color pattern or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry image texture use texture use to use it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and the three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper text effect is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the parameters of relief is set to 200 .
with the digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame for a picture added .
to keep the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is no easy task . it is a psychological barrier to keep a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the scatter@@ ing eye . under the frame , the module can be started out of image processing .
type : with this parameter you put the desired frame type for your picture . through a thin line , riv@@ eting it turns with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , coupled with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal is added to a sn@@ ail effect and decor@@ atively adding a decorative frame with patterns .
width : width of the frame in percent . the range for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the frame decorated with decorative finish is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of images , especially when you cut the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple an form@@ at@@ ted text to any picture in any picture . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type text device , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set with its characteristics as you need . the larger the image , the larger the character set must be . at the end , select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you &apos;ve chosen for your text may be changed until you click on the button &quot; OK &quot; press . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed .
you can use a template using the digi@@ plug ; tool sten@@ cil over one image .
the menu image sten@@ cil use in the image processing can be used to put templates about a picture .
for sten@@ cil there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add to the compression size of the template &apos;s file size . if you want to add your template &apos;s template &apos;s file size ; if you have to send your template &apos;s templates to the digi@@ plug ; mailing list digi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you have to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the templates for the next start .
after the root folder was set for sten@@ cils , a construction view appears to reflect the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of a folder updated the presentation bar of the sten@@ cils .
among the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the pictured image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button Shr@@ inks the below picture . in case you want to reduce the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole image , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image under the template &apos;s template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your image . the image will then be adapted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; represents three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you have advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but creates especially in dark fields , gra@@ iny images .
the shar@@ per mask works on the contrast of the edges in order to make a picture shar@@ per . indeed , it is not a bit more psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric darkness and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
Ref@@ rac@@ us@@ ze is probably the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without a focus as well as most digit@@ alised pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this also causes the digital edges a bit spo@@ iled . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points can be printed on paper . SLR cameras usually need more retro@@ spec@@ ulation than normal cameras for the private user .
at JPEG pictures often a camera has been applied for internal sharp@@ ening . images in the resource format , however , must always be sharp@@ ened during processing .
some scanners use a sharp@@ ening device already during the reading of the picture . if you turn this de@@ activate , you will get control over your picture .
in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening tool pull . you can call using the menu entry .
they should do so carefully , because the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general it is the useful technique for sharp@@ ening of the tool . in general , you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much simpler than it . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry and experiment something with settings . the presentation window on the right side of the dial@@ og@@ es shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can see you here .
the original image and the preview can help you edit the picture . this shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or amount increases the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ k mask to be strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges produce .
the radius represents a lot of pixels on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radio stations . they should therefore shar@@ pen images to their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture a which is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the corpor@@ al value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . it can therefore define a minimal difference in this way with a soft shift between the tones of the sharp@@ ness and therefore avoided beauty errors in faces , heavens and water surface .
this is an example of the un@@ parall@@ eled m@@ asked filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a corpor@@ al value = 0.0 .
the digi@@ plug ; tool refra@@ c@@ ate re@@ focus is a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs filter Algorith@@ m from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create a picture of &amp; quot ; it &apos;s better approach to sharp@@ ening the photo . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tering . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filtering . you can also start better results as unnecessary m@@ asked . you can start the menu by adding colors Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ze in image processing .
in practice , the circular folding is far better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ aster . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ail@@ ure has a very long tail , which is far away from the original qu@@ ell@@ ular pixel . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ aster will even be influenced by far away from remote pi@@ ds . causing any un@@ wanted results .
sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be very un@@ sharp , but should pay attention to Heiligen@@ sch@@ ism .
correlation : an increase in the correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0,1 only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 becomes the image quality very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue the picture further .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts , so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation size . however , if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the store and loading buttons are used exactly to that purposes . any ref@@ us@@ ername parameters which you have set is stored for later , and then can be loaded .
try to perform all forms , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately , but then left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read images and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture .
generally un@@ sharp m@@ asked for better results as sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by a sharp m@@ asked for a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically , there must never be sharp m@@ asked for arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it can never be able to remove the effect of the inev@@ itable filters . the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters can always be seen at least just as good as the un@@ shar@@ k mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filters is often better in processing small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ clear color pattern has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods for sharp@@ ening efficiency in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator is the in@@ shar@@ k of the area of the dun@@ gh@@ ty , in order to create a more natural p@@ up@@ ille .
the tin@@ tin@@ te allows a customized color for the pupils . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool &apos;s image is one of the most developed tools to remove arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different default settings as a starting point to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth glass of gl@@ ancing and details sharp . a value of 0.9 should be found that no sharp@@ ening of sharp@@ ening is needed . please note that the detail preser@@ vation is always sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
correc@@ ting movement alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value sm@@ ooth@@ ed evenly across all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film code or CCD noise will produce a high value of similar patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best eliminated at a value of 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor via all@@ es. p then defines relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , adjust this value to the degree of noise in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter contains greater structures . the higher this value is required , the more the noise is needed , since it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : can be run as often the algorithm . usually , 1 or 2 goes out .
&#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected , there should be also small chosen . be sure that small angles should generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value so much and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel g@@ ossi@@ p and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more of quality you get through the choice of this option is only small . he doubles the running time . we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons save as and store precisely this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file , and later re@@ loaded again .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can see how picture errors with little arti@@ facts are corrected . the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a unique black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug was a very powerful tool to reduce bil@@ isi . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter tail@@ gate .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts to remove stain@@ ing from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ing from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ ty ; effects of c@@ lown images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about sensor types of digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tut@@ orial .
the screen photo above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ c@@ ous noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the lower window details and the under@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel and can be spo@@ iled at the picture above the image and the color in it becomes sm@@ ooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the pixel distance from the filter to the front look at illumin@@ ating changes . if it is increased , noise tips will be rev@@ oked . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be received and noise , or dirt can come back .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value increases the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot be removed or noise tips can occur . put it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process by the details pane .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process by the details pane .
gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ atory tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dar@@ ker areas , which is typically stronger , however , the shadow ranges .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is lifted up , the edges may occur . if he is on his minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur on the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this .
store up and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later re@@ loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your lives . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected using ( 2 ) , which was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . it is thank@@ ful to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen and experiment with the gl@@ are . the presentation window on the right side of the dial@@ og@@ es shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ plug ; photo rest@@ oring is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce phot@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts of your pictures . it is very well @-@ adjusted to dive into digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alised images , thereby receives the content as well as the human eye makes it possible .
the same algorith@@ ms can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the algorith@@ ms is developed with a different tool , the image error correction , developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ con@@ vey and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it creates some comp@@ res@@ sions &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are shown in the un@@ compressed picture . this attitude shall correct this problem .
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . any setting of photo rest@@ oring can be saved in a text file , and later re@@ loaded again .
photo rest@@ oring is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can reduce like a photo with equ@@ aling noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded using a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film code on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correct under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures was able to see an old color photo taken with an scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts about the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ light and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel is allowed to remove Hot@@ pixel photos with a CCD camera , eight were used . it uses algorith@@ ms from JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression is equipped via a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; there is no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel through CCD defects .
first described as in the previous section , you should download the right dark image to the correct image . a automatic processing of dark pixels will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark image and will automatically re@@ load this in the next session .
the image area and the preview can help you correct within the picture . the presentation window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are emphas@@ ized in all areas .
select an area around the defective pixels at the preview and the results of the Fil@@ ters . select the best filter method for inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : it is obtained an average of the neighbouring pixel . it is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional interaction , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ act the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block can be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , then it is used to inter@@ act the defective pixels in the block .
below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original picture was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug was ; Vig@@ net@@ ting @-@ correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ lined corners , to correct a picture .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo @-@ format , can often not reach the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sha@@ kes ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light to reduce the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ Ob@@ jective shows that behavior .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be used , even with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ened effects are created through motion .
it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of an in@@ filtr@@ ation depth of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ ter@@ filter , which is used without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting @-@ correction turns the transformation using a C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light star@@ ing at the point of the biggest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , or random a light intensity of 2 , re@@ mot@@ .@@ Incre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ strength , Con@@ tr@@ ast and Gamma settings : editing a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the light@@ ness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the objective with these options . the controllers provide you only positive values , as you need to increase the settings .
if you want to adjust the refin@@ ing of the goal of the goal , allow the values for light / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture applied . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . it was also performed in the image with this tool .
the digi@@ plug ; lens dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion . coloured dist@@ ortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree handles the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fla@@ p on the edges . this correction will not be applied in the tool .
the coefficient of gravity corrected the distant corners to which the second gra@@ des . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion may be virtually eliminated .
General : this value controls the strength of dist@@ ortion of the second degree . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion can be corrected and positive values k@@ is@@ sen@@ ical dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the dist@@ ortion . this value seems to be stronger than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the reverse number of parameter general .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads to a correction first count by . negative values increase while positive the image size .
brigh@@ tening : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview of dist@@ ortion correc@@ tions . the values you use for your image , are stored and used next start as default values .
the metric tons or k@@ is@@ sen@@ ical correction should be carried out before all supply or size changes . best , you perform this correction as all first . if you have a picture new and then a ton @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of apparent the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction to help you find this tool a vertical and horizontal supporting line . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can correct the t@@ onne / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic dist@@ ortion with the help of lines .
if you have to correct a k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic dist@@ ortion , the resulting picture black corners . you can remove these with the random tool in the menu , remove them from the image processing or across the zoom control of this dialogue .
for most images the ton @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so correct to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . keep the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of G@@ enn@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for a preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters to sim@@ ulate film code and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator is changing the amount of film @-@ gra@@ zing and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color channels to the re@@ produce of infrared film mi@@ xes , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ ec@@ torate applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the se@@ wers .
the digi@@ plug ; filter film@@ makers is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film@@ making on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers of large silver co@@ ats of the photo@@ emul@@ sion .
the film@@ making effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get rid of a tim@@ eless atmosphere , get rid of everyday life . if you want to see this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ ined view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the bas@@ kets . the default value is , although common values need to be required at ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film@@ making effect on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ plug came ; filter oil paintings generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug came ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil paintings . natural images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the top is choosing the brush size between one and five . thick brushes are better suited for large images . fl@@ atten@@ ing the plain or , seen from the other side , the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and this is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Gl@@ deposit 17 .
the digi@@ plug ; filter coal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dient to create a coal powder . therefore , pictures of their gra@@ dient are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what the scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two kno@@ bs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper control cho@@ oses the pin size and the bottom adjustment the contrast ( plain ) .
this is an example of the charcoal filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result may be further improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug ; filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to return to your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well in pictures with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important at content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ling landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of the filtr@@ ation . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using dist@@ ortion effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft 1 : divide the picture in cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blowing .
shaft 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 , the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time for calcul@@ ating and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using imp@@ urities effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Im@@ shar@@ fe : wi@@ ped the image along st@@ ern@@ al lines which go out of a center . this sim@@ ulates the shar@@ per camera and generates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ shar@@ k : wi@@ ped the picture by turning the pixel into a center . this sim@@ ulates the shar@@ per of a rotating camera .
distances : wi@@ pe the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused cam@@ al@@ in@@ se . the object seems to come back in the background .
movement un@@ sharp@@ ened : wi@@ ped the picture by horizontal movements of the pixel . this sim@@ ulates the shar@@ per of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photo , camera .
soft drawing un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates pictures featuring a dre@@ aming and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos , or add a warm and subtle light .
Sag@@ tel@@ egra@@ ph : wi@@ pe the image through random shift of the pixel and sim@@ ulates the shar@@ per of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color basins in the picture and wi@@ ped it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice small tool to make rain@@ drops on your photo . this makes it natural your pictures a real appearance . it uses a pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ gently protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows to change the size of the dri@@ ps . since the dri@@ pping size is not automatically growing with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the drop of the drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing a section free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use this option to choose the range , e.g. a face that will be free to stay free . if you start the filter , the range will remain free from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops fil@@ er . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ r@@ oring or turning into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu , turning turning or transform@@ ers .
photo v@@ ases is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase up a photo in a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you get a picture b@@ lown out and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm uses here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select transform@@ ers change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the tool to size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorithm photo v@@ ases was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to change the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the Reiter New Size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when enabled , if this setting is enabled , the new size ratio is maintained the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter contains greater structures . the higher this value is required , the more the noise is needed , since it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and loading are used exactly . any input for photo can enlarge as text file , and later re@@ loaded again .
photo v@@ ases is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can break the calculation anytime with the button .
you can see below a sample for photo v@@ ases by adding a small color image to the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of the linear standard enlar@@ ging for comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . image editing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , through supp@@ ress the mouse button and tigh@@ tening the rectangle . you &apos;ll see this rectangle when you move the mouse .
when you get rid of the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut out . this way you can change a good overview of your photo . you can create a new rectangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle will create by clicking on the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button The Zu@@ id button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file saving or file save down in the file to store the new photo @-@ cut photo .
in the reserve area , you can change the size of the rectangle by removing the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio which you defined in dialogue will be preserved .
in the tool after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , it is always assigned the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format of width .
the tool after aspect ratio is used a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal to whether you can use centi@@ meters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically .
below , you can set the range with the Max . relationship button to cut the range on the maximum possible , depending on selected relationship and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio can be cut off its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are displayed the setting tool depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data can be mir@@ ro@@ red and not the original picture .
the settings of coll@@ ision aid enable help to establish , so that you can make your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious parts are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to divide the rectangle in similar harmon@@ ious triangles .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division that is on various natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus mus@@ sel or the leaves of a sunflower . it emerg@@ es in all sorts of things we find as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the old Egyptians and the Greeks who built up your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you create your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i row 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the following divi@@ der is equal to 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition this rule will follow as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center provides liquid relief lines if you create a picture . these hel@@ pers are listed below :
the Golden spiral will get good results for your photos . compared to third party the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles can be used to produce the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be just as being able to lead the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angle also sli@@ pped from the top @-@ mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to penet@@ rate these lines can be a static object of dynamic .
if you use gold triangles in order to break up your frame , you create a effect of professional photographs dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the sec@@ lu@@ sion and other visual information into the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t at@@ tain differently .
the options horizontal mirror and ver@@ ticals can be used to mirror harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a painting with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current picture .
the free press is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo , it happens light that you can &apos;t get the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where the things came around an angle . you can fix it with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . select transform@@ ers free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button settings you can reset the slide again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right above .
to help your help the module free rotation is a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter into picture @-@ looking for the two lines . after reading it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after taking a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function of transformation into the image processing .
a elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atically . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing sm@@ ooth@@ es the image a bit after turning . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tive transform@@ ations will be performed at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . preview will be automatically calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new picture , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new picture , including the empty areas that emerged through the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
according to the view of the perspective the picture will be a bit lowered . for an individual adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after passing the perspective , you have in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is to cut the image with trans@@ forming from the image processing .
the tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and the other part into the opposite side . this is no rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transform@@ ers .
make your picture by using the Horizont@@ al angle and vertical angle . if you press on default , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed on the right .
to your help are a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after completing the installation , the picture becomes a bit confused . for a single shot , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sha@@ vers , and therefore you should avoid this .
after removing the image un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate it is to cut the image with trans@@ forming from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write the formats available from your system and , in some cases , from the type like this libraries , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF on them .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; shows only files to the file size . if the extension is listed in the list , it &apos;s done using the file extension and digi@@ plug ; this list of file extension refers to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can change this list of file extensions that can be accepted . in the section configuration , you can find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you even to select the format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found at Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smoo@@ ther results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the resource format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful anch@@ ors in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or T@@ IFF on the basis of configuration . in the section configuration , you will find further information on the usage of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ;
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the shop of raw photos only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; digi@@ plug ; all support cameras can see below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats which came from &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . this clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . but is not a film processing program and therefore don &apos;t have any built @-@ in options to display films or to edit . if you click on a film file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playback of movies use to launch the program to play .

if you can exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good if the initial contrast was very good , then you can handle the first four adjustments with the module White .
many tools that you need the photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ plug ; their description is followed here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft signs , rough@@ ing , refra@@ c@@ ate , un@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dial@@ og@@ ical type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below , see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . links from him allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ative mode of the area . these modes are :
vertical divide without dup@@ licate . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected door area .
horizontal divide without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected door area .
vertical . the left area displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and lower than the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the front area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can be able to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used in the general installation page can be adapted .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose from the preview . you can cut this frame with the mouse within the image and on the part of the image you want to see a preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all adjustment from the last use of the module are indicated .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely declared itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters in shooting photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider introduces an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull out a square . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this requires your pictures of Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . application can be used to edit colour pall@@ ets and select colors of colors .
the pall@@ ets files installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; can be installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined color and Zul@@ u used colors .
in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or brow@@ se the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palm view as line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color apart . the color is described under the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used too . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a colour to move the cur@@ sor . afterwards , move the mouse in pressing mouse button .
if the check box is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted into the cur@@ sor on the cur@@ sor . depending on whether the mode is selected or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode is selected , you can set up by selecting the check box below Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was produced as described in the last section , can be used along with the actions copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line character if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a colour in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ;

&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graphical ; -@@ Programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphical ; displays graphics with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph is calculated and recorded in &amp; image viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; Kate ; to open or open the graphics in &amp; stu@@ graph ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than this node )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program that sets the &amp; graphical ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graph@@ s . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in an own lower window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ graphical ; without an argument , the tool@@ bar will open only the symbol file and the ( empty ) List Zul@@ u . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) List open files . Click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files ; -@@ files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Gra@@ ph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse cycle ( high and down without special ta@@ sts , left and right at pressing &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below , you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
when the file has just changed in &amp; graphical ; charged file from another program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphical ; can your decision also notice that later , you can change your decision later , you can set the menu option Settings ... to use it , see also .
if you open a graph outside of a running &amp; image viewer ; only open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or in command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; c@@ apped graph in a lower window of the already current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but it can also be subsequently done with the setup dialog .
during program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last meeting again . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also define how the Gra@@ ph should be divided into several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph are to be fitted on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph .
side preview with one on several sites distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site again store shows the ability to determine the behavior when a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
the page opens the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; specify when a Gra@@ ph is open out of a current session . you can open a default behavior in a new window or in a window of the already running session , or determine that each time is asked .
the site conference management gives the possibility to determine the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; specify a default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine , at each start to be asked .
the context menu , usually with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens further possibilities :
here you can choose from different &amp; graphical ; -@@ layout algorith@@ ms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorith@@ ms , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of gr@@ ated graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or left to right ) and then try to produce few edges and as few edges .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ ms is the standard for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . it is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical @-@ dimensional scal@@ ability .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geograph@@ ic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of the image . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF keyword in the image and loc@@ alization may be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geograph@@ ic loc@@ alization is available for pictures geograph@@ ically in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , which are used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itudinal and latitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geograph@@ ic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can carry a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . in order to run a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to download a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the rest of the same time to the same places as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded , automatic correlation is performed in red . GPS track data will be recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera time must be converted to the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . check here your camera zone .
the setting for the maximum time deviation is a higher deviation for the GPS time and camera time . the deviation among them will be merged . the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have any trace data from a place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ related all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differential in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location between camera and GPS is located , you can set these limits here and then cor@@ relate the button .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same location . since the dialog box you will need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and set up and set si@@ e.@@ Guide this forever through until you have reached a sufficiently accuracy . the map can always be selected manually . the card can be changed from card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities for GPS data onto the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported to HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded UTF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four Reiter in which the settings can be adapted to HTML . you only need to select the albums . these albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right hand , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area , it will be shown quickly and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this rider is largely declared itself . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the image below . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider record defines the settings where and how the gallery must be saved with all your associated images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you choose JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course the file size is also explained . all other settings are also expl@@ ain@@ able .
the hor@@ semen show allows you some of the settings from the album riders for pictures , those are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press ab@@ ort around the process .
when the module generates the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program reports to determine if the error occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . press the link to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and carry out on them basic oper@@ ations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer lets himself use with short command and quick access to its functions .
after start@@ up , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change images without change your quality .
this module allows to store images in JPEG format , without save the usual losses of quality and met@@ ad@@ ata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage it is increasing the file size since no compression of the color information is taking place . for example , you will find the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor is currently no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import@@ ing function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy the data from a picture to another . then select the file extension dialog with which you want to copy the file image , so the picture to which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied to the OK button .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide .
the module MPEG coding can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled on the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally you can select a background color for the slide size . with this module it is possible to create a DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD file for your DVD player . to burn the medi@@ ums , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images that are packed into MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures of selected images are listed under image files in the portfolio . there you may also change sorting images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you are planning to select the file on a TV , you must select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe .
next step , you should specify the time in seconds to display a picture below . the speed of the image process is set among them . a low value generates very sudden , a very smooth glass change .
the background colour can be set up next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set to the name of the MPEG file file . it is possible to keep the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a coffee or drink a coffee in all the rest , if you are back again .
if a hint appears that coding or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages across the right settings .
the printer wiz@@ ard allows to print several pictures on a sheet paper along with standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in the RA@@ W format stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results , like the software from your camera vendors . sometimes you get some d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file that will be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Picture Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button you can look the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are used for the white @-@ balance . the main parameters such as Gamma , Bri@@ ghtness and Red / Blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion result is equal and the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged Image format , T@@ IFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W comp@@ ressing .
if you prefer to edit your pictures often or later you should not use the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
in case you choose JPEG as memory format , met@@ ad@@ ata files are stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break down this process , you can use this process .
the pile @-@ processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . use this mode therefore if you are safe , for example , by testing on a single image that are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if this is produced in an earlier attempt . however , a preview of progress is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of that can be used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the image size from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image size or enlarge . in addition , four types of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the picture will be automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image size .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo print . the user can set the printing resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target pattern , including background size , boundary size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send chosen pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . there is also possible to change the size of the additional pictures before . other images can draw on the list of showing images and place there .
after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed by you . via the button pictures you can add more pictures with a file extension dialog . for the last modified image , a preview on the right side is displayed .
you can also draw images to the picture list and add it to the list of the imag@@ ined pictures .
removing the button images , the selected images are removed from the list of showing images .
after you have selected all images , you can open the New message window of your e @-@ mail clients with the button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . those selected images are already attached as attachment .
do not pay attention to many pictures on once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every time you will change until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you have to install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after choosing comments in a attached file , the comments can be attached to the images into a text file and added the mail .
P@@ NG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as T@@ IFF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under picture file format and are the original files in JPEG format , the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the larger pictures .
when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed , so you can watch the status news on the search of errors , but you can automatically start your e @-@ mail program . with the button , you can send this window ? en .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you want to display your di@@ as@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the option Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions in the presentation use very elegant image outputs using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graph card , otherwise the slide is very slow .
the file names indicate that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can manually start with Es@@ c .
the option pictures acci@@ dentally choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so , it will not be used the sequence of images in the album .
under delay between the images , the time interval between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should ex@@ termin@@ ate the presentation your friends !
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses each transition between the images a different effect .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left screen . move the mouse to this corner for you .
with this tool bar you can stop and restart the presentation and stop the previous picture and stop the slide .
at the left bottom screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current picture and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working area .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the lower frame , as a background for your K@@ DE @-@ working surface .
once you have added your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , now in any group , so in persons , places and in group keywords entries are available .
in the browser window , you will see the categories that you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition there are entries to look at the EX@@ IF @-@ based information , viewing the folder &apos;s structure on your hard drive and of course see the actual pictures . in the following will be described each for itself .
if you press the mouse to record people , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you select another person only the images are displayed , on which both people are shown . by this selection method , you can limit the number of images shown from a few thousand pictures to a few more pictures .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view images to view the images of your computer range .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; con@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a own image image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined themselves . see the picture .
to display pictures beside the name , select the button , which you can use on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view of each category separately . it has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and simultaneously ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you need to define the picture for each individual person . to view this , you need to display the image files window ( in closer ) . now you can select the picture for the corresponding person . in the image window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and then select which part of the image will be displayed or cut off .
if you want to see the entry in the main window , you will display a dialog box that is very similar to the dialog for the fixing of the image properties . this dialogue can be viewed at the picture once more .
if you want to enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description , the labels or descriptions of the pictures are searched after this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , so for example , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can brow@@ se all images according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , according to images , in which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user guide book for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; photography album ; and watch the quick @-@ off , screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry into the menu . then , some example images can be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try out .
if you &apos;d rather like to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; con@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the lower edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of these Lei@@ f you can see here : . as the name suggests , this glue shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each rental show you another unit . you can switch between the units and months , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the LEICA only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be interactive on the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , you will always be displayed the first picture of this date in preview icon ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and the mouse via the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data , pull you in the preview view just pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar the tim@@ eline .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ Album ; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . integrated and the other as module is available ( see ) . in the following part of the user name is available in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated version described above the menu file HTML ... can be accessed .
before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precise .
first , enter the title of over@@ print and a description that should contain the HTML file later . HTML @-@ sample pages , see an example of these settings .
next , choose from whether a &amp; photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created on the review page . nour@@ ishing information about export files you will find in .
last you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . so , you can avoid that information from a party are obvious . for example , that all images are exported from a party . you can therefore not use these settings to hide certain pictures from certain viewer .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages are to look like . most setup possibilities are clearly , why this is not specially received .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . this allows those who have a monitor and monitor a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time you have defined . so he can brow@@ se your pictures with low resolution , which can be displayed on a lower transmission time , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , place the different folders and the URL , where your website is stored .
best choose all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the main folder , in which all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and select the next time . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if this is really all right for viewing . if you select a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL you should set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
in case that the HTML files are not yet stored in the final destination folder , so that the import function , see , right , you must specify the final goal of files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders .
the sub@@ ordin@@ ation options described above have all three of the base folder or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is laid out , whose name is set in the output folder .
if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , you may want to create your pictures with these images . you can , of course , have a HTML page to view images . if you are already very much time to view the images , recording location , etc . , you need to do with &amp; photo@@ album ; do not even make this job again .
with &amp; audio album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties will be imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file is only one link to images . the advantage can have all images together and that file might be so independent . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the images on two times . first you can &apos;t find the pictures that you specified in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog box is described for the export of images that you can order via the menu file ... .
the most important option of this dial@@ og@@ es is whether it is intended to act in internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices available :
if you need to copy the .@@ k@@ im file option , you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automatic near the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; copy photo album ; the images are automatically copied for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is really small , it is usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this anyway , simply select the export file .
the last option is to limit the maximum image size . if you are sending your friends images , you may not want to limit the images in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file might be very large . here you can tell the size that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you want to import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exp@@ ort@@ alized database as described in .
the wiz@@ ard to imports consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you would like to import , afterwards , in which folders will be copied .
it can be that you specify the category people to the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is mentioned in your database . therefore , you will need to be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in the categories of the imported file and which categories are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example will see you on the picture .
it must be simple to search pictures and view : if you see images , you often want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will run the various steps from ( 1 ) to the information on your pictures , via ( 2 ) the searches and look forward to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ Album started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today , there is also your videos . at many places in this manual is talked about images , but frequently this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal locking tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or revisions in the CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; note the folder , in which your pictures are stored and used to automatically start a different folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings . set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; with photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to you .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call the installation options and options for viewing . for each setting , an extensive help is available , which you can call through a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
you can also describe how to create different features for each image , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog , which is used to work already existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a labelling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a Mid@@ gli@@ der as stated .
in view the installation options , which are available to you at the fixed selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window , you can choose a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ plug and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plu@@ gin Interface . nutriti@@ ous information on this page you will find on the Ki@@ pi homepage .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . modules can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help @-@ page that you can call on the module itself .
because the modules of several applications can be used together , it can be tested that the modules can be tested with the demo database , before you can call these on your own pictures - demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible to function some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage , if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; audio album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can &apos;t support their pictures in records . even if &amp; with photo@@ album ; this type of order is not supported , it sim@@ ulates the order for some modules so you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
this sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , i.e. all images that show you the picture look at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; con@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here goes &amp; photo@@ album ; as follows :
when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry into this category is a record for the module .
or it will be the category you have set in the installation dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you &apos;re using the category people , you will do so whether you have selected persons to view and enter the module .
since some modules are compatible with &amp; photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove this from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the module , which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you &apos;ll see a menu and tool bar . at the moment we will not see a lot of information about your pictures . in the section we will show you back to this window , now click on the entry images that shows you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures of certain notes at the same time . if , for example , in the picture of Jes@@ per , and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes , if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can define three lists with a text box by giving people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; con@@ photo@@ album ; because you are always able to use information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on shifting the images within the list : if you are shown for example a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be depicted , so that the names used are moved to the top , which are qu@@ icker and as@@ sign up .
if you prefer to get a alphabetical list of the list , click the icon for sorting under the list .
if you have chosen notes for each image , you might want to edit all the selected pictures and have these pictures with notes . Click in this case simply to the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be comfortable to mark all these pictures and use the menu option multiple entries to once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special icon will be displayed .
in the context menu of the Comment dial@@ ogs it is possible to add a entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also get an entry to a category of existing or sub@@ category . attention , this is predic@@ ts that you can order your categories alp@@ habe@@ tically .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the note dial@@ ogs by removing the LEICA , which make the upper edge of the frame , click and move it . you can also make your own window , using it outside the window section .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , you click on the button options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current construction and appearance of the window .
you can also miss a frame even completely . if you want to display this window later , use the button options ... and then click here window an / out . this process will see you in the picture .
if you select the record pictures in your browser , you &apos;ll get an overview of the pictures of the selected pictures , or any pictures if you do not have a filter . an example can be seen here . you can configure the size of looking images using the middle mouse button , and try it simply .
when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background picture for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . just select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the removing button or choose from the menu Edit . now , you will display the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures anywhere , so that you can hold on your hard disk . in the picture you &apos;ll need to record the pictures anywhere , so that you can &apos;t find the pictures from your hard disk . in the picture you can &apos;t find all required images from the hard disk .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pictures are present , so that the pictures of these pictures can show you . however , you can view the preview of these pictures .
as you can see this function you need to copy files out of the folder and copy them again . if you would like to avoid trouble as you wish to avoid the passing of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures on it .
in the menu images , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to make a little more privacy , please filter out the images that you can watch for others . alternatively , you can also see all images that may see your little sister , taxes and the menu entry everything besides current view .
thus , you have set out what images are hidden in case of the case . if you un@@ lock the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry into the menu . if you want to see images again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered for un@@ lock the images . in order to set up this password , select password change in the menu privacy .
please note that this image protection is not very safe if you can read or delete any pictures on the hard drive and to the other , this type of password protection is able to read or delete this type of password protection ; not very familiar with the view of private images .
the reason why you can describe all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ albums ; of course , you can describe them at some time , of course , that you want to look at some point . for this reason , it has a picture _ and video viewer . these can be seen from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you can enter through the image , like who &apos;s on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure which information displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . then , you can see the context menu , you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will give you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons image high and finish . you can jump to the first and final image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run those as Di@@ asch@@ au . as frequently it can download a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can capture a new picture by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or Min@@ us . the slide is stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability to view &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to change the full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete pitch on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can simply enter into the image and get out into the image . with the Min@@ us button you can get out again . with the Min@@ us button you can get out again into the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the Point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the simultane@@ ity put the zo@@ oms , so each pixels corresponds to a pixel &apos;s screen .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that are in and out @-@ out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the script functions from the context menu you can rotate the picture . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make notes on the current picture with the menu notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and configuration dialog of the image to mark this name . but they may only draw the picture to mark and consider further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start viewing with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you are one after the other .
for the two examples above , you are viewing the possibility to view images with traits as you watch them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letter . in the picture you can see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , you can see them in your browser . so , if you have any pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen ones . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or what you just want to do .
categories and special features can display in the preview site . if you can view categories in DR@@ E Vor@@ schau@@ view , then you can add features to the images by pressing simply the letter for the feature after the image was chosen . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , it allows you to display your photo album ; paint on the picture .
the old is not stored in the image , but in the database . in the way you can reset your common later .
in case you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to put the painting mode of &amp; image album ; just select the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar on the window above .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have to work the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should absolutely read and understood .
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object object of an already selected object , as all objects have already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to add the object and click either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select one menu entry in the menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , this will end the following listing menu , so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click on the application to take these changes . if you have invali@@ d values , a message appears with an error description . then you can click on the input command or dis@@ card the changes with ab@@ ort .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter the user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you have a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the economic view .
press a preview of Your Own View and a small example of the scene will be selected with the chosen texture . if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element , even if you want to ren@@ dering a texture in texture map and not the whole texture map ) , you cross locally .
screen photo shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can draw these control points with a mouse button , and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and turning position as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
every object has a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the visibility level of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the tool@@ bar stage of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object characteristics are left , and the four graphical views are displayed on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window system , or if you need another arrangement , you can also adjust them . you can also save several window frames and simply switch between different directions .
to view a window over or under any other view , drag the connector to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle then indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the right to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red at the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you would like to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the anchor in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views on the cart@@ ograph@@ ers in the top in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the shape on your desktop or click on the small arrow to the left above .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the front bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can brow@@ se them in any way .
the current window view can save you with view window arrangement ... Save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window code under a existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual has been written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ dering The symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or choose the menu view scene .
a R@@ ender mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert a lot of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full images in the highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender , in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be opened :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rounded image . if you only want to ren@@ dering a small area of the picture , select the check box and enter the image section of ren@@ dering in the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the features , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering it . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflective photoelectric sensor . an exhau@@ sti@@ ve description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a painting with only one beam is p@@ itted , various errors can be created . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or line effects in bends and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique of anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this bug . generally , pictures with this feature is better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , links &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is constantly split up and adap@@ tive because each pixel is steadily split by the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray appears a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color value is calculated with super sampling rates , both pixels will be calculated using a particular additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be charged with an additional limit of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 R@@ ays per pixel . if the difference is divided between the specified threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel size , which can be followed individually and further on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be set with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam , called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , P@@ ov@@ ray changes the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use lighting reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card card you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object taken .
open a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; Con@@ sol@@ en@@ ant . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ scene , select the menu entry file import@@ ing ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; not yet the complete command @-@ catch of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if , when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window will show a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling , you want to import this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , mark the source code in the editor and drag it to the object @-@ tree .
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ dering . usually this is PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
when you click on the Help button , click &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . place here the path to your documentation and the version . it supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example al@@ tim@@ est@@ ates ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you get files that are not in the file &apos;s file , you &apos;ll need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is stored in different par@@ ades of the library , the first spotted file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle in the camera view and in the window @-@ type label .
you can set the object @-@ catch of points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wireless model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , scal@@ ations and rotation .
bigger values improve a more accurate wire model and thus a better starting point for the displayed objects , but they require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can adjust the detail level for two directions .
if you cross high details for advanced projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses a extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions in perspective and vertical projections . this feature provides a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you indicate wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is shown in a box sample of two adjustable colors .
when you indicate the ground , a floor is placed below the objects . the floor is shown in a box sample of two adjustable colors .
if you turn can@@ oe , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering the scenes is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise to the parameters in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window of window orders will be explained , as you can create and save window frames .
the combination field standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of prec@@ urs@@ or arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . a new setup you can add to the button , and remove a selected arrangement with the button .
any window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can add you with the button adding and remove selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , you will create a new column at the right side of the existing window , with boxes . you can &apos;t get a map view together with the previous view and floating on the main window , but generates a separate window .
so you have just purchased &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and now you want to begin with more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but easy scene , among beginners : a ball on one level .
but you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain about that you can only use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t have a camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black image .
if you add no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black image .
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ less , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the following pre @-@ installed window arrangement :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
you &apos;ll need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols , as well as their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry , then you have a scene without objects .
the wire model list shows how the camera considers the whole scene , which you create . in particular , you notice the scene from the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , you can find the contents of view object properties , where the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera is able to change the camera , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on the left button and drag it to the desired position .
when you press the button and press the input , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change this settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might set a qu@@ ader ( insert end@@ able body t@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually , it offers a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite level as a ground :
a good advice : select the level in object tree , change the name and press the button . in the object @-@ tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model list now shows the level , although at the moment only as a limited extent . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon .
if you check out the object tree , you &apos;ll notice that you can click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , turning and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in view of the object characteristics .
in this scene you should know the ground for exercise a unit under the horizontal line just so you can get some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to place its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue that you can choose to select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the object description ( name = soil pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button you can see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments show only a m@@ ash black material because you can still need to check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you don &apos;t see a color on qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture right now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , these are not the color name . here are further settings necessary . in the colour list you need to enter two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can also do this also more frequently , but the box colour list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the Ob@@ ject tree , select the colors in view of the object characteristics :
you should already be able to run this step , as you have already understood the basic operation of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ore ; already understood . the ball rot@@ ates just as easy as the floor :
in view of the object characteristics you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input or the button to press it ) , so the ball rot@@ ated over the ground , as you have post@@ pon@@ ed the floor for a unit down@@ wards .
of course , Ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as previously seen , the ball surface appears like a m@@ ash black material . put in the following steps a suitable material .
if you choose the ball , you can point a material now . as already in the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select the main object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . Click on the pig@@ ment , then select In@@ colored and set the values as follows :
but you can reach interesting effects if you take time to set some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the application or press the input .
the settings of gloss effect and reflection is already partially good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should have a good impression of it , which offers you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully . hopefully you have learned as much you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera which ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixels in the scene . the R@@ ender is calculated as this beam can affect the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects are processed in pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source , you can also see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in default file dialog , you can select a file which you have done with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu , and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . is it a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and a storage space .
the scene is re@@ produced in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
you can only select this menu entry , if you don &apos;t have any stored changes in the scene .
this menu entry is repeated . you can only select this menu entry , if you use Edit returns .
save the current window arrangement and opens a dialog box in which you can enter a name for a new type or existing arrangement .
in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; here you can change the appearance , the ke@@ epers , and the default behavior .
open a dialog to change the keyboard player . you can modify the default short command for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; commands or add new commands .
open a dialog to device the tool bar . you can add and remove the tool@@ box with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eils .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to su@@ stain rough surfaces without creating each diff@@ le on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then continue to give them a realistic look .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel @-@ based application , using a picture file as color card .
&amp; ku@@ d show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application features a browser browser in which you can choose pictures to display .
images can be displayed either in a window in the size of the image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ d show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n file ; or the key return .
you can adjust if any picture is displayed in a window , or if all images are to use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the data stream in the right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be emphas@@ ized . you can leave the Command box by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
set up in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ d show ; there are five cards in three , General and processing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the work mode of &amp; ku@@ d show ; in the two others , short command for the display window and command commands for the browser , the key skills can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with background colour , which you can set further down . pres@@ et@@ ting is not a full screen .
if this point is activated , load &amp; copper show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for sli@@ deshow .
this option stores &amp; cre@@ ase show ; at the request of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; copper show ; this folder in brow@@ ser@@ window .
Click on the coloured bars to select a background colour . if in window mode the window is larger than the image is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected colour .
you can set &amp; ku@@ d show ; only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
this option is enlarged for large images the ad window on the full screen . this option is enabled .
determines whether the sli@@ deshow should start with the first picture in the folder or the selected picture .
the period between the change of change in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sun@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until they are ab@@ orted by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change here the key skills for the various business cards of &amp; ku@@ d show ; in the flash@@ cards short command for the display window and command commands for brow@@ sers .
this option allows you to switch between the second @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays big icons for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short presentation .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short presentation .
show th@@ umb@@ nails for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short presentation .
the picture is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
virtually enlar@@ ges the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; copper show ; is also closed , if no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is only sensible when the automatic calendar is enabled .
open the input field for completion . specify the first sign of the file that you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .

the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ cases ; to participate , is the developer mailing list . guide to the developers &apos; mailing list of &amp; show photo ; .
&amp; show@@ cases Photo ; tries so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options to access the behaviour of &amp; show@@ cases . in order to set up on these settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the icons of the left side .
in the field of exposure of exposure , you can select the color when the lower or over@@ exposed comp@@ iler was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ies should display the colors with what you are supposed to display , in contrast . exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ room photo ; possesses a side bar at the right edge which provides you important information and promotions to the selected pictures . the same side bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; it is an application to scan images that do not make more than images and en@@ rich .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not make more than images to scan and pull @-@ off . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the pictures before departure .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project site by setting the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ pro@@ ject@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner can &apos;t be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog box is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break down &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; end .
the further settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not contain these options especially .
to download a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then choose scanning for the final scan . the Pre@@ sch@@ aus@@ can is started through the preview button .
in order to select the picture better , the user can zoom in and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom as well that the complete preview of the window fits .
when the image was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you select a preview of Save a preview window in the settings , then the image is displayed in a front window , as shown below , then the image is stored and shame ? en leads to a demol@@ ition and go back into the main window .
the button settings will be opened before the main window . you can change the main settings here .
users can look at the picture if desired , in front of stores . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be selected .
this attitude allows you to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores . dialog for storing each image opens the dialog before each one @-@ called image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folders , then you must save Save without asking a file name .
this setting defines where the pictures are stored at the option . if the images are stored for each scan , this folder will be used as standard for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a image pre@@ fix for the automatically and save images and is beyond the proposed image for the image in the dialog . the automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix who is uploaded any time when a picture is stored . the # # # # # # # is replaced by the numbers .
users can adjust the image quality . this value also changes the compression value for saving . if select the image quality , the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button above starts the K@@ DE over -@@ Dialog box for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and boxes can be used to end &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to end .

the D@@ COP @-@ interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP function break could look &amp; b ; like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command lines of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command lines options .
you should give an feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use box , so that the user does not run a script .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ id@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in folder scripts / templates , you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can quickly find it as the basis for your own scripts or simply notice the required functions . you will quickly find that the letter of scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which any K@@ DE installation should be enclosed .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . this way can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends messages to all current scripts . this is why scripts should monitor their default settings and react according to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to preview the setup dialog . in order to save the store and loading of the setup data , every script should take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working file on the folder , where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signal that a new piece is att@@ ach@@ able . the script might now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume indicates a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ able cli@@ cks : sub@@ menu , Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list . in order to add a customized menu entry , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script script add@@ res@@ menu ( sub@@ menu menu ) to use d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script in@@ mov@@ e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok on ; ends , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do so , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks Script @-@ Administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension cat@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right correctly .
the main descri@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts website of &amp; am@@ arok on . for your entry to K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the am@@ arok &quot; category &quot; scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; am@@ arok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprising to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok ; you can easily go to the play@@ list instead of using endless menus . perhaps you can also find only one particular title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos;s Collec@@ tors browser and the quick @-@ search will find the piece within seconds .

external browser : can you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ arok can be started ; if a browser is required .
other brow@@ sers use : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list .
if you store the play@@ list , the current play@@ list is automatically holding the end of &amp; am@@ arok . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list at the end .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; am@@ arok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
actual piece of piece of piece changes causes the play@@ list windows to stop / off , in order to keep the usual piece in the visible window frame .
when changing the context to the context browser , automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece will attack .
in the section of appearance , you can adjust &amp; am@@ arok ; s appearance . the section is part in three parts sub@@ section .
in the font section , you can adjust the use of different typ@@ ef@@ aces in &amp; am@@ arok . you can select scripts for the following section : play@@ lists windows , player window and context browser . press to choose ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choose custom @-@ defined color scheme , you own the quota of choice and can design@@ ate a own color scheme . use these activated colour select for front and background colour .

the input on @-@ screen display allows you to display on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed , and you can consider the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . Click out ... to select from the dialog the desired font in the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text in the O@@ SD .
in your own colours , you can use the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . a click on the color faces does not open the dialog to color selection . if known colors are not enabled , the default &amp; K@@ DE ; colors are used .
the input box Display Text introduces the text in the O@@ SD . through the input of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . thus , you can design@@ ate on which screen should appear a multiple @-@ monitor environment to the O@@ SD .
the card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the radio box . some drivers are able to activate more adjust@@ ing options in this cart@@ el card .
the map collection is used for setting all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ arok ; to search for music files . in order to include a folder into the collection , mark the check box in addition to its name . this section also includes check fields , as with the selected folders .
Sub@@ ord@@ ner : well : this causes that &amp; am@@ arok &quot; will well as their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder to music .

&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs ( included in the programs contained programs , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to find such modules or scripts ) . we have written a little instructions about how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs .
some features like the O@@ SD predic@@ ts that your window manager will work with fre@@ ed@@ es@@ plan@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make a bug in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library to days . you can see this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and depend on the cap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly , it is estimated that Tag@@ li@@ b comes from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ cc@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , please try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; am@@ arok ; is something more sophisticated .
make sure everyone of &amp; am@@ arok ; used libraries to be compiled with the same comp@@ iler version , e.g. &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to the processing of met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then dis@@ able you . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if it is a frequently used crash , and you will send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 in Meta @-@ Infos , but these are not as Unicode characters . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

if you receive this bug : cat@@ oc@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : cat@@ oc@@ app : uns@@ creen symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ um , then check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen using ld@@ d &apos;@@ d amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to solve this bug , you may have to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .conf to adjust the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation issues clari@@ fy the ligh@@ test through the help of an expert in your uni@@ x or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or in the developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net within the channel # am@@ arok .

after the start of &amp; am@@ arok on ; appears only an empty play@@ list . how come there music pieces there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window was converted into the statistic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the review list has to be displayed in the play@@ list of the play@@ list and select column review . Click here in the new evaluation column to determine the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands for Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files that you want to remove , and then press it on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then remove from play@@ list .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would do with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the Add @-@ button , you can save the play@@ list . Click here .
probably missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el program and install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package . see also once after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations .

if you use the G@@ yp@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you looking for the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may have to specify another sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; am@@ arok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS is also de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend right on AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize your Arts &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :

either do not use the Arts drivers but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts drivers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less applications react the visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ arok &quot; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . manage G@@ ST regi@@ sters to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - download and install it . then run G@@ ST regi@@ sters , once more as a system administrator and once more than your normal user . delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config command . then run G@@ ST register again . start &amp; start &amp; am@@ arok .

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the internet , such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis library : OGG Vor@@ bis is an absolutely open , patented free and professional technology for audio coding and for handling audio data . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layers I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . lame will be used by the MP3 encoder module .
F@@ LA@@ C : an free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less Audio compression and compression compression . it is used by the F@@ LA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write F@@ LA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , F@@ LA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . using FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burning them to a audio CD .
SO@@ X : a program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ X is used by SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a fully @-@ equipped car system for processing , assem@@ bling and analysis of video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for creation of mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces are different no@@ isy .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to launch by CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re @-@ opened projects recently . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . Click on one entry opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project has been stored once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save under is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you would call for any single project file .
closes the current project . if a project is changing and not stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to happen . you can then dis@@ connect between Save and Am@@ end@@ ment . furthermore , you can break down and keep the project so opened .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will be consul@@ ted for any stored project , which should be done as if you were called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each stored project will be asked what to happen , as if you had called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select via the released dialogue files to add to the project . if the current project is directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so @-@ added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the media , only if the project contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many projects @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them is this ? -@@ help are described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you are not used files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you do not use files for multi @-@ session CD . it is more useful for you to see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD @-@ project . this feature caused by sending files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only finishes the previously imported files .
open the CD copy dialog . this also allows the copy of a CD to a different medium . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD , which you should then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copy . you should also copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD copy on a different medium . alternatively , you can also install a DVD with the help of copying dialog . also , there is also the possibility of creating a DVD with the help of copying dial@@ ogs , therefore , the target medium will be large enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data from the source media in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW drive . thus , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
open the dialog to the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write your choice between the write mod@@ i over@@ write and in@@ cre@@ ment@@ ell .
burns a previously specified CD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning buttons . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously specified DVD copy image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously specified DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the site view , but can also be used here . it contains information about the read video , coding settings and even options for changing size and cut black edges .
shows information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if one entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small body is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switches the folder view a or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the site view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and un@@ lock the balance or dis@@ card of the media .
when the view is on or off . the site view makes it possible to choose and pulling files into the project view . the site view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs unless you select a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the head bar in the project view one or out . the head bar is a narrow@@ er area that contains just visible when the projec@@ tile is open . the head bar has no real function , it can only look pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window for changing the key arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the key order to further below .
this starts k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , you can use correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , therefore you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program settings will be carried out . almost all the functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alise and refin@@ ing the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope , so it &apos;s more your taste and the way of your task is crucial for giving you the included programs .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the command program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following in the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have common &amp; K@@ DE ; program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mostly two other parts described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference is it possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the top listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
the cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) of cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string trust ) of add@@ ur@@ red ( Q@@ string path ) of ren@@ dering It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) , offset volume ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :

&amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is a audio CD ; -@@ Elite for &amp; K@@ DE ; with it all you can read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on encoder the installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and supported by many co@@ ders ( compression @-@ free compression ) . more co@@ ach@@ ers can still be added to the program ( if installed on the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other coding are already present , so it is very likely not necessary to comp@@ ile something yourself . however , only the co@@ ders are not used to comp@@ ile it . if F@@ LA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ r / file format is to be used ? a small introduction over Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device is not possible to avoid any copying protection . if not possible , &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; even do not use the mechanisms of Cop@@ ier protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CDs ; s !
while setting up only one needs to be done ( the setup dialog but can be called to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained to the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface that you are often stum@@ bled at the beginning .
can convert in many formats , depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the free@@ DB file or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is collected manually .
this is just a short list of commands in the main character . on the page step , for example , further information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB request from the CD data is based on request from the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case first to connect the connection to the internet . )
starts the reading and - if a encoder in the tab setting is configured in the setup page - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that you can choose from a different encoder than the standard . it is to note that previously the encoder in the tab setting is configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that a file extension will be selected , instead of a full &amp; CD ; to read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ tics ) for programming events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) .
open the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different cards ( such as Encoder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . you &apos;ll have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information should be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can use these files .
among the audio formats , which lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences are less important because both co@@ ders are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , lame will be supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high quality sound quality ( with high Bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from any computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG @-@ player devices are present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially in 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list containing parameters to the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This adjustment gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a Tit@@ els . well Gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ os@@ systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this attitude will be ex@@ agger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you have absolutely highest quality without rel@@ ying on the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are entered manually or run through the program automatically from free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can send / needed to create folder and file names as well as the attributes of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or help to the coding explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ( English ) , when MP@@ 3@@ s will be encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download / enter the information , so that all the other information can be downloaded from yourself in the computer . it is to note that here only from text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( ante . ) I &apos;m not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist may be added to the music company . any information can be added either by the artist through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is active in a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems to be used with another ( counter@@ feit ) address . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used for retri@@ eving data from server ( this can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
there are in many different countries copies of the main database . if &amp; audio @-@ Creator is set up in many different countries , the geographical server will need to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and like the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ ro@@ servers for the online transfer of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually selected monthly ) only the updates to the database .
which software program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see also that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed out of the appropriate distribution first , if this is not yet done .
to save the selected WAV files , the coding and the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free comp@@ ressing for audio data ) can be added to the Code of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the responsible Linux distribution before the code can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined coding . further information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , further information can be obtained via its switch through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device designation on your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give a hint on what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; please control the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to go ahead .
have you read the full manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time and read all our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use lame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled package for the example with a search engine . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files that you can always do .
please make sure that the / us@@ r / share / cd consists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; something which is thought to be done only once .
the second section describes the pre @-@ reading of a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for each extension &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we determine the use of the compression of music ( lame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to use the free@@ DB program to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read one &amp; CD at any time , if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device number is handed over to the read program that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map general settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be stored / entered as shown in screen photo .
in case of complete information please choose , so that you will be informed if data are missing from the keyword ( tags ) .
the boxes CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded on the Internet of a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the internet so he can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD record ; this entry begins immediately when you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory / file names or day entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and file name is changed with counter @-@ order &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter all manually , then dis@@ able the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this is about 620 MB big , if you need to use the database before . for free@@ DB mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following cart@@ el card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . this is settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section on free@@ DB . read everything as shown in the screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and watch them after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way the burden is distributed between the machines . however , this attitude will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , because many fire@@ walls include the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , there is perhaps more fortunate with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit data on the free@@ DB server . the first check box should be de@@ activated .
simply take the settings from the screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author knows not so easy to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross the &amp; CD at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined ste@@ wards for temporary files : if you cross it , then / must be stored in the file / folders . this can &apos;t be useful if only place on another drive is created . do not forget the file in a private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
all as you enter on screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , it needs to be pu@@ ffed after right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned before , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is on average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the record &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos;@@ ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be extingu@@ ished . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be encoded simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive runs out . we will build a connection to the Internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will want to pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each extension &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , the screen photos are a bit different than those for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; you will learn the data manually , instead of taking them out of the Internet . comments are shown on the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD is now to be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , as in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CDs could be identified and can be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding fundamental settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD is successfully completed by the free@@ DB , all the tracks are already completed and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in case that it &apos;s more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also solve this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title &apos;s title
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update &apos; , the rest of the data in the Command box &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the Command box &apos; Update &apos; title , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual Comments ini@@ p@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful termination of the data from the free@@ DB file is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you do not only begin with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words begin with major letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ ired remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set up unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum . this option is set up at the Code &apos; tab &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : no tags are supported by all co@@ dic@@ s or file formats . look at the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to obtain more information .
simply select one entry , obviously with the style of the selected CD ; this is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ editor will be back and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the requested data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply type the entries for the fields of the current denom@@ inations . give the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
Click on the next line in the main window and procedure you have entered the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the denom@@ inations .
note that there is a check sign before each line of a unit . only the titles are selected or out . make sure all the pieces are selected or select the button all pieces on the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection of read out of the read process , this window appears to confirmation . OK , click OK , and then we &apos;ll see a look at the window with the contracts , and pursue what is going on .
Click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window .
this error message will you see if you are trying to work with a code that you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that were not successful are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have writing to the folder for temporary files and the target file ? ; - )
now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of the start of the game .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . this can be read and en@@ code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program does not have the configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and code ( however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message appears in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the coding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; if you are talking to CVS , you can download a anonymous copy here . if you are using CVS , you can already download one of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE . if you read it , you probably have done it already done ...
this section is directed to individuals who comp@@ ile by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs if it &apos;s time , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . best you can read the settings for the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different cart@@ on maps of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu is cli@@ cked on the first time of the program , without any point of view as it is going to continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if the time of the program is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu out ?
why is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t stop this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; however , if you want to add something N@@ üt@@ z or change it . at least just after contact with the author . and if you read this , it is therefore understood this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ ous@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others he does not have any real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real high@@ lighting of texts , some properties that have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asonic project drivers , which is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing colour , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of each MIDI channel through high@@ lighting of the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can draw in &amp; K@@ DE ; every MIDI file from one &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window on boxes .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( event events or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure respectively .
seat support . if you &amp; K@@ DE ; during the playing time of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song .
you can also get a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; c@@ mid ; window fall . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and push the button you play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry play from the menu piece or enter the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start when you pull it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is played , you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b .
when you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space break or the select of the menu entry in the menu piece , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts the playback . bet@@ ting the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up which events are supposed to be displayed , and even better : the event type will automatically be selected , so you will automatically adjust the kar@@ aoke text . but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set an event type , select from the menu settings the entries , or song@@ writers . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are the series to be played . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , you first open the collecting manager . find in the menu collection under the point . ... click New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking the copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the th@@ under in the collecting manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when applying this collection , this collection will not be saved . if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the Collec@@ tive Manager . there you can add a song with the button to add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setting automation back to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opening pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to select the collecting manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the sub@@ menu of the menu collection , the songs are played in sequence , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove songs or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collecting manager , or use the select list on the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button on the right .
in order to jump back a song , select the button preceding piece , the previous piece from the menu piece or press the button arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collecting manager , select the delete collection and click the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter since it is stored in leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map General MIDI events in oc@@ curren@@ ces that understands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , conver@@ ts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you must edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all the required changes for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . requirement for this is , however , that each occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... End Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map &quot; ... End Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and End that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches from General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use will look as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored . it is believed that the GM patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
for example , the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put on the sound with number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( e.g. with sound 60 ) you can handle a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a thread . this includes the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
therefore , if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( v@@ ault ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the concept drum patch of the patch is meant with each tone a different per@@ fusion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the clay means the pitch of the same drum ( as many keyboards have it ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify as sounds on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as at P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to map tones on the Per@@ k@@ ye channel . look at the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to transfer some channels to other channels . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , make it simply in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is used on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , you will continue to use the Key@@ map with the name name for this channel . if you want to change the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to always use the per@@ forman@@ t patch on the per@@ k@@ ine channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio , in which proportion of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied by the value of n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value is 4096 , so that the Map file is not dec@@ imal ( Dec@@ imal ) .
this setting is used because GM exists that a keyboard that will play a pitch of sound with the value 4096 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some sounds to get two sounds up to a oc@@ tave above . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; c@@ mid ; try around .
to use an MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ ps ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these pieces you see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the can@@ yon view to change the instrument on a certain channel . if you have modified an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view in the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
the Tempo LCD displays the speed , played with a song . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . so , for example , you can find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played , it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so it can result in the same MIDI file to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same score in very different ways .
well , I can force to force &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
that can happen if you have a binary ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
agree , it supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
in advance , dis@@ able the setting automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; K@@ DE ; - Desktop a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I don &apos;t want to play a MIDI file or I want to play a file , merely go to the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window , and draw the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; pull .
if you want to listen to a file , without having to add them straight to a collection , turn off the setting automation back to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open from files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. not only want to play the first file . so you can adjust the setting automation for collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains the MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I anim@@ ates that , continue to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ ers@@ ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my Hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I collect program , MIDI files , make music and prove phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , error , or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; do you or even if you simply want to make me happy , write to me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you must comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL , it runs as if you would have a sound card except that you cannot listen to music .
if difficulties pers@@ ist , contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new releases , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu . select individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category long play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ archy . if you prefer an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups to the current category will be copied and playback starts with the printed entry .
the categories &apos; Current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / k@@ m@@ player / , can also be changed through an editor , but also through the application itself . through the click of a sub@@ group , only the XML content will display this part .
after changing XML files , you must choose from the menu with play@@ list and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost if editing mode or another group will be selected without the play@@ list .
following the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched through the change of XML configuration files ..
the animation will be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change from &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
the animation on st@@ ables doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will be terminated automatically by opening a different source . this would be distur@@ bing at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f . / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ works ; In the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the disk space from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; m@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played by the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
with that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can use HTML pages to use the &amp; m@@ player ; module as service providers for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; m@@ player ; is available in a consol@@ es application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this is determined ) , it must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should use all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be configured to use the configuration dialog , or the TV channels can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected ports ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR support can be used by k@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video ( probably this type of playing video equipment under Linux is the only works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux server must be working on the X server . therefore , this is why the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional volume application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably will be accessed on the package &amp; tex@@ tual ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the use &amp; Linux ; distribution can be included . for installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation CD / DVD will be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without additional comp@@ iling and are contained on the k@@ ile ; web site .
this manual is for everyone - independent of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation can be taken into account . however , the support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; web site .
if you have any questions or to comp@@ ile in comp@@ ile ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; c@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; - Desktop . &amp; c@@ ile ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ ile , edit and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ ile , edit and authenti@@ cation within the source texts and conversion tools for these . conclu@@ ding , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to experience the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found directly with reading the chapter of &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TEC@@ H . it can also use a La@@ ie ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; it can also be difficult to use a La@@ ie ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; a less sophisticated but more realistic refresh@@ er is that it is the re@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
in this case , only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book for this . to try &amp; lat@@ ex ; correct pet@@ ers such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W.

just as other recording languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized features such as paper format , side view and text message can be set at at least the command \ \ &apos; class , the Cologne starts with the command \ \ release { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a unique feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) offers some people for the creation of the document . there are also some of the document related settings .
document classes : this will be the type of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scan &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this will be used to apply the character encoding . modern systems will increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used additives for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they can only be drained on the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find the German text for creating German texts .
new users are now no wor@@ ries to worry about . it &apos;s just a brief description of functions and more detailed information in this section .
&amp; c@@ ile ; it offers - just like other sources of source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is often noticed by a modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and preser@@ vation .
with the automatic adjustment of environments such as \ \ release { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically create a space ( for entry of the text ) and the matching line to close the command ( e. g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be activated in menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; the description of the document into the following items ( part is the most common and sub@@ ordin@@ ate element ) :
in view of the document in structural view , the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective and viewed .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful , as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; rounded file ) &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; c@@ ile ; through a click of the medium mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file includes a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information such as the font , or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and print of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and tann@@ ins .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ene search , the elements of DVI ; -@@ file has been cli@@ cked on an element in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the exact opposite is the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is spec@@ ulated for the appropriate position in the DVI ; viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used to work with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified using other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no mistakes in the source code ) .
file information : in this mode , the DVI ; file is based on the subject of nature , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast construction .
considering the editing tool bar , the three large @-@ scale selection fields should be developed . the first selection box has been developed for the quick installation of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field Other is for entries of articles such as keywords , notes , notes , or references .
name : with this command , a name is created for a section , a picture or different element .
regarding : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection for a selection box ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is indicated . for the processing of &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are corresponding editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¼ Ã © is used for the creation of the font . it can be written for the main text to be defined as notes of notes , etc .
in the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection options are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document through selection of document and consolidation of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by the reason .
the bra@@ ckets according to the instruction \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font color . if the font is not specified , it can also happen in the text .
as soon as the source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the menu building or the button .
the source code must be stored before the comp@@ ile . &amp; c@@ ile ; for saving the storage automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an environment ( English ) is a text , which is otherwise treated as the remaining document . for example , a report with the font color should be created and only a few seeds shall have a different font color within the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the details are given only within the environment ( from \ \ ) { n } to \ \ end } . there is no protection ( number ) for details within a environment .
there are many people to provide reading and us@@ ability of the document . for example , there are certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , c@@ apping pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either connected with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ &apos; { Premature Ejaculation } : this command is for the spa pressure , and is long as long until he is closed with a \ \ end { stamped } or another environment . a single word in a proposition can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } cur@@ sive .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ &apos; { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex code ; it is now displayed a step @-@ for @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in an assistant , a bit text has been entered , a few adjustments should be completed for better read@@ ability of the document . to this , at least one quote , some places in the fat and c@@ apping pressure and a poem is used to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document has been viewed , editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . an external viewer needs to be closed with an external viewer .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; post@@ script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a framed file format ( English . D e V ice I n@@ ate ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi edition such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screen .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - by clicking on DVI - can then print the document using a file ( if the printer is properly set ) .
the tool bar allows the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is created , the conversion can start in a different formats using the top P@@ FE in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ presentation look at the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . to this end , only modern can set up modern under settings ...
in order to search for the preliminary search , the mouse indicator has to be positioned in a line of the source @-@ texts and connect to pre @-@ search @-@ search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then done then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the medium mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document &amp; c@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor should be specified as text editor ( setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
should the use of fast construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer can not be used , an error occurred . should there be a mistake , this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window .
the log file extension refers to error source in the source code . in the editor , the recording file will always be used in the error . in order to consider the faul@@ t@@ ful line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ged line , navigating immediately to the f@@ law@@ ed line .
as soon as the corresponding button in the tool bar is cli@@ cked , a window is to choose from a selection of the document for the document . the default values are :
when selecting empty document , a document may be used either by reason or the wiz@@ ard to create a new document . further information is included in the section .
user @-@ tier users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate creating a new document .
to create a new presentation , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file extension or a new file must be created . &amp; c@@ ile ; can create a new template using existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a template using a file new , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing codes ) . these variables may be set in settings of K@@ ile ... settings .
when creating its own presentation , it is therefore necessary to know which characters can be replaced by the variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically they will be used : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and that in the editor &apos;s instructions . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been accomplished :
the creation of a new document can then be the own template instead of the standard material .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . a simple way to create a template should be searched after one on the Internet and can be dr@@ illed under the steps below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the ability of reading and high@@ lighting of many different kinds of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; can be made out .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his mom would like to learn the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found directly with reading the chapter of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find a balance of all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use it as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with folded Str@@ g button to balance the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way , click \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when pulling the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker mouse , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated switching key , the source of the source code in the Edit@@ or@@ window will be balanced .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to brow@@ se the wide variety of sources of sources and emphas@@ ized this . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants are identical to spr@@ int stamps . this is a type of book@@ marks within the text . this is also highlighted the jump stamp or the corresponding key brand , so that it will be automatically log@@ ged in the first input of a sign .
the Edit is probably one of the main component in using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent M@@ Ã ¶ g@@ ages have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under processing equipment , the following commands are included in the text @-@ selection :
if you have a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) , this extended meaning does not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only preventive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; this means that the figures are separated by two blank lines .
if the word is under the current cur@@ ry position . this selection also has a enlarged meaning , since this command also has a lat@@ ex ( \ \ ) and a positive star ( * ) at the end .
for steering a part of the document , this first can be removed and by pressing the button . &amp; Kate ; offers the ke@@ ep@@ le C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides with its commands for faster data . under processing , the following commands are included :
removes a complete paragraph . definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description on processing equipment .
it has already been clear that environments can play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under processing surroundings for a simple , simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to the surrounding area .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
when the cur@@ sor is found or within the command \ \ in the { surroundings } , the end of the environment is spra@@ yed ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many sh@@ ined ambient commands , the environment can be lost quickly . this command does not close the last setting , so that the tel@@ egra@@ ph environment will not be broken .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under the Te@@ X @-@ Group there are some important commands that comply with the surrounding area .
with this command , at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the sli@@ pping cl@@ amp .
with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closing cl@@ amp .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the weak@@ ening cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is , is spra@@ yed at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many screw@@ ed groups bra@@ ckets can be lost fast to the most important groups . this command does not close the last group , so that the sh@@ ook structure of the &amp; tex will not be broken .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple beg@@ inner signs are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple trials is used . also for the end of the beginnings , the sign is used . &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and for two closing arguments for r &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic adjustment of the double vac@@ ations can be set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X .
it also applies to specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ée or French ) , so that German or French beginnings are used . there are also many other languages .
in the shift of shift ; input for &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is within a lists of environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a line breaks , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close within a tables area close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line breaks .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ take default &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to under@@ line . these can be added to settings ; setting up the La@@ Te@@ X .
some users can arrange the columns in tables and all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) . &amp; c@@ ile ; tries to inv@@ ent them . if this tab@@ ulator is not the corresponding tab@@ ulator , add &amp; k@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns is added to the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already there is a good source code for us , this in &amp; k@@ ile has been added ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still extended . all these modes are equipped for the automatic adjustment . all of these modes are used for the automatic adjustment of settings . all these modes are set to be set .
in the beginning a new environment through the command \ \ release { surroundings } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when drying the R@@ Ã ¼ r , the last letter of entry is removed and can be confused as a result list . on the other hand , the list may also shr@@ ink by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are subject to selecting a command . alternatively , a simple jump to these positions is open , so that a simple jump to these positions is open , and the corresponding parameters can be found .
inter alia c@@ ile ; c@@ ile ... c@@ ile ; adher@@ ence settings to these lists can be made . there are different colors lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as alarm from the general language use .
the command mode is not valid for the completion of environments . it can always be entered a few characters with \ \ . in the other hand , environments will be a large list of environmental commands to result in . on the other hand , environments will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of environments .
in the call of the data processing mode , the menu should be automatically revers@@ ed , or the ke@@ epers will be automatically registered and it appears to be \ \ . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued in the easiest way and can be stopped by pressing the entry .
after all this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; we recognize that it is a lists of a lists , even a first \ \ item command can be found .
inter alia c@@ ile ; c@@ ile ... c@@ ile ; adher@@ ence settings to these lists can be done . this mode uses the list of full speed mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ lined custom lists of ab@@ uses , which are immediately replaced by l@@ apping strings ... K@@ ile promises to be created . as an example , the file is called ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L entered and the word is fully equipped , the code is replaced or the C@@ tr@@ l + Alt @-@ space button , the code L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
gro@@ ans are not helpful for the automatic deteri@@ oration . however , it was found that many whales are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile is offering you to all who have been written for everyone .
this mode can be alig@@ ned to the volume of K@@ ile ... K@@ ile promises . here , the corpor@@ al value can be specified . here , the swelling can also be specified .
the installation files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / play@@ / fashion / / pers@@ ist Home @-@ folder . mode is included for the manifest@@ ation ( heating ) or tex .
the graphics features are designed for graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics , the sections should be considered .
PS -@@ files are not as well known as PDF files , but also offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF edition can be used , then the pages will be arranged with a few &amp; post@@ script file , and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
in order to determine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the areas of creating comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewing like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the more conversion can be used to the key values of Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file , and using Alt ; 5 the PS file has been viewed .
when using the command fast construction , a viewer is usually called upon the comp@@ ile . should not be used any embedded viewer , so every time a new window will be used .
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... See the following information for the project :
when downloading the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the output of EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be administ@@ rated in the vertical glue .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be found in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ;
as first , it must be said that the extraction environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well @-@ developed system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different hel@@ pers for under@@ taking users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents , including a documentation for those contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
it is not only about a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather is a fully maintenance manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific form . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / texts live ; the Find of the right document is not always easy . as an excellent help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / texts live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which includes a database with all of &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or stroke . of &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space of space bar the viewer for the document .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a tor@@ mented and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor that can be used on all systems with installed &amp; K@@ DE ; is also a part of the Fink project , making &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; also installed OS @-@ X can be used .
many thanks to those who want to continue with the development of the &amp; k@@ ile ; project and for many hours for the development of tools offer that we can use all under the contemp@@ t of the &amp; GNU / License .

the plug @-@ in , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; do not have little to do with them . this allows you to benefit from the additional functionality to immediately and need not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be used . more about it below .
to install an Plu@@ gin or a K@@ Part , we start with the plug@@ ins menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialogue enables to manage all the plug @-@ ins to manage and add new items . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ item in it :
here you can enter the search path . adding plug@@ ins without a storage place &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path leads to the plug @-@ in .
there are often several people working in a project hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Tab dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of user and serves for a unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader and Sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who he is . this happens by looking for the Team member of the list and the button S@@ etze as expresses . that is currently selected member ( their identification ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ name and attitude of identity are important for news and notes . see further information on remarks .
besides the overview of their team there is another advantage of the members of the team : it can be created an event to the team leader when something happens . see in further information .
event promotions are actions that are executed when something special happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , as much someone should be saved , or the sending of a message when a file is backed up when added to the project , as soon as they will be added to the project , etc .
on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog Dial@@ og@@ es can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address list selected address . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see in that such conduc@@ tors are set up .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note : it may be selected either the note message from the editor @-@ context menu or select the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by drawing text .
notes can be sent to a determin@@ ant member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nick@@ name of the introduced top name of the team member leaders , should be specified in the project manager and Sub@@ project leaders , such as in the following examples below .
nick@@ name and roll@@ ers names are independent of big or small , but space for bra@@ ckets and notes : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting , DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nostic is and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set to be called Qu@@ anta ... to be called . Th@@ er@@ Dialog extends over some pages that will be treated after each other .
the behavior of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car damage , may be modified . the entries are :
large / Small Description of Tags : large / Small sch@@ ema from automatically added tags . normal big / small notation means tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
large / small pe@@ eling of attributes : large / small pe@@ eling of automatically added attributes . normal big / small notation means the attributes will be as inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if specified , is optional , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags automatically : how to make all the others tags with the exception of simple tags .
update and final day automatically update : when enabled , the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of accent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters into the corresponding coding during ti@@ pping .
M@@ IM@@ E types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . using default , the default values can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other ways than with open @-@ open files ( where the coding of the file can be approached ) . however , this setting is transmitted by the same in the Project Properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized . however , this setting is transmitted by the same in the Project Properties , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; generated regular securing effect , allowing you to restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for the stored documents , a backup is regularly created , according to the set time , created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or one &apos;s view ( or documentation in a cart@@ ography ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings back to the standard at the next start is useful if the user interface has come through the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ess command line parameters .
warning messages is the option of the possibility to dis@@ able the ad of war@@ nings by theft of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can also change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source list in shared mode . regarding the different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be dis@@ closed in detail .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure of the structure with the mouse buttons .
in the structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in text , while empty groups are such , in which no element is found in the current document .
the area for determin@@ ing short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) that will be un@@ folded in groups , each may be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s valid , it may be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ config file means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plug@@ ins are able to be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications of the third side , which can be used by any K@@ Part application , on the best @-@ known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be the following :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not on the standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is handed over to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of current file ) or the project file .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in ref@@ uses to store the store . only check @-@ in parts usually refuse to store when this option is not selected .
check the Plu@@ gin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the adjusted information is correct . dis@@ able the saving of the application is then not available if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the error search was completely re@@ developed . no support for the d@@ b@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of it a de@@ bug@@ ger Plu@@ gin has been implemented , which enables various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bug@@ gers for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bug@@ ger plug@@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bug@@ ger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the contents of guarded variables . usually , in the left Do@@ ck .
one view , where all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed , usually appears in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( like in HTML ) of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bug@@ gers , everything is or part of the following functionality available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger is necessary , if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ s . this action will be triggered by default when a project will not be used , so in the normal case does not have to be respected .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Start the session . closes the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger or ends the leaves to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with using a browser window to view the current document . the output of this requirement is shown in the de@@ bug@@ ger output .
points out the de@@ bug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script and the currently performed line continuously . if this happens when the script is done , the execution will continue . happens , before a debit claim has started , the script will start with the requirement .
points the de@@ bug@@ ger to start with the version of the script , without information to overs@@ aw variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is done , the execution goes on . is the execution as soon as a requirement is made .
de@@ bug@@ ger performs the next statement in the script , without going into the functions or includes :
the de@@ bug@@ ger performs the next statement in the script , although possible in functions and includes in@@ correct adjusted .
points out the de@@ bug@@ ger to pass the directive and go to the next way , as if it did not exist .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs and how to help &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help to become better .
document type E@@ editing packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; enable to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and scripts , as well as &amp; CSS ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or CSS ; &amp; DT@@ EP ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars ( above the editing window ) to include text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever be .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be done manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in details for transformation .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insert of tags to a document without risk of writing .
tag folder are not as folder . they only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day @-@ folders bear the name of the in@@ descri@@ p@@ tion@@ ing language and version , so there is . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible to make other users a better view and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations are placed in simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains as a only element type about himself .
the type of tags is a script feature . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day @-@ type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for Type Method . returns the name of the class , where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this item can only happen once for each attribute . additionally , it sets the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains more tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source codes used for the attributes in the tag Edit@@ or@@ dialog and attribute @-@ tree in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . d@@ co@@ p interface is used within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface . d@@ co@@ p method@@ ological name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , one interface and method@@ ology name . the arguments that will be handed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag which group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only happen for an attribute description . it is an only element type element .
speci@@ fies the attribute of a tags inside a dialog . this day can only happen for each attribute in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ able Tags . this item is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this item is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to begin with a &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . at present , check only occurs during the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following example , for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ key = &quot; character &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D indication ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
a action can define action with settings ... created . Click on New Action to the same dialogue :
this action assigned short@@ cut key . with clicking the user defined user interface , a key abbrevi@@ ation can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current ke@@ epers can be removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the det@@ a@@ ig@@ ated settings and inserted this text in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or as input ( or parts of document ) . even examples from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the quick start @-@ up dialogue or the different see ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are permitted , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ . in this way : global scrip@@ ting folders : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we replace the current document . in case of a local document , file size : / from the document name is removed .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; process . if from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is taken , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters of this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods mentioned above , a script input of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus can be used on the default entry . in the radio box input , what are the default to be sent . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected field of document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually sensible with this setting .
accordingly , the output of the application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , on the default output . it can be stated that the default output is to be specified by the default edition :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in this case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you must add actions and configure . select Settings menu .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes and you are planning to enable you to edit your dialogue &quot; Day &quot; when available , so that input will be possible when using the action .
Ig@@ ou@@ itt ! is that a bad symbol . who should remember the action with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; menu ; , graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; K@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
with regard to that day start , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as an example ) , or should be sign@@ alized , or at least , a message to the user will indicate that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; it starts in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the required action . besides the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder , in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and put it on with other tags , so there is , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for tool bar or it should set this for a better overview through some Tren@@ ders into several groups . make the tool@@ bar set up dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the tool@@ bar is chosen .
I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( top left ) for my tool bar . after choosing the element , which should be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ positions of all symbols , to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right file , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that its tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the notable extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ atting language that you like best . this is why I describes this chapter as I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory whether any one has done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc / language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second , we treat you here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example , ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Sec@@ tions Section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.1 Sec@@ tions 2 = Day 2 , Day 2 = day 2 , tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the document tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation , # Language Reference Table Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic syntax = Basic syntax = basic syntax = Plug @-@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess bar code ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents can be refer@@ enced directly to one file ( and clearly stated at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eien .
the section of the section is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended to display the context of context &amp; PHP ; for example , if the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function will be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file binding .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c / share / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R /
if you are sure that this is good and value is to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , such as documentation were not rich in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise to whom are sent . at different places there is an email with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , tool@@ bar menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts in the script and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download it . to sign a useful contribution , we recommend to sign the resources to sign up for a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this means that the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked after their Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case you can search for a new resource ( URL @-@ preview can remain empty ) , and click OK to upload the up@@ loading .
upload the upload tool@@ bars from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) to upload tool@@ bars , and will begin in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , even before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the case of problems , it may be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work with XML @-@ languages which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time to work by adding a DT@@ EP package because hundreds of day files can be needed in the day XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D load and conver@@ ge of a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
objective name : newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p file .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string that is in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d will be released
fine adjustment of DT@@ EP according to conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; according to converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this opportunity .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these fundamental concepts we have to do with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; quantitative ; little benefits .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; quant@@ aph@@ lus ; it is possible that the group of administ@@ rators are stored in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators different work@@ stations , actions and patterns in a global tree that can be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ pattern up to tool@@ bar with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are filed under the folder &apos;s folder and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the building sites , the cart@@ ograph@@ ers with information and the tool@@ bars . please suggest in , and for further information regarding these areas .
one can click the box with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current documentation , such as close the current , other or all cart@@ ists , re@@ loading , del@@ eting or upload of document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click on the Editors &apos; link to a further context menu related to the processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , processing under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , if the string is described under the mouse poin@@ ter a file .
at the top end of the editor there are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and thus linked users needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to include a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; embar@@ k ; in their document , then click the icon which has to include the date . if you want to insert the data for this just one day , you can insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box of various fields .
the construction prospects ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and pass through . in the presentation with cart@@ ograph@@ ers are available for files , project , pattern of documentation , documentation , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as add , removing , upload or delete files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities to be open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection it is used . the category depends on the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project is also working here . through clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button you can select other functions , such as the script , edit or send an email .
with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . through left @-@ click of an element , the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the element . by the right @-@ click of an element , a list of instructions in terms of navigation and handling of the tree is open .
this tree appears among other areas of construction . with it , some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces may change . the modification of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks is possible .
here is the full documentation for Web technology for your development . it can be downloaded for &amp; quantitative documentation ; from the quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be downloaded , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ ists at the bottom of the window , can be achieved via the usable information : the news window and the problem window .
this cart@@ ography shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . so , for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are indicated .
this cardboard box shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed will give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility of defin@@ ing their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive about &amp; email ; if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can secure this in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and charging !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the site of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus files on your system . in order to get a complete list of options that can be handed to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems at stake of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H is on the same folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during an effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers started to deal with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand@@ alone , expand@@ able mark@@ up languages ? well , this would make him absolutely great for Web development tools for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
not longer to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ize : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quantitative ; for it should be suitable &amp; IDE ;
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; quant@@ aph@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why development , which already has someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; rum@@ or is not only this everything possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity dramatically . through self @-@ painted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , autom@@ ating almost every task is possible . through this program , they can expand &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , without any scrip@@ ting language language tax . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is with help : / quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or hel@@ p@@ center help : / quant@@ a execute ) .
&amp; quant@@ a ; is currently developing and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list is changing every time you can open a file , which is not on it , whereby the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . if you try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project presentation folder , only an error will be reported .
convert to insert from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special signs for the &amp; HTML ; en@@ roll@@ ment , so they are correct and not be understood from the browser as a form@@ atting assignment .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ ens@@ hr@@ ase , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in the URL ; s . first line to add &amp; URL ; s is used in the anchor tag .
switches block selection respectively . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are chosen !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed using GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the news window and not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bug@@ ger .
the problem and en@@ roll@@ ment of the problem rep@@ orters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Haupt@@ f@@ enst@@ ers . the problem reporter is activated once you are changing to the structure tree .
shows the symbol @-@ old left from the main window . this column allows you to set up with a mouse click .
when book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries prior or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ s@@ ors in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu , group@@ ed after the file names of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects will be saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presented a dialog to insert files into the current project . selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches for the project directory after new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project file or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find detailed information .
charges a project tool . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only stored in this menu when you assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
open a dialog to add a new factory tool@@ bar . this creates only the names . actions need to store the tool@@ bar via tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when ordering , if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the viewing area . if you don &apos;t delete the tool@@ bar yet , you will be asked if you want to do it .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu option opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server where everyone can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or someone else has made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / auff@@ eur of the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities should be cra@@ cked out without the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store will fail .
this menu includes a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day installation dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific under@@ men@@ ding .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insert of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert the insert using tool bar , if this day is contra@@ dict the rules this day .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins listed under the menu listed below are listed . Click to click on a activated plug@@ ins .
select the Syn@@ tax@@ ies mode for the current file . the list of available measures are based on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using external application tidy .
immediate change@@ over between different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over time might need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card size , which is also the default mode , or the lower window mode , which corresponds to the presentation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open window window . with selection of a insert the corresponding window is enabled .
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main character .
the changes in this dialogue apply every application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web brow@@ sers .
judge the behaviour of the Edit@@ or@@ derer . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find detailed details .
a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or adding which you can change .
this should be a help according to the setting of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but like with each open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled up at the top of the project , as for example , after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Tab .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file , file will be automatically filled out .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces using the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine that one wants to access , one , apart from local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , default settings are used . depending on the remote computer , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder , in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standard .
this is the folder , in which the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of standard .
this allows files to include files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
this setting is great if you have static we@@ bin@@ der you want to download and change . in ser@@ ver@@ page scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
def@@ ending , if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are supposed to be integrated . if a project is started to restart , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make an exact selection of di@@ lution .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by anch@@ ors or , by removing the bun@@ ch , out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with project Properties in the lower window profiles or with the key Shift Shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which will be rev@@ amped with project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supplem@@ entary option to top , even files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded during opening the project . can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bug@@ ger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin can be set with the button options . in case the error search is described .
in the lower window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the indication of a construction view of the server for each profile , forming a own building view for each profile .
in the lower window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details in details .
in the event configuration , you can switch event promotions and add these actions to change or delete these actions . event actions will be executed when a certain event happens , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is currently not influence .
to open another project , select the project ... from the menu project or the symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you will be asked whether you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you upload a new project .
project management reports are free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
as well , however , the entries are missing and opening up with ... in the right mouse button menu :
here , different profiles can be searched here . the profile contains information about the site of the uploaded files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing .
the password will retain in the core memory and if the program is forgotten . this possibility is useful when the frequency of upload files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password will not save in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialogue if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ load profiles can be uploaded to the project ( or parts of the project ) to various servers . in editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the server name to be copied onto the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves from . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service not to the usual port .
depending on your attack wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it according to your discretion , so it can &apos;t be read on the plate , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone with programming results can be seen easily in the plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simply divers of view , can be loaded several files and tool@@ bars , and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored or delete on the tool@@ bar project , or the project tool@@ bar via the tool@@ bar project tool bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only boost productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own work@@ wise .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best above the menu tool bar . use and adding differ . adding tool bars will be treated at the bottom of the tool below .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , which can be done with new action , a new tool bar , or tool@@ bar can be done , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible .
by calling the context menu to a action ( icon ) on a tool bar , additionally remove the entries from action and action worked , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with tool@@ bars ... and setting settings .
templates are essential documentation , code sni@@ ps and files to link . you can copy , move or link any existing directory with extended organisation and interfaces . templates are in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you need for the file system .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions before each template provided precisely due to the use .
Bin@@ ve is everything that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted every file except text , images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually inserted in the storage space below global templates . further information about the templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually you will be a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage area under global templates . see also for more information about the templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always added to the documents . you can find everything from a comment via a final menu on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . some examples are in the storage area under global templates . see also for more information about the templates .
as the name says , these templates are available for all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a file structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
design a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and save file as a template .
as soon as it is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the storage area under project areas .
select text in your document and click the file as a template as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and placing on the build @-@ view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a pre @-@ level file . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and insert or insert via the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
one can click on a folder or in the project files build on a folder to the right and secure Site template , secure a name for the presentation and secure . by default , it is secured as a local or global template .
project objectives enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can attach head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; in addition , you can insert or link with them . in addition , one can keep some things in use of templates in projects very profound in mind .
the template structure in the lower window templates are based on the files specified in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quant@@ a / templates and templates . each of this folder is equivalent to one of four types of containers , as above .
in order to specify the behavior of a folder in the fore@@ word table with the right mouse button to click on the folder and in the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a radio box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden , as soon as the attributes is inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except for regular folders . if a regular folder would dis@@ able it , unless they were explicitly explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the B@@ lah would appear with something like Text Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a regular folder .
allows charging or presented text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er lines for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into one folder with special headphones and foot@@ er lines a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines .
in addition , you have the context menu ( shown on the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second inform@@ s the editor window in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor is as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - page and cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and edit the source code as required in the V@@ PL code editor , which are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ours .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that simultaneously the changes are visible in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ous , this mode is already active , the key pressure of the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . additionally you can automatically choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation can be set automatically . in general , the recommendation can be adjusted for quick calcul@@ ator and a large sp@@ ot for slow PC .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags in work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called . this is what a new document with the V@@ PL ; this means you can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. stroke words for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the change of the in@@ half , e.g. keywords in the column names and keyword key words on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change about the list is possible just as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to attach an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is as in a word Processing , is possible by clicking with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is beha@@ ved as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and using a back@@ drop or ran@@ ch .
in the same way , the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way , as in the source editor , that the insert of tags should not be removed before existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor tag , must be inserted with text , any other converted anchor tag must be removed .
some tool@@ bars as the tables assistant or the lists wiz@@ ard are de@@ activated . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; for this release the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining breast@@ feeding systems . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ le@@ es , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style can be persecuted .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ ing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes made and at the same time the inser@@ tion had changed . another programm@@ ers had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts .
that of me used the program only showed me the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly had changed within this line . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps the changes had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could have differences in line and changes to white characters . later , any amount of further useful functions were added .
for example , if you would like to compare text quickly , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the compar@@ isons window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported , this is useful if two people are able to work independently from one piece of body and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to process the resolution of conflicts . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen photo shows three qu@@ ell files when merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you complete with the same and mer@@ ging full folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in file combination :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and respect the possibilities of current colour monitors . if you need to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no anger , if J@@ n changes the impression . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can simpli@@ fy the typ@@ ing work by simply writing the file names of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 / O Ziel@@ ord@@ ner k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder
the opening @-@ dialog allows the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection about the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last modified file . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file , if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences in two files will be carried out .
via the button files ... you can also select a folder . if you select a file , the compar@@ ing or mer@@ ging of folders will be used , but for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active and process . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file . you can also do this step later to the store .
the button @-@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can define options before you start with the compar@@ ing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text box . compare , text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in open dialogue you do not need to select files , you can simply connect the dialogue with the break @-@ kno@@ b .
you can also use pulling and insert : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains some similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar to these features , this would be a relatively large amount of effort . you would need to download and compare it into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can simply copy and compare the relevant sections .
note : at the moment you can go out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only the failure of text is supported in a compar@@ ative window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and remove text in another program as le@@ art@@ ing and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such a case , your original data may be lost .
in the upper part of each text box is the Info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every Info line has a little color . ( if the path is too long , let the mouse will rest a while on line . then a small aux@@ iliary window will display the full name . )
the three sources are assigned the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color that file differs . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) well .
links to the text is the interaction column . if differences were found , the column displays the appropriate color . if white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the processor and in a few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary column of the text , is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is displayed in broken lines .
the result window ( under the compar@@ isons ) also has a Info line with the inscription : , the file name and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ band@@ ed , the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to be dissolved and dis@@ rup@@ ting the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , each monitor must be solved simultaneously a conflict that must be solved manually .
by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group is highlighted in all windows , and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a jump to the current group . ) This group will then be the current group . it will be emphas@@ ized with the color background colour for current area and the left appears to be a black beam .
sometimes by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual processing , no further line is left in the group ; this text is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your opinion , and perhaps again another source . this text appears either in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er you might need to copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; assem@@ bling con@@ jun@@ ctions ; however , appear in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the window window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources you ignore the numbers , or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
this will navigate mainly to the keyboard and the mouse , but you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , up , down , page on , page , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . clicking on the vertical image bar can also be used by clicking on the navigation system .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ drive mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click of the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group ( as already discussed in section mer@@ ging and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool@@ bar includes seven buttons on navigation with the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ top ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture desc@@ ending / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ stream ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , it must also be regarded as a conflict . therefore , it must be distinguished between sol@@ dered and un@@ ri@@ mal conflicts .
to copy the marking in the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to automatically copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g inser@@ tion ) . if this is enabled , whatever you select , automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and copy the manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally write the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ ers are stored in accordance with the basic operating system . UNIX @-@ based systems use a line @-@ in feed \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a car @-@ driven \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the line of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not use binary files .
the options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and re@@ produced at the next start . ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also sets the fon@@ ts with variable width , but you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ic writing are displayed . if the chosen font is not supported , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in its pure form but would be smoked . on these systems , the button settings automatically represents an odd colour .
if this option is enabled , the tab of the tab@@ ulator button inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you enter or press return , the incoming line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board then falls .
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ ing @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the usual choice on the operating system used .
when attemp@@ ting to files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all complete identical lines can be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters will not be ignored . in this step white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car @-@ driven &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other again store only one line @-@ feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car sign are visible , but then , like a white character , this option must be de@@ activated . in default , this option must be de@@ activated .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) igno@@ res . in the results , the differences are still displayed , but they will be treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive after even smaller differences . this option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the automatic transm@@ itting mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ rest conflict is going .
solve automatic all conflicts in white characters by the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you are considering that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in the chapter to scanning the folders and execute a mer@@ ging . look for details under documentation to the directory compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file , if already a such back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . this option does not affect the current program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and restart , so the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally through the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option , all entries are used for the upper setup .
via the selection fields for the coding , a short notice that is the local coding . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has an inform@@ al character here . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences such as special characters treated and interpre@@ t . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can define which coding should be used to save .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files can handle 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress down changes in white characters in text or comments ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ati@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . depending on the selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . check out the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the compar@@ isons to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for display of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide if you compare the files together in merge menu . ( if this function is used to restart mer@@ ging and use the file names of the last source file as default for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart mer@@ ging , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example , for removing distur@@ bing parts or to correct the insert .
when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was given ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only at the line @-@ off . you may have to write your own processor . any input line must have an associated edition line .
the idea behind is to facilitate the user more flexibility while setting up di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .

while you experiment with used , you might be able to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions . you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ asca / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a showing , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several changes to once . then you can use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other . example :
instead of used , you can also use some other different details such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ E &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; allergy are different from per@@ l some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after normal pre @-@ processor are maintained for viewing and interaction . the further operations are changing only the data that the line @-@ down al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ right processor is the issue of the normal pre @-@ processor .
the processor commands are very useful , but , as in any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a file . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ adily compare and merge .
... for each object a proposal to merge ; you can adapt the suggest@@ ion before start ,
... can the merge sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes , without it really performing ,
... leads selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you only need to open folder on command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as basis . if no target folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to select the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
during reading the folder you will inform you a small news window over the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
if the scan is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and any file that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the file structure will usually be folded together . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrows keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
when you click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a compar@@ ative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window on the selected object . in such a case , the combination hr action will not be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about the problems of this type .
as in the above picture shows are used in columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
however , the color is identical with identical entries , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if you are identical to all content . then file the same color . with folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea on this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A exists , del@@ eting the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge may not be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge may not be started .
the synchron@@ ize mode is active when only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder , and if the option synchron@@ ize directories . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if needed for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of mer@@ ging ( un@@ secure ) , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange cannot be eliminated such mistakes can not be started using the folder .
during the merge , a file is working after the others . status column indicates that when mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other messages when the merge is complete , you should make a last review and see whether the status is OK .
when setting up the compar@@ ative analysis of full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three files are compared or merged . )
you can select either the selected entry ( file or oc@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not have a target folder , then it is used in the three @-@ file meeting mode C as the goal , in the two @-@ folder combination , A and / or B is used as a target .
if you select a target folder , please check whether all entries should be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options in particular entries to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key abbrevi@@ ation ) . to bring only the current record : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if due to conflic@@ ting data types , still invali@@ d merge actions exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ts elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you assemble all entries , a dialog window appears with the options , sim@@ ulate and break .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen if you really want to make the really changes . you will then receive an exhau@@ sti@@ ve list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then runs certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( lead to a single file ) , then a merge window ( see the screenshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select once again directories / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you still do not have saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then it runs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue his work with the next post .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some errors that will help you to test the cause of the problem , or make the problem to solve a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other way before you continue with merge .
if some entries were individually assembled individually , this records ( in the current session ) and leads them together in later , these entries will not be saved , or not saved , these entries will be dealt with . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that fit onto the specified pattern are displayed in the elem@@ ental pattern . you can separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element @-@ tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element @-@ tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ res files that will be ignored by CVS . many autonomous files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this file can be set @-@ specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signals file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a directory attribute . in other file systems a printed point . a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the element @-@ tree or not . this option is switched on default .
for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to the links . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is switched off , the links like normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ) will not pass on possible records . a link to itself would lead to an end loop and crash@@ es ( crash@@ es . ) This option is switched off in default .
a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics of statistics . ( the number of deleted , un@@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower if it is applied to files containing no text . ( type an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders across a slow network , it may be faster , only the change date and the file size is to compare . this speed advantage is however a certain degree of security . please be careful with caution . this option is dischar@@ ged in default .
similar to confidenti@@ ality of date . there is no real comparison to date . these files are considered identical if they are equal . that can be useful if copying the date of change . please be careful with caution . this option is dischar@@ ged in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and not a target folder . in this mode the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the copy of the newer file as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because the other file has not changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or a file is replaced or delete , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ original if an old Backup file is deleted with the .@@ original extension already exists , so it will also be deleted without any backup . this option does not only merge full folder . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder co@@ aches remains visible to the merge single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window in the window menu , you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file via double @-@ click . however , there is also a single file directly into the merge menu . as soon as you save the file , the status is stored and the file will not run once again if you launch the folder .
however , this status goes out however if you read the directory again : directory @-@ menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sla@@ ves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can open files and folders that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local file .
a URL has another syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be observed :
a path can be relatively . or .. included . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a brief list of limitations :
or can &apos;t be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder . then , it will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit auth@@ oriz@@ ations or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( please note the option of confidenti@@ ality of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently being the differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a K@@ Part , the patch file consists of the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . also this is un@@ reliable if the original files has changed since generation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the compar@@ isons of folders will not support in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is com@@ promised ) already . also the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot as I looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers that went on or go there so much .
you have previously compiled the program from sources and configure the configure PRE@@ F@@ IX in / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more detailed information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters varies , these lines are treated as identical as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is treated , the line will not be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines of next to Each other , this subject , but this is the case of the case .
the editor remembers any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is simply lost if the result is simply stored as text file , and it is too much effort to design an extra file format which could store this information .
the effort to have been so far too large . you can always re@@ produce a specific version of using a source A / B / C . in order to process larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ t ; appeared and the text can &apos;t delete it . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to draw from differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !

cut out into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or um@@ ber @-@ insert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board on the current cur@@ ry position and replaces the current mark .
only differences are shown : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder &apos;s structure , and therefore do not appear in the target file .
( in the current program version , you need to read the folders with the function updates . )
there are only entries to display the differences . if the target file does not contain these files , they are missing after merge . ( the behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to choose from the source with labelling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed from the button to the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ takes in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual work areas . it is quite convenient to rev@@ ise the ongoing programs on the working areas , to finish their size , stop it or move it . this works both inside a desktop as well as in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can all virtual working areas as well as displaying the current applications . applications can be selected and even move on desktop and other .
with the medium mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only appear only the two entries in P@@ ager . however , the context and the name of the application as well as the names of the application as well as the entries , maxim@@ ize , on Desktop and Finish . the following commands have the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when cli@@ cked on a application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on a application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also be moved to other working areas .
when this field is crossed , are displayed in the &amp; p@@ ager ; the name of the virtual work areas are displayed .
crossing this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work areas . together with its name , the names are equipped with ordin@@ ances , &amp; eg ; 1 . mind .
when this field is crossed , the background every desktop is also displayed as a background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , running programs will be displayed as small windows in &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty work@@ spaces are displayed in order to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the program window . icon displays the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program icon . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ Haupt@@ f@@ enst@@ ers will be determined : in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , how from P@@ ager applications appear in some other Windows applications ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work surfaces are in a horizontal row , which is very good for the representation at the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the windows as icons or with their content . furthermore , it runs out of the control panel .
Click the right mouse button within &amp; p@@ ager ; and subsequent retri@@ eving the switch ... leaves the dialog settings .
currently , this can not be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you &apos;ll need to register as user root or register to your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the keys win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and as@@ sign this a value . possible values are :

&amp; mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding around new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you prefer to start , a window as pictured above . shows the enlarged section of the screen . in the following this window appears as an enlargement window . in the following this window appears as an enlargement window . in the following , this window is displayed as an enlargement window . in the following , this window is referred to as an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting is enlarged &amp; k@@ mag ; the range around the mouse poin@@ ter as a movable magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to show a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter on the screen ( eg ; on the left of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter out . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done by the following ways :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can shift the contents of the magni@@ fying glass . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you use the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firm and just move the lower right corner .
&amp; may ; possesses a lot of functions . you can also send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to insert into a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts and stop the updating of the display . the stop of the updating causes the required CPU time against 0 .
select the Update Rate ( Very low , low , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse pointing a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive strain In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and of which any mouse click pain@@ s . moreover , it requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can you handle the pain that arises during the mouse to cause pain . unfortunately , you can cause pain that are related to your computer with the use of your computer , you should look for a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should avoid pain that arise when clicking with the mouse , it is us@@ eless against pain that applies through the mouse because of the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be dimin@@ ished for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click immediately after breaking the movement shortly .
if the smart spl@@ ash is enabled , making &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break , after rele@@ asing the mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling on a pressing mouse button . the smart spl@@ ash requires a little practice , but you get used quickly .
after the end of the maus@@ oleum , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should be carried out after the end of the maus@@ oleum .
if Intel@@ li@@ ant shift is switched on , the turning field is set ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should be waiting before the mouse button is waiting , if there is no need for the mouse button .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now this function is activated , followed by a break , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can reduce &amp; K@@ DE ; to add the reaction time , go to sound &amp; multimedia , select sound system and here the hor@@ semen . there is a shift sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this feature is currently only below &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other win@@ dow@@ ments , please enter the respective documentation to find out how you start a program automatically .
set all settings back to the values that were set in opening of the dialog . have you already pushed the button on the button , the settings are reset at the booth after the last pressing of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the default settings . in particular , using the settings . in particular , if you have used the automatic mouse click here , you can later move the smart push .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; with sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or spots in brow@@ ser@@ window , which do not represent a link , you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is bu@@ ck , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the pages of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can scratch easily with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started using this case . if you &apos;re in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the operation can &apos;t stop by letting the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click . this is reset by the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; back and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to make it . however , you can &apos;t manage the mouse on a neutral field of desktop . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart camera but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it and again add any other action to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board , but it will probably cause problems with them . here are some advice for this :
use the intelligent shifting if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to use . mark text instead like this : perform a mouse click on the other end of the text area , while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is always played every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button lets you play a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent drive without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it must be installed on most system already .
the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers that are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; actu@@ ated the mouse button soon as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter shortly . this program has been developed for people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome , and to those who have prepared pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to create a certain time that a pulling process begins to get rid of the mouse button . in this way , the pulling and shut@@ down can be carried out using the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the silent user can talk to their computer for itself .
with the program &amp; mouth ; you can easily speak the computer for yourself . the user can choose from a list with the talk of talk , which should be spoken once again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen photo ) , enter the command , which later is used for the language output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dial@@ ogs .
on the second side you can choose the standard text@@ book text@@ book . you can often use text pass@@ over , without them to type . text passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( rectangular screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ ati@@ fication . in addition , you can compare the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the vocabulary with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elling words can be recorded in the word of word .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly explained and basically a input field for the keyboard of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field in the screen photo ) and a cross @-@ memory of the already spoken phr@@ ases ( the upper white field in the screen photo ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; properly set , you can type in the input field that you want to hear . any spoken set will be attached to the drive memory . you can select from the phr@@ ases that should be spoken once again .
with the menu entry Settings menu ; set up ... open the installation dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output , and settings , the page word &apos;s word and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field of the map language issue , enter the command to call the language level . in the radio box , you put the character encoding , with the text to the speech generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box when the text is not specified as default to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to language output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this command can be found in App@@ endi@@ x .
with a variety of language service , &amp; K@@ DE ; as a first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings are available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language is a stand@@ ar@@ dised interface for language output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box , you define the action by selecting a text passage , or by choosing a text passage in the text text@@ book book or in the bar for text pass@@ w@@ lers .
with the selection of so@@ res , the chosen text passage is inserted directly , and added to the input memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially registered only in the input field .
with the second selection field , you can define whether the text@@ book text@@ book will be stored automatically when leaving the editing desk .
with the selection of text password book , the book is stored . if you choose changes , the text@@ book book will not be saved . select before save , is &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the text@@ book book should be stored .
the page Vor@@ os@@ itory contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word transfer . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a radio box where this list contains more than a dictionary . with this sel@@ ector , you can select the actual dictionary to the word @-@ release .
with buttons on the right on the side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add them to export the order of the books , or modify them into a file . below the list you can set the language for the dictionary .

the main window of the window for processing of text pass@@ ag@@ ü@@ sters are two divided . in the upper part , the text@@ books are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key change . if you have a text@@ book book , you can only change your name .
you can add actions such as new text passages or books or selected text passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu .
the sequence of text pass@@ ers or text passages you can change the mouse to the new spot or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key change .
the chosen text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the drive memory is used .
the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . in case the input field is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the drive memory is used .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is found in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the drive memory is used .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged directly under the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sli@@ pped left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow cor@@ pse is displayed in the lower part of the main character with exec@@ utions on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .

probably you have not entered the command for the language output or not fully entered . open Settings menu ; open the page General Settings and enter the instruction for the language issue on the map language edition . ( see introduc@@ tory dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and more details . )
Festival is a speech output system of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ z are supported . the license allows to use Festival free of use and spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the language output , it is believed that Festival in the / us@@ r / local / festival is installed . the command to language is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS to use and spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the setup of language output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / us@@ r / local / fre@@ eware . the language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ eme into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to send the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / us@@ r / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / us@@ r / tmp / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / us@@ r / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into one line . this option must be turned on as default .
the K@@ K@@ DE speech output is a &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further speech service , all &amp; K@@ DE ; applications provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
because the voice of the language is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use a kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD language , which is installed in the installation dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the voice generator ) , which depends on the computer and its configuration .
&amp; K@@ mouth ; is an application that can not speak with people who can not speak any text by the computer . it is stored a list of pro@@ filing sentences which can always be re@@ produced again .
note that &amp; mouth ; no language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . on the computer must be a language syn@@ thesizer installed .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the language output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is one of modules existing service , which allows any application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for language output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with their applications using T@@ TS capabilities . also users can offer interesting opportunities .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor and Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in others &amp; K@@ DE ; applications are embedded .
the speech output is done via the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of language expenditure on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find the list on htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , you &apos;ll need to install program and install program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and properly . see also
when the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card speaker is displayed . see also if you have at least one speaker , the map display will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer provide various languages and voices , as well as various male or female , or those that are located in volume or speed . you can also address several variants for syn@@ thesizer . you should use at least one speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts , because the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher uses the default speaker .
different spokes@@ persons for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several pressure expectations for the same printer .
if you are clicking on the flash@@ card speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed automatically . this will appear then automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet any speaker .
all speakers already appear in this list . the preferred speaker appeared in the list . the top speaker is used for the language output , if there is no speaker .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the spokes@@ man in the list determines their priority .
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
select a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ ctions and girls .
if you click here , click on the new spokes@@ man on the map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
you can now use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to cart@@ ograph@@ ical map General and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , that the T@@ TS service of &amp; K@@ DE ; use . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read text orders , to create text orders and manage files . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the voice card system by &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the card reader to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options .
mark the check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this is successful in the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text orders and read them . see . remove the marking , will pause K@@ TT@@ SD and de@@ activated the T@@ TS system from &amp; K@@ DE .
when plan@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is completed .
with buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop , stop and record again .
with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; read cli@@ p@@ board or read a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for a contract .
Click on application or OK , then all settings are taken on all sides .
the card ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , please click on the Cart@@ e@@ Navigator General and cross the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if it is going to read , and select the text that is pre @-@ read , and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time , the language output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ tension lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text before reading , and then run the text , read the pre @-@ read , and select in the main menu tools text . then you should start the language output .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE ; which you will notify about you fixed events . you can also read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up various kinds of messages . for example , you can be noti@@ fied if you arrive at a IR@@ C channel when you arrive at a IR@@ C channel . you can then read the IR@@ C news text message .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the Settings menu . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to application .
filter for drawing chain replacement is a good way to correct in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which ends to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that can be sent out , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts , filters are not required .
in filters , text will be processed , before it is sent to the program ist @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation , or to choose a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; tool disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs in four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is pre@@ drawn to all the orders and holds these orders . if the edition of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has preced@@ ence and maintains the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the issue of warning .
News have the next priority priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . while you &amp; eg ; you can welcome a long text on a website . &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . every assignment you encounter with the map orders , is a text contract . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text applications . text orders are intended for the issue longer texts that have no special pressures .
all four order species are shipped in queu@@ e @-@ long , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a reading , this issue is stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern . they will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , and text orders , as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and give it to the next filters . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
characters can replace parts of a text by other text . the re@@ plac@@ eable parts can be delivered either as words or regular expressions , which allow the replacing of chat @-@ emotions as : - ) by text or for the conversion of news from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to transform &amp; kt@@ ts , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML included .
with Spre@@ aders you can send orders depending on the text of the text or depending on the program that send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have hired a female voice , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it .
each of these different filters is adjustable , after which it is applied for a language output . if the filter is fixed , its rules does not apply , he continues the text unchanged at the next filters .
if a text contract , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; message to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is processed by all activated filters , which were set up on the page below . editing will take place in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ er , and it will be shown below the following setting dial@@ ogs .
for the installation of string filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions than compar@@ ative pattern . if this pattern is found in the text , then the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text . large and small page will not be considered when comparison .
enter a name for your filters . you can choose any name , it must be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
Click here to move the selected word or regular expressions in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expressions out of a file , store the current list or delete a list of file , the entries are executed from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is used only if the speaker for the text order is one of the registered languages here . Click on the button to display a list of languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l . button .
if a value is entered here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID can be obtained via the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must be we@@ dge . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 is required , you can only enter copy .
the string bag filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the box can apply filter if match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in the comparison of words , the character encoding filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ding characters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no guidance to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ars &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ars &amp; # 160 ; you can find it in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such modifications . however , the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be installed on your system .
specify the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also available .
with the Spre@@ aders you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can determine that lyrics of k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter is translated , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is presented using the speaker characteristics which the program presented the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; and the features of the speaker card speakers are selected . with the Speaker filter you can ski@@ p the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied here , if the text contains the selected regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; K@@ DE ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions , you can call it with a click on the button to get help .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to fix the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the features of the chosen speaker . if the text comp@@ lies the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which matches the desired requirements , click on the button on the right to display the dialog box .
use these buttons to save or load or delete all settings .
the Spre@@ aders are applied only to the text , if all conditions with one entry in the box can apply Apply filter if apply . you must enter at least one condition .
the language output API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programm@@ ers of their applications , T@@ TS skills can give . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added with the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing them to use syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a brief description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of language output API by &amp; K@@ DE ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface by &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
this is the text of the text to read and option an language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; console ; window . start t@@ d in a window , then c@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supported me . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Per@@ former@@ filter set up , but when using the module for festival websites are not read pre @-@ read .
due to an error in Festival 1,@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , that if you do not work to read this voice at all . you can also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or inter@@ actions seem to cause errors to cause syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sets will be ski@@ pped or only cow@@ shed . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure the character encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . is there problems with certain characters or words , you may be solved with a sign chain filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which can be launched on command line in one &amp; console .
the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , please refer to the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; Social @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you wish to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , you will be able to contact the Develop@@ er team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile it , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; meaning @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ es , or download any night currently created tar@@ ball , transl@@ ating and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your language disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts . the program t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into single sentences . the user can reset , repeat , repeat the output or break down .
if an application is based on &amp; kt@@ ts , for example , it can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have a speaker created , whose language is English and whose sex is female , this is automatically the best speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , you will be chosen to see you in .
if you click on the map speaker on adding , click here to insert a speaker in the list or click on Edit , the card speaker system is shown below . as an example , the module for the Festival Interactive is shown below . details on the modules can be found .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to festival . in general , this attitude will automatically be performed automatically . generally , Western languages are used to use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you will adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch of synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers , and this gray can be displayed , which will not be selected from you .
some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded with their size . if you are loaded this check box , these voices will already be loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized by the first set faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have no speaker installed ( or click on the application ) . see .
if this check box is marked , the program window is shown at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window . otherwise , after the start , only the icon menu is visible in the system section , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if the check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr still doesn &apos;t appear , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . therefore you have the possibility to keep reading or otherwise control .
here are all orders in the queu@@ e listed , along with the application that set the contract , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the card ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can select sat@@ in in the order which is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not each assignment consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr becomes resi@@ zed to the symbol in the system section . Click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also .
here only text orders are performed and administ@@ rated . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component is not selected , it was created &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled for the corresponding audio module , or kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you &apos;ll need to install at least one module . if you select AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
put the microphone speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ ,@@ ; % about the double normal microphone speed . so this settings can be implemented , the SO@@ X program must be installed .
Click on users to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work out . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this cardboard card you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts :
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be moved to all the orders and holds these orders . after the edition of the Screen @-@ Reader was pre @-@ read , orders received received again .
war@@ nings have priority priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output from messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you ride the room .
if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ e is long .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound are active as well as the introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for news , war@@ nings and issues of screen re@@ els there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; glue ; K@@ Noti@@ fy news read , launch c@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card noti@@ fications will appear .

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard for the control of voices , the microphone speed , the volume , the sex of the voice and pitch . also marks for the control of the pron@@ unci@@ ation for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard voice , the festival is used for the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch will not be set at the festival configuration dialog , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and sat@@ in @-@ cross recognition filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this can also be syn@@ thes@@ ized as only the first phr@@ ase , as only the first phr@@ ase must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not to jump or cancel , even when the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are not directly supported .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is set up automatically as a set of a set of sat@@ in identi@@ fiers . you can add the settings or add further Sat@@ z@@ unlimited recognition filters .
easiest to simpli@@ fy the device selection , select the speaker selection , and select text to read , change the speaker selection , and select some features and check how the speaker selection has changed . of course , you have to have set up more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start with the pre @-@ reading , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you may then apply text orders on the map orders , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are not supported .
for these reasons , the normal movement detection filter is automatically created when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . change nothing to this filter , unless you know what you do .
with a regular expression of pun@@ ctu@@ ation , compare text with a regular expression of pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator@@ sign ( Dec@@ imal characters 8 ) to the sat@@ in limits ( tab automatically from the text is automatically removed from the filter ) . note that the standard movement detection filter keeps the character .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( adhesive ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the output of screen re@@ ars .
if you have removed the normal movement detection filter , you can insert this again by inviting the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the card speaker selection , you can ski@@ p the application settings for the application . the card card is displayed , if
use of the standard speaker ( the chief on the map speaker ) . in other words , there are no speaker characteristics .
use of the matching speaker , which has all features of a furnished speaker . if you don &apos;t delete the settings of the speaker . otherwise it cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from the most presented characteristics .
select the method for entering the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , you don &apos;t give it any .
mark this check box when the property has to have before other features . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output is , it will always be used as the main feature . the only case if you possibly want to specify the attribute language , lies before , if you know that a specific application sends text in another language as that in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area speaker , which is the most listed below , click on the selection button and then use speaker , which is the most listed below .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input is 0 necessary ) .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is revealed . the quality of the votes is generally well , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that will be delivered with the festival . would you like to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions regarding the transfer .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables management of network interfaces , ro@@ uting and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; box center can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in the &amp; menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; Network hardware can &apos;t install . physical equipment and their drivers have already been operational and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is an@@ cho@@ red and allows the setting of network characteristics .
in most cases drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices at installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . network appliances later added , the drivers have to be loaded with the following files , according to the kernel version .
the module network settings will be loaded when the network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . at the start of the module network settings , this , the platform used to detect the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform is not recognized , the h@@ ous selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and rele@@ aser &apos;s best . by marking the default non @-@ re @-@ qu@@ ire , this selection will automatically be made automatically at the next start of the network settings .
the change of network settings can only be seen in system management mode . before , all options are grey , which means that settings can only be considered , changing system management mode at the right end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the module &apos;s entire functionality is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three riders :
the tab network interface is used to manage network appliances of the system . all available network appliances are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the settings defined network interfaces can be addressed by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button ... in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings menu shows the dialog with further options .
with the selection of automatic the TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server will provide all required TCP / IP information at each system start . in the select list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP may be selected according to the system .
with selecting Manu@@ ally , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP address can be performed . in the input field IP address , the network net@@ mask is required .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog will be displayed as the properties of the device in the box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . you can determine if the address is already used in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switching off network device is operated by selecting from the list and click on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off . switch off an un@@ activated network device is activated through a selection from the list and click on the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net which allows the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks .
if your computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected , in which the Gateway Computer is located .
a computer support with DNS support replaces the respective IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the nam@@ esp@@ ace part of the riding resolution allows a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS entries can be accessed by selecting a contract and execution or her@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons or her@@ ent in the priority .
by clicking the button below ... from the batch machine to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button to add . the entry will then be inserted into the list .
from the batch machine to the name resolution , select one entry and click on the button Edit .... It is displayed the dialog .
the list of nam@@ ent computers describes host @-@ to IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily in boats when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . this is still in the test version of IP should replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer , and click on Add .... The dialogue new alias is displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host name and click the button . if the known host has several alias names , de button add several times and enter the other alias names .
select one entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The acquain@@ t@@ ances of your computer is displayed .
one of the following tasks can be executed , then with clicking OK , the list of the static hosts will be updated .
the settings on the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it suff@@ ices when &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with a graphical surface , such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient for this case ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only to be experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should afford this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given via basic network technique , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files will be discussed .
this area can not replace continuous knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information is medi@@ ated via the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . this description has never been expanded by IPv6 . this description is therefore concentrated in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge corresponding to the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact address given to a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can &apos;t be easily chosen any any !
when creating an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be switched from a specially for this purpose area to avoid IP address transfer with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore their use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be possible through setting of a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net mask is usually placed on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that is the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is required for IP transfer .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this section the configuration files are stored by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are filed in the various distri@@ butions .
this file will sometimes be changed in DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections , another content is defined .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by using scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ ony . another stand can therefore be expected .

to insert an environmental variable , first must be cut off or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then the option is to be changed at all . select the variables folder . then go to Edit insert .
to change a variable , select the editing variable . go then to edit variables .... alternatively , you can edit the mouse button on the variable , click here or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It appears then the dialog variables , in which you can edit as described above , can edit the variable .
to delete an environment variable , select the variable . go to Edit er@@ ase .
to activate an environment variable or activate , select it , and place the state with the menu item Edit . in an de@@ activated variable appears below description disabled .
alternatively , you can also select the mouse button on the variable , click the variable , and select that name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you have to save the cr@@ on@@ tab . select the menu option file Save .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or supplements to tasks or variables will then be active only .
it appears the standard K@@ DE ; -@@ Print dialog . if you choose out , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog .
print the cr@@ on@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users that have extended per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ on@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SI@@ X con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; used standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; dat ; is a safety program for band@@ ing works on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a band . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which set out my wife : how much longer takes it when you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be made by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen on three ways :
&amp; dat ; focus the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; if you don &apos;t know if the band is form@@ at@@ ted , you will be asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted .
recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ spell , it is looking for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked whether the tape index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol is changing for the tape drive , in order to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the ban@@ anas can now be searched for the tape .
prior to throwing tape , first must first be solved . there are three methods to evaluate this :
&amp; dat ; gives a change in the symbol for the band , that the binding for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding notification in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without a risk .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat it can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band species must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to save data . this process does not need to form@@ atting a form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process must be form@@ at@@ ted before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; usually form@@ atting a form@@ atting of the tape ahead , DA@@ T drives are not necessary .
after entering the belt called and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the tape . all the data on the band go wrong ! after completion of the form@@ atting process the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup , you need to select the required files . that can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in a local file tree . it will only secure this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile .
mark files in a local file @-@ tree with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
right click the right mouse button on the local file @-@ tree and select in the Sh@@ ech@@ em menu ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialogue you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to backup . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder was checked .
mark the files in one of the files in the record for the band with a bun@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
right click the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test procedure has been launched , the dialog settings for verification . in this dialogue you can check your choice and change the working file for verification .
if you confirm the settings for verification , the dialog appears to check this dialog . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process and the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ build the restore , the files must be restored , marked with two types :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or the sub@@ folder is restored .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu ...
once the recovery process has been launched , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialogue you can check your choice and change the working file for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to recover . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it shows itself as necessary to recre@@ ate the tape inde@@ x@@ file using the tape . this process removes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this is a safety profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a f@@ use profile :
the current working file , in which the backup is to be carried out . the list of the stored files will be updated automatically according to the chosen working folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , is that only the files are stored in the same file system , such as the folder . folder , which are on other file systems , you can apply separately under backup files . each record will be regarded as tar regardless of the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ kre@@ t@@ mental backup file , a snap@@ shot file is used since the last in@@ cre@@ ase file , a snap@@ shot file will only be saved , which has changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ eff@@ ec@@ tual use .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
the settings can set you via the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be carried :
the complete path to the device node for the tape drive ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variation of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the band is integrated , the command will load into the drive . at some drives it is necessary to be carried out before reading or write operations .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat to lock the ej@@ ection mode . maybe this attitude does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , when loos@@ ing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the band will automatically be cast off . use this option not with Flo@@ ppy streaming .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ fare block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable recor@@ ders . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it is writing a file to the start of the tape . this file should only be one memory block on the tape . the file of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the name : seconds , whereby the name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the period in which the band was form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar - archives created directly with the GNU / GNU / tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not deal with in@@ creative f@@ uses .
check the content of a backup device . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information on your system or where the system allows you to obtain information on your system or where the system enables fast access to information about problems related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background . it is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system sets the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems based on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features , which can be filtered and analysed the protocol files specific programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; a number of useful functions . among other things include :
support for many different kinds of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen photo , provides &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with their help to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easily and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; initially the most important protocol @-@ file system - to open it , and it opens up instead of its a small news window , so you don &apos;t have the protocol / var / log , for normal users usually do not have any per@@ missions to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or click on the filter bar . in the default setting , a string line will be displayed next to the filter Show more . then , a protocol line is only displayed , if in one of the columns containing the filter string search engine is contained .
you can also select another entry in this section . select the sequence of the filter search engine only with entries in accordance with the selected column files . select also in the filter bar the name of a process , it shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines , which were sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in default settings , and helps you recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a remarkable color as protocol lines of the stage hint . the color lines can be switched off @-@ set dialog .
if you want to display certain process only ( for example , in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command as for example to the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the option to activate new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ structures . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you have selected a window , select the menu to display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has an own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the source sources by &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; also available in the following folder des &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section takes some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it quickly develops into the standard for control of the system at the start of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and even more flexible than the traditional BSD inhibit@@ or .
I don &apos;t want to go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it yourself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why someone could try to create a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re@@ form@@ atting . this is why you need to make sure the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service which you want to start with the system or change to another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services are not such things like set@@ serial , which will only be launched only once . such calls may include r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie down to / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t want to use a r@@ c.@@ t in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel is searching for various places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard run@@ level is listed in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab of hand and change the 3 . if you have something to pass through , then you will repair it by restart the system and execute the following :
but how do you start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is one link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written so written that there may be an argument as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts in the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script will stop using the argument . if it includes a S , the script will start called using the argument .
some people wish to create a simple way to build machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level , which can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; I also could have a user Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the area of the available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can change scripts between Run@@ lev@@ elling and change the position within one levels by removing it elsewhere . this happens only then if they pull out a record from the area of the available system services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed if you select this in a new Run@@ level . to select it only on a new Run@@ level , you need to select from the menu Edit or select from the context menu , even if the same entry has previously existed in the target range of action .
the sorting number is sometimes not calculated . in such a case you have to edit the sorting number of entries , before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : there are currently no possibility to restore entries which were thrown into the paper basket . so be careful .
you can use the tab button to activate the different working ranges ( Available systems services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change sorting order number or name manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . connect the tab@@ ulator button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if they are available from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise they are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eln , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , such as system services started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution : please check if all configuration files are provided , which are required by the respective system services ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) just end without a message when their configuration files are not provided or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about Run@@ level , so that this manual may be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user .
after you have done changes , you must save them . either you will use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or entry to save in the menu file .
&amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and user group list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry . it appears in the dialog user and group characteristics .
some flash@@ cards are only shown if you have extended system settings . only if you are able to make additional settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , it will appear to make individual settings , if Shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD @-@ Unix .
the card password will appear if Shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD - Uni@@ xen .
this cart@@ ograph@@ ical map appears only if for at least a embedded file system limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alize ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , can be changed for each user parameter , whereby the restrictions are quoted in KB :
these parameters can be set separately for each file system . the current file system is chosen with the help of the field file system .
the card @-@ map groups inform@@ s about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user is owned , you will find in the field of the prime group . furthermore , the user can mark the user in other groups by adding them in the big field .
the Group &apos;s dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select from the menu users or group or click the appropriate Add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or delete the selected user or selected group works anal@@ og@@ ous .
with this module you can install the li@@ lo boot@@ manager , remove the boat password , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the default operation system , remove , change operating systems , change , change and more .
