<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated to the entire & URL; translated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, should no important decisions depend on translations without review the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites in the internet can be translated. other lyrics should be translated to the Babelfish-page itself, where you can easily insert text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & Konqueror; despite its low size, they provide some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & Konqueror; by adding this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For further information on the use of & Konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the Handbook & Konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load this modules in & Konqueror; select Settings... open the card card tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the KDE package; please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & Konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order to use the crash module, click on the & Konqueror; on extras. then you can view the page, the & Conqueror; to crash, or the list of stormy if present, deleting.</seg>
<seg id="11">The cartridge filter module (also called folder filters) can be found in the & Konqueror; menu bar with extras filter. with the module you can filter & Conqueror; 's current labour directory on different kind of filters.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM tree control in & Konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the document, for example: the element, all other nodes are subtypes of this root element.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView module; for & Konqueror; represents another view of objects using the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to check the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The specificity of & FSView; consists in it, telted folder size with the help of a so-called Tree map. each item is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the sum of the sizes of the subordinated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; reflects the size of a file or file size, the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries is defined. in this way, large files can be easily detected, even if they can be seen far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap-representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation use the rectangles of meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched on color mode, it can be either depth for the easy detection of casket depth, or the illustration of another file association as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can define whether they are displayed at all, or if there is enough space for displaying the sign of subordinarily, or if there is enough space for the sign of the Treemap. moreover, you can define the relative position of the labelling in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">When algorithms algorithms should be observed, the surface is proportional to the size of this entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this target will not always be held. it will be shown that less space is lost for the frame, if the square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As distribution of the area's area takes place to the subordinate entries, the implementation will be left. here it is for labelling and avoidance of space losses due to the frame, that rectangles can be created, which are possible to be square. the best methods of this regard are lines, columns, or recursive second allocation.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can define the minimal base area for an entry on the menu entry. instead, a space pattern is drawn into the area of the higher resolution, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinated entry.</seg>

<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local file on your computer. this path is stored for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders such as you would like to add. & digiplug; additionally, you will also use as alder library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as basic folder. & digiplug; considers any subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the passage of the folder you will get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digious; duro stimulates the library of the library in its whole depth. you can't leave subfolder, unless it came in a clocked folder. this allows you to add extraordinary & digiplug; perform a point before the name of the board.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take a existing folder with photos as a basic folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have photos as icons. this will then be used as an album symbol. this will then be used as an album symbol. further details will be found in the section albums.</seg>

<seg id="72">How to do this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh-Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera station will be available to you with your digital camera and supports your photos directly in & digiplug; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, every medium and any card readers, which is supported by your operating system, will work with & digiplug; together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) is used for the actual transmission of the machine. the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras can also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; uses the program gPhoto2 for digital cameras, which is a constantly expanding number of digital cameras supporting digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need additional driver.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for its communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers about the serial port are now outdated. & digiplug; supports these cameras and runs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support provided to read the presentation images of the digiKam reliably. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2, you could possibly consult anything or the production could be very slow.</seg>

<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday images can be quickly found on your location. if you were interested in one year several times the same place. if you're using enough photos, then you'll be able to print folder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. you can then print a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% of the archives and 5% workfiles will not be organizing and you will not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. separate from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are searching for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option in the installation page of the metadata in & digiplug; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently store the metadata out of the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? it shows & digiplug; to them a metadata Editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you need to select any photo words, labelling and an evaluation. of course you can choose all images that will need the same attribute and then set the value then. this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now be able to proceed with keyword, key words, as you can proceed in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogged images from another source with embedded images, then it's not a problem and can simply insert the images to the right spot. the changes of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply move through the pull of a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are taken from & digiplug; updated while the underline is followed.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics displays like different metadata. this is a very rough representation, because each block of metadata consists in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar dates are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool to catalogze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They want to just let them see your photos only, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="163">Check out this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you this of the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy 60 years after landing, memories, the historical time span is present again, you may even hear the silence. so the labeling has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself. if you show images, you should tell a story. remember, the key is the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive which you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's ok if a picture is not perfect, if the strength is only with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can also save a lot of text in an international alphabet (UTF-8). you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE will even export it to your wishes to the labelling and / or the title of the web-gallery system. you will have to tell the history so for the opening process.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find out into another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation is now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities for geolocalization are already innumerable, and will be able to virtually repeat that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat the photos at the recording location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digiplug came to:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for author and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the identity of photographers, then the name of a company or organization is not changed. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonym for the author): associated with the author. examples of this field contains the working name of the photographer. examples of this can be the title, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a publisher of the car, it must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the Anbideterfeld to identify who needs. this must not be sure to be the author, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then you can see the picture another. if the photo is a bearing picture, then the group / agency will see the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they can do no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work can do this, in the image of your photos only of small interest. for professionals and Halb professionals, this protection is very important against it.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique. & digiplug is in the near future, a module for the stacking processing is provided.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnout errors, turnout, blackheads, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desastertification, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that are lost on the street or a fire. this type of losses are the same that you can also happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which have a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, they must also be treated more than a few years. of course you can also get CDs and DVDs into archive quality, you can get more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 pieces that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you believe it is in your measuring room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you can store good disks and good recording devices and do not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you have a lot more reliable than the cheapest, so you can choose to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you have just been written only. because of this massive protection we are needed for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they are needed for formatting, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">There's a convenient program called Isobster that seems to works miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged floppy disks, hard disks, Flashmedia, USB drive systems etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to store the Formatwar against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store up to 50 GB, thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. of course, everything about CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non-propriate format. read the media with a description, date & author mark and then on a clean, dark dry and before animals protected location. do not forget the data to read the next generation of media and software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disbandages retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk, but not the data. Google represents a large field study on the mechanisms of hard drives: disbelief</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks keep the longest if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperature control the error should not determine the most common errors. some of the SMART errors will fail to announce the immediate failure. these are particularly Lesefehler and shift counter. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is the case for the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to an electric shock before you have saved the files, but these losses are usually removed without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices don't make much, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause serious damage, complete data loss, hardware switch, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself before the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against rapids is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs an aspect of energy and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug bar. however, do not think any connector bar also contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for a overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it protects against lightning bolt and protects the devices correctly.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since a overvoltage of each cable can use to your computer, you should also make sure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers are also available for telephone lines and cable modems, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it can not really help you. even a failure of few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overload these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power loss occurs. some models allow them to continue to work up to the electricity again. if you purchase a USV then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as a overvoltage protection. moreover, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concern the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety with the cost of avoidance of this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be given you up to & euro; 40, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a little price difference if you think it's always safe to trash before you drive into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as a backup under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantity of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard drives, but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. furthermore, you have to send data on the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com are available online storage services. your free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in the case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year, you will get unlimited memory, which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data protection, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory. thus they are desasterably safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system and btrfs represent at least the integrity of the operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not if this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain unnoticed that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocols is a much more secure data way than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable grid parts are another source for transmission lusts, because they produce interference within the data streams. these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is also available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still the alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms as well and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% at work systems. at notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Loss of data loss due to viruses is less common than most. it leads to a lower damage, for example, theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux; it has been no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less due to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. a very good English article here will find you here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, just the speed of the investigation process in sudden disruption is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the largest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is that while the technology continued to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already deteriorated for compact cameras and the final results are the optimization for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is now available for 100 & euro; so you are no longer affected by any data loss. so you can make sure your data often be affected by a plan and test this backup before you can make any more dangerous than the reinstallation of your operating system, exchange plates or change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you do daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you, if the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot. forget the aircraft accident: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect all the space or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasterlection means a non-local storage. bring your safety up the stairs to the neighbouring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above already said is a more common reason for a loss of data loss. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be backed up. this is a moment of time without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: backup of the files changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete moment of time for two time points: the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Inkrementary backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. this backup can restore the original status at any time again. this backup comes to a versioning system at the next with the exception that it is closed and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer transcripts to only change the difference of files that really changed. this happens to be compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Assure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optically medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore again. at the same time you come for a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a moment of departure for each month. each additional dilution should be done, after which you have a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC data, associated, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visible devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years, that is about the period of time in which you are really interested in you because you remember your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you have to consider and re-evaluate while the time goes. unfortunately, there is no other possibility to use as the current system backward. if less variants you have used in the past, the more easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to read your images, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and safety technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increase.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to increase on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and put it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">= / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC & Dollars; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBER; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & Dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of rice FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format disappears the slowly from the market. it should therefore no longer be used.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard designed for GIF. but it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadcity data for improved colour transfer information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format we would recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can store images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open resource format that is designed by Adobe Systems. DNG is based on the TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use a handful camera manufacturer DNG is now available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic of XML and RDF. the file information is available with the expansion & quot; .xmpquot; saved for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer it before an original of your recording, mostly in the shell format, for archiving. XMP is fit to edit the metadata separately from the image file. but it can also be noticed by the link between the metadata file and the image file. so you should consider whether you use DNG as container and place all there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards. the DCMI-communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarify efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your shell archive. this feature is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive work you can use external programs. if you come back the images again with & digiplug; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off under circumstances of other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright law with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgaleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; in the section adding a photos to an album, you can add a description of how you can already add on your hard drive. however, the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendate bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect these with the computer, turn the camera on display mode and switch them. another description will be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is manufactured, a ferocious indicator is displayed at the bottom, and the presentation images of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, file names and a symbol for file association settings will appear for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to download the camera information on each entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a details and its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialogue shows file characteristics and the photo information attached to the internally of the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded from your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer, GPS, etc. of the picture. these information is the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of & digiplug; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then download the selection from your camera into one single album in & digiplug; in downloading the photos are not deleted, and we recommend you to check if the pictures can be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the selected optional features of & KDE; as soon as you select the photos, use the button to download and then choose the selected files. the button chosen is as long as you chose some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this is an option New download. these pictures have been downloaded until now not & digiplug; in this case, the new pictures with a star in front window is marked. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download or download the buttons all or selected files, a dialog box will appear in which the photos are stored. the list of existing records will be displayed as normal stealing. select the list of existing albums, then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you select the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you've downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. if you want to delete the button delete all. if you only want to delete a few, you must select this first and then delete deletion chosen.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility of making photos that you deleted from the camera. you should not be careful if you want to delete the photos successfully in a & digiplug; if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera, you should make sure that this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames as filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful, after you upload photos of various recording criteria into the same album, so it can be useful to integrate the date and time to integrate the image in which the image was made, into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and reflections of the picture and for data bases. if you use this latter option, automatically generate a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options While the transmission opens three more options to be carried out before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another file format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% d% d% H:% M:% S. turn the option & time to add. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the commands.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filenames option, you have the possibility to change the filenames in small letters, or if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the digiplug; used for a photo, is displayed below the name, which the camera is available in the preview. your settings are stored and automatically used, if you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& Wait; can you use any information on the camera to the timing of the camera to perform an automatic turning during the subjection. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section of side bar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic turning is normally switched on, and when your camera fails to deliver this information, the photo can be turned off, use the button Extended and select the automatic turning in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made information about the date that the photo was made available, it can be done & digiplug. all images with the same date are based on the image data. not all cameras are available in the same time. not all cameras make this information available. in the section of side bar meta data you can read which information your camera could have embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case you can install & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button Advanced and select the file-based underground lower at the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their machine to your camera is the button to download. select the file extension dialog & KDE; you can choose to select the files you want to upload. you can also choose more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is done, asks & digiplug; you, where the pictures are uploaded. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is meant as a general term used in this document. this is a position meant to be displayed in longitude and latitude. identifying data can be performed from the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo, or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to extract an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot where the photo was done, you can open a browser which shows the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digiplug; users just want to locate the site, or simply add this aspect, it's good to enrich the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how are the GPS data in the picture? first you should know that Exiv2 includes a lot of GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and maps. directly with the right hardware, via editing the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to geographical assignment (manual) and last about manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera which has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a couple who work with GPS receiver. either as card module or transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, but you need to save these data in GPX format, because it is the only format to support the geographical Position module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract data from images and GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the sign-on coordinates that are created by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& Wait; tries to give you much control over his workflows as possible. to order to access these settings, you need to set up on this settings; to set up on this settings, you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">You can select a preview on embedded preview or image processing. you will put the default behavior of & digiplug; firm if you click on a entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard didacy and copyright law. these data are automatically written into the respective IPTC data fields, if the option has been selected as a database synchronization, these data are written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for the editor of the photographer: this field should be the professional name of the photographer. this can be a freelance photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the car field, it must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to set up the photo. this must not be the author, as such as Reuters or Associated Press, then this organisations should be entered here as such as Reuters or Associated Press, and then the picture must be a warehouse, then the group or agency will be the image available here.</seg>

<seg id="289">Image labelling as embedded shades (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your pictures with the pictures of the pictures. attention: in pictures that already contain labelling, these are overwritten by the digiplug; overwritten.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all the options for information that appear if the mouse pointer in the main window above a file rests. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and audio formats. to determine which file types and digiplug; show, you can add the file extension of this list and remove. any file in one & digiplug; Albumordner, which is no one of these extensions, will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset, by pressing the button on the right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lighthouse of & digiplug; can be set on this page on the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and synchronous mode. however, you should only use different sizes and the synchronous mode; if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select this here. you can switch off the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underlying areas of a picture can be marked with darker or brighter color in the picture. these colors can be specified here. in image processing it can be switched on with F10 and F11 and switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling, the images can be encoded into a higher resolution of the luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the near Declaration.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG requires a fast calculator. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF file can be compressed using the TIFF file. this reduces the size of TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on the image quality because the default algorithm uses loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save losses loss. even if you have been written loss of loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digiplug, image editing was only an image viewer for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default settings are that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option with a minimal loss of details, this is a bit soft, eliminates this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option shows the image a bit soft, eliminates but the 2x2 sample pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white-balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic balance balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white-balance is not set. standard, it is a fixed colour balance, which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors, the effect of the second sensors has the effect that underlined images will get more details in the top-ups. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shlichter, so the parts of your pictures are embedded in the settings. use the setting of hitting white in the settings. in addition, you can solve some unusual results because they can reconstruct the shlichter in various rosatönen. last, you can try some of the missing information from the shrealities.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast satisfied like green and red. & gt; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still not filled blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the possibility to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adapted for each image separately.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. you'll probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1. this can also be taken later in the image options of the & digiplug; -image editing will be too small to keep you conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo process algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the part-filtered image sensor that provide many cameras and that a matrix colour is available. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">The digiplug-Interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity) was created. after some tests it was created as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. but it produces colour artefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lentils, you can place the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a color reduction correction, since you will be carried out during the resource conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates into color information and returns instructions like this again. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information such as color information from a color space in the other are so accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Question questions, if an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Slay here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / user or / home / user / .color / ICC where you can save all your profiles. & digiplug; examines this folder during the Starts.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles You have the ability & quot; default squot; for your profiles to rear. everything can change during opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color administration view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures color administers not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model you can use. not all profiles are created on the same way. currently dcraw Gamma does not apply for conversions at 16-bit depth. this means you need to carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your printer would have a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are very satisfied with you. this could be manually correct instead of running on the blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles fit together. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the objective: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & KDE; image viewer and image processing is supported. through the release of this interface, & digiplug; many modules have been written to cooperate with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you'll see a list of available modules. select the modules that will then be downloaded from & digiplug; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the Preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short command for tasks that are carried out by modules can designate short command in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI modules, you can get via the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the handbooks of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the leakau should be easy to understand. the upper regulator is adjusted the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other buttons switch on the metadata, respectively, which are burned at the bottom of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all the cameras supported on the left side. if you want to use a camera connected to the computer, you know that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in picture display mode. these are currently serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path to USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you select a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / gaze, specify when you hang your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, put them in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digiplug; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after having set up your camera, your camera appears in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. in the menu cameras of the main window are displayed. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for relocating &gt; images in the trash cans, you can set the talk of & digiplug; when deleting a photos in an album, you can find more details in the deletion of a photos and deletion.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be used silently by & digiplug; otherwise, if you use the option changes in the right side bar without back inqueries. otherwise, you must apply changes to the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also add the indication of the welcome panel of & digiplug; in subtypes, it can accelerate the starting line of & digiplug;</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting up to new photos search for new photos. this extended the start time according to new or deleted albums / photos. this extended the starting time of & digiplug; if something comes from the base folder, asks & digiplug; you, whether it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different colour schemas can be used in & digiplug; used to adjust the main window to suit your taste. this settings can choose from the toolbar. a preview of available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digiplug, please find further information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use these images to view and improve your photos and to the correction of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the updated advertisements / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image machining contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. so, some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; for example, you are not part of your distribution. further information on the KIPI modules can be set in section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current data number, magnifying factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for fast access to the most common features.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions change your photos. however, the functions will change the original photo before you can save the file saving or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can't restore the original photo anymore once you have stored the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your picture before you can change it. you can save with file save as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not stored the photo, you can restore the original image to restore from the menu file and restore the button to restore the image editing in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have performed at the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of the image processing can be reversed and restored. the final action can be reversed by selecting reactivating or reproduced by selecting editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make sure the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -z to restore and Ctrl; -Umpfalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; you can press your context menu in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are made between also reversed and reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have launched the image processing, you can use the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image under or the entries in the menu file. if you have modifications to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out in the toolbar you can use Ctrl; mouse, or symbols in the toolbar or entries in the starter menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnifying factor automatically.</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want to use the tool bar in the normal view. if you don't want to see this in the installation dialog by & digiplug; change the main window. see the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print it in the menu file image and get the standard & KDE; printing dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases. you can only select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exporting printer assistance. if you follow the wizard you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug; main window has a side bar at the right edge, which is important information and actions for the selected pictures. the same side bar is available without the navigation devices, even in image processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider lets the side bar appear or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can insert labels with unlimited size or insert. note that the text is encoded with UTF-8. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you may be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters cut and special characters are formed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should notice these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented on, you will use either the button, or change the button simply to the next image, which will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user-button there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata out of the selected file or the database. but this is always performed if you choose a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation review shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting order. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the sides of the sidebar. in order to evaluate several pictures simultaneously, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field. coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view is a search box for filtering of the keywords, the sample-tree and a selection box with previously used in this & digiplug; session used.</seg>
<seg id="362">The sample-tree is adapted dynamically to the first search word. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief at the input of keyword in a photo series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. all of them are stored in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the sample-tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection, if you want to choose a selection with a keyword, please read the sample filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar sample filter is used to change the selection of the main windows displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar will be used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search intentions. if additionally, one or more sample filters from the right side are used, only the cut quantity of these two are displayed. all displayed words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and dismantle. if you have selected multiple images in the main view, you can simply draw it from the right side bar and put on the selection. subsequently, a dialogue that you will ask whether you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on no keywords, which was selected to the selection of three images. they were drawn with Ctrl + a and after that, a sample is drawn from the right-sample-tree to the selection and left. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes will take place at each start of the program. it can also be turned off under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created it and determine that it should be one or its, you can change this easily with a double-click on the text and the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is sought in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can choose a extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB, and you will not want to store the images in the full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mostly adapted to & digiplug; s created concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colorfully administered workflow. you can reach a tabled deviation from your camera or scanners. with a colour administered workflow, you can print the colors on your monitor and the colors that you print or in the web will publish them from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes on color management, everyone wants to express what buttons it needs to express for the results that he wants. unfortunately, color administration is to provide you with sufficient information about colour administration. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so you will get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your photo workflows are fulfilled every six below, then you don't have to worry about colour administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are via e-mail or the web where the RGB-de facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if the RGB works so well and the life for all so easy, why should one use a different colour space and therefore have to make a thought about color shading things?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limiting of sRGB compared to the colors we really can see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the hufeisenical region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger farms, please visit Bruce Lindblooms side and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to push my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the RGB colour space or not, you have to work your monitor, as sRGB you have to work out. if you're working as the color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, then use a fitting monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool produces five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. use it before you try further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, unequal, automatic abbalance and contrast extend from the menu Korrigorous Automatically correction from your colors to make the best. you will be experimenting with these effects to see which works best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the values above the entire picture, so the darkest point is black and the brightest item as bright as possible without changing its color shady. this function is often a Magical correction for pictures of dark or full bags.</seg>
<seg id="391">Like this method, this method is adjusted to the illuminator of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity can be as flat as possible. in this way, almost every helicopter range has produced the same number of pixels. sometimes this is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle with a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color range in red, green and blue canal. it determines the dark and brightest tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the complete histograms area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture by postpone the lowest and highest values on the biggest and highest values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The bald equates from & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly restricted to over a colour space with 8-bit color. so, if you can perform the white image in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your ways will be better to correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a bald-equilateral. it is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they launch it on the menu entry of white wines from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The presentation window can be adapted to the size. on the left hand, both the original picture and the preview of the tool is adapted. if you want to see the original whitening device again, it is enough to click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. Luminanz of the pier under this marker will be displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right top, a histogram is shown that dynamically changed as soon as you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful there, even in well illuminated pictures, most pixels are very small Luminous values. with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and Gamma. shadow alignment lets you improve the shadow data of your photos or dimentation down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image to calculate the color temperature of the white file. this type will also be set to the temperature and green values.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the bald-off with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed technique increases the colors if more than a colour channel of the Pixels is overexposed. this will be shown in the preview as pure indicator, and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and loading exactly this. any adjustment of the white file you can set to store this in a text file and store later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings will return all the filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings can be stored as your original. if you save this, your original picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the code depth per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding is also required for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG for formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue like the processing of rough images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tonic can be performed by the window for the use of paint profiles. a detailed instructions can be used for use of paint profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu of colours pitch. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always need the same error and therefore always need the same correction. in the manual, you find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you will find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect that was created if one had a partially developed pressure of a short flash. this was the effect that the brighter areas protected and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect to them.</seg>
<seg id="412">Intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows the image which is chemically possible. another increase is finally produced a negative picture that is not to generate in photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar process effect. the original image is the (1) and that is edited (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name dedicated to daylight optimising the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus making a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated fatty colors are also a few photographers, especially those who are scared with many landscapes too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight to contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neural lights. in large images, the filter can leave the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it's not unusual that you want to fix the colour console and the illuminate of the photos. all your adjustments can be seen in the preview. once you're satisfied with the result, you can use the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can get a picture with bad light conditions. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation may be able to increase the saturation instead. all changes you can do in the preview. if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leuchstrength / contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated to improve exposure exposure. even if the dialog appears very complicated in this tool, you need only the field of application only the area of the slide. concrete the three sliders underneath the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph, three sliders can be clicked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regulator and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side can be viewed the original and the preview of the image. preview will be dynamic, updated on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: using this selection box can be set if the histogram is displayed on the usable or logarithmic Y-axis. in pictures, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the linear histogram is of usable.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shadows, medium and bright sounds. moreover, there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two knobs used to change the output value as with the input values, for example, a slight picture can be used as a background, while something else is foreseen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this button automatically set the image values automatically depending on the aspect of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store up and store: saved with these buttons, stored values are stored in the file system and later reloaded, the Gimp levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input will automatically be adjusted for all shadows, means and sunny tones, and click the preview of the original image to set the histogram of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposure controls all the colour channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below, you see an example of the adjustment of the input applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the correct image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target figure will be shown dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selbox allows the channel to specify the channel from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols in order to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. mostly the linear mode is the most meaningful. for pictures with large areas of a constant colour, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short material to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds can be corresponded with dark ones and the corresponding image pixel is darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos you want to change a red marking. if you want to change this marker on the curve you want to change the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Store up and store: with these buttons you can do exactly that. any curve you can create with this file system can be saved and later reloaded. file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three colour pipettes buttons automatically create the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sunny tones. enable the color pipette to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of overexposed pixels controls all the colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you'll get the combined outcome. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminanzchannel. shadow and sun tones was applied with the colour pipette and used on the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel-mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel-out box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by adding the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be viewed by comparison of their own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target system has a red marker. if you move this in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram order to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction it will allow you to keep the general brightness. this is especially convenient if you are also able to activate the appropriate color components, since the channel-mixer then comes to the creation of great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a colour is coming to a visible noise that comes from the colorless. if this is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion thereby in which you can reduce the fares first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The store and loading buttons are used precisely for this purposes. any blender-adjustment allows you to save and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposure controls all the colour channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo shown in the blue channel. the Luminanz option is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was always fascinating because of your abstractual ability. with the development of digital photography is black / white a step step because color images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good for all sceneries and fits very well to portraits against heaven. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) Green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic effects of Heaven and can simulate lunar-moon for the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates hot bright and medium tones. this is very similar to the process of stay of a pressure and re-development in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digiplug; tool texture use decorative textures on a picture apply.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it's a color pattern or not, you can look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry image texture use texture use to use it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and the three-dimensional texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and changed under (2). the parameters of relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame for a picture added.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is no easy task. it is a psychological barrier to keep a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye. under the frame, the module can be started out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you put the desired frame type for your picture. through a thin line, riveting it turns with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), coupled with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal is added to a snail effect and decoratively adding a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: width of the frame in percent. the range for width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The frame decorated with decorative finish is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of images, especially when you cut the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple an formatted text to any picture in any picture. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type text device, orientation, color from the colour space and the character set with its characteristics as you need. the larger the image, the larger the character set must be. at the end, select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you've chosen for your text may be changed until you click on the button "OK" press. after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">You can use a template using the digiplug; tool stencil over one image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image stencil use in the image processing can be used to put templates about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For stencil there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should add to the compression size of the template's file size. if you want to add your template's template's file size; if you have to send your template's templates to the digiplug; mailing list digicame-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you have to set your stencil folder with the button basic folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the templates for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for stencils, a construction view appears to reflect the folder structure of the stencil folder. the selection of a folder updated the presentation bar of the stencils.</seg>
<seg id="474">Among the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the pictured image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button Shrinks the below picture. in case you want to reduce the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template on the whole image, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image under the template's template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the template on your image. the image will then be adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; represents three different tools for sharpening. each of you have advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates especially in dark fields, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharper mask works on the contrast of the edges in order to make a picture sharper. indeed, it is not a bit more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric darkness and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refracusze is probably the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without a focus as well as most digitalised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this also causes the digital edges a bit spoiled. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points can be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more retrospeculation than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG pictures often a camera has been applied for internal sharpening. images in the resource format, however, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpening device already during the reading of the picture. if you turn this deactivate, you will get control over your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool pull. you can call using the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should do so carefully, because the results are not very natural: sharpening sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general it is the useful technique for sharpening of the tool. in general, you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much simpler than it. use the tool to soften with the menu entry and experiment something with settings. the presentation window on the right side of the dialoges shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can see you here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help you edit the picture. this shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or amount increases the effect. if you create the unshark mask to be strong, noise and the impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges produce.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a lot of pixels on each side of an edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radio stations. they should therefore sharpen images to their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped picture a which is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The corporal value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. it can therefore define a minimal difference in this way with a soft shift between the tones of the sharpness and therefore avoided beauty errors in faces, heavens and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unparalleled masked filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a corporal value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digiplug; tool refracate refocus is a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected Entfaltungs filter Algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create a picture of & quot; it's better approach to sharpening the photo. it is used to use a technique called FIR Vienna Filtering. it is used to use a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. you can also start better results as unnecessary masked. you can start the menu by adding colors Refokusze in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding is far better than the Gauß's Faster. the Gauß's Failure has a very long tail, which is far away from the original quellular pixel. the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauss's Faster will even be influenced by far away from remote pids. causing any unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be very unsharp, but should pay attention to Heiligenschism.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce artifacts. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0,1 only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 becomes the image quality very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will continue the picture further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. in most cases you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformation size. however, if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The store and loading buttons are used exactly to that purposes. any refusername parameters which you have set is stored for later, and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all forms, color and intensity corrections on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately, but then left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally unsharp masked for better results as sharpening. this could be caused by a sharp masked for a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, there must never be sharp masked for artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never be able to remove the effect of the inevitable filters. the FIR Vienna Filters can always be seen at least just as good as the unshark mask. the FIR Wiener filters is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color pattern has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods for sharpening efficiency in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator is the inshark of the area of the dunghty, in order to create a more natural pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tintinte allows a customized color for the pupils. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool's image is one of the most developed tools to remove artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different default settings as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth glass of glancing and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be found that no sharpening of sharpening is needed. please note that the detail preservation is always subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Correcting movement alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothed evenly across all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film code or CCD noise will produce a high value of similar patterns. JPEG artifacts are best eliminated at a value of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor via alles. p then defines relative smoothing. therefore, adjust this value to the degree of noise in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter contains greater structures. the higher this value is required, the more the noise is needed, since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: can be run as often the algorithm. usually, 1 or 2 goes out.</seg>
<seg id="524">[5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected, there should be also small chosen. be sure that small angles should generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value so much and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel gossip and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more of quality you get through the choice of this option is only small. he doubles the running time. we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and store precisely this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file, and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how picture errors with little artifacts are corrected. the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a unique black artifact that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original picture is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digiplug was a very powerful tool to reduce bilisi. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts to remove staining from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensing from the camera or moirety; effects of clown images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about sensor types of digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a gracous noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the lower window details and the underwindow advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel and can be spoiled at the picture above the image and the color in it becomes smoothed and thus smaller bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the pixel distance from the filter to the front look at illuminating changes. if it is increased, noise tips will be revoked. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be received and noise, or dirt can come back.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value increases the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot be removed or noise tips can occur. put it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatory tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of darker areas, which is typically stronger, however, the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phasenjittering absorption. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius to variations of the luminance. if it is lifted up, the edges may occur. if he is on his minimum, noise and phasenjitter can occur on the edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store up and loading: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction which you have set, can be stored in the file system and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your lives. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected using (2), which was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is crisp for your purpose. it is thankful to draw the image a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen and experiment with the glare. the presentation window on the right side of the dialoges shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digiplug; photo restoring is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts of your pictures. it is very well-adjusted to dive into digital, original or retrospectively digitalised images, thereby receives the content as well as the human eye makes it possible.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithms can be used for color and texturing. the algorithms is developed with a different tool, the image error correction, developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Franconvey and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it creates some compressions & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are shown in the uncompressed picture. this attitude shall correct this problem.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and loading exactly this. any setting of photo restoring can be saved in a text file, and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoring is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce like a photo with equaling noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded using a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film code on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and the correct under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures was able to see an old color photo taken with an scanner. you can see the scan artifacts about the scannerlight and the photopapier. the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digiplug; tool Hotpixel is allowed to remove Hotpixel photos with a CCD camera, eight were used. it uses algorithms from JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw mode photos, because many cameras with JPEG compression is equipped via a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; there is no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First described as in the previous section, you should download the right dark image to the correct image. a automatic processing of dark pixels will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically reload this in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct within the picture. the presentation window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are emphasized in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels at the preview and the results of the Filters. select the best filter method for interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is obtained an average of the neighbouring pixel. it is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interaction, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interact the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block can be drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), then used to interpolishing the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), then it is used to interact the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original picture was increased to 300% (1) and the correct image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug was; Vignetting-correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. underlined corners, to correct a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo-format, can often not reach the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shakes) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light to reduce the sensor there. TeleObjective shows that behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be used, even with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise unsharpened effects are created through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effect of an infiltration depth of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a cterfilter, which is used without this filter. the tool Vignetting-correction turns the transformation using a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light staring at the point of the biggest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, or random a light intensity of 2, remot.Increase the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstrength, Contrast and Gamma settings: editing a picture with the Vignetting correction reduces the lightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the objective with these options. the controllers provide you only positive values, as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to adjust the refining of the goal of the goal, allow the values for light / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction to a picture applied. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct image. it was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lentils on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. coloured distortion cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flap on the edges. this correction will not be applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of gravity corrected the distant corners to which the second grades. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion may be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values kissenical distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the distortion. this value seems to be stronger than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter has the reverse number of parameter general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and leads to a correction first count by. negative values increase while positive the image size.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview of distortion corrections. the values you use for your image, are stored and used next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The metric tons or kissenical correction should be carried out before all supply or size changes. best, you perform this correction as all first. if you have a picture new and then a ton-shaped correction would be the effect of apparent the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to help you find this tool a vertical and horizontal supporting line. move it to an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in connection, you can correct the tonne / kissenic distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have to correct a kissenic distortion, the resulting picture black corners. you can remove these with the random tool in the menu, remove them from the image processing or across the zoom control of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the ton-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective so correct to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. keep the camera with the hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of Gennguru.org website that is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for a preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters to simulate film code and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator is changing the amount of film-grazing and the dominance of the colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels to the reproduce of infrared film mixes, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filectorate applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the sewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digiplug; filter filmmakers is an easy to use tool to reproduce filmmaking on your pictures, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers of large silver coats of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The filmmaking effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want to get rid of a timeless atmosphere, get rid of everyday life. if you want to see this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grained view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the baskets. the default value is, although common values need to be required at ISO-2400. if you still need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the filmmaking effect on a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digiplug came; filter oil paintings generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digiplug came; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil paintings. natural images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the top is choosing the brush size between one and five. thick brushes are better suited for large images. flattening the plain or, seen from the other side, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and this is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Gldeposit 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digiplug; filter coal drawing uses colour and intensity gradient to create a coal powder. therefore, pictures of their gradient are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what the scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper control chooses the pin size and the bottom adjustment the contrast (plain).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result may be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digiplug; filter Gravur is a fast tool to return to your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works very well in pictures with a simple structure, in which colour is not the most important at content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondarling landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of the filtration. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft 1: divide the picture in cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blowing.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time for calculating and create a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using impurities effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Imsharfe: wiped the image along sternal lines which go out of a center. this simulates the sharper camera and generates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial inshark: wiped the picture by turning the pixel into a center. this simulates the sharper of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: wipe the image around the effect of a non-focused camalinse. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement unsharpened: wiped the picture by horizontal movements of the pixel. this simulates the sharper of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photo, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft drawing unsharpness: wipe the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates pictures featuring a dreaming and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos, or add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sagtelegraph: wipe the image through random shift of the pixel and simulates the sharper of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpness: finds the color basins in the picture and wiped it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice small tool to make raindrops on your photo. this makes it natural your pictures a real appearance. it uses a pieter Voloshyn urgently protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows to change the size of the drips. since the dripping size is not automatically growing with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish changes the drop of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiplug; image processing a section free of regentropes. use this option to choose the range, e.g. a face that will be free to stay free. if you start the filter, the range will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filer. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirroring or turning into the right orientation. you can find the tools in the menu, turning turning or transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo vases is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase up a photo in a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you get a picture blown out and the details are sharp? how can you find the missing information or guess? the Cimg algorithm uses here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size. select transformers change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo vases was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to change the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the Reiter New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when enabled, if this setting is enabled, the new size ratio is maintained the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter contains greater structures. the higher this value is required, the more the noise is needed, since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and loading are used exactly. any input for photo can enlarge as text file, and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo vases is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can break the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below a sample for photo vases by adding a small color image to the double size. the original (1) and the enlarged picture (3) is the result of the linear standard enlarging for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a common operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. image editing allows you to create a photo with the mouse, through suppress the mouse button and tightening the rectangle. you'll see this rectangle when you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you get rid of the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut out. this way you can change a good overview of your photo. you can create a new rectangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle will create by clicking on the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting edge, use the button The Zuid button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file saving or file save down in the file to store the new photo-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the reserve area, you can change the size of the rectangle by removing the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio which you defined in dialogue will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool after aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, it is always assigned the larger value of height and in the cross-format of width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio is used a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always equal to whether you can use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo apier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below, you can set the range with the Max. relationship button to cut the range on the maximum possible, depending on selected relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio can be cut off its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are displayed the setting tool depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data can be mirrored and not the original picture.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of collision aid enable help to establish, so that you can make your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious parts are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide the rectangle in similar harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division that is on various natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the leaves of a sunflower. it emerges in all sorts of things we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already with the old Egyptians and the Greeks who built up your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you create your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci row 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the following divider is equal to 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition this rule will follow as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relief lines if you create a picture. these helpers are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will get good results for your photos. compared to third party the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called gold rectangles. this rectangles can be used to produce the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be just as being able to lead the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangle also slipped from the top-mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equilateral triangles. diagonal to penetrate these lines can be a static object of dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use gold triangles in order to break up your frame, you create a effect of professional photographs dynamic Symmetry. try your image focus on one of the seclusion and other visual information into the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you can't attain differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal mirror and verticals can be used to mirror harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a painting with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free press is a tool to turn a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens light that you can't get the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where the things came around an angle. you can fix it with the & digiplug; image processing and the tool-free rotation. select transformers free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the button settings you can reset the slide again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help the module free rotation is a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer into picture-looking for the two lines. after reading it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After taking a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function of transformation into the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">A elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatically. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the image a bit after turning. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations will be performed at a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. preview will be automatically calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new picture, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new picture, including the empty areas that emerged through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">According to the view of the perspective the picture will be a bit lowered. for an individual adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After passing the perspective, you have inconspicuous triangular holes at the corners. one way to bersome it is to cut the image with transforming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and the other part into the opposite side. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Make your picture by using the Horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press on default, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of Effective will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help are a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After completing the installation, the picture becomes a bit confused. for a single shot, this effect is usually negligible, but two shavers, and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After removing the image unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to eliminate it is to cut the image with transforming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write the formats available from your system and, in some cases, from the type like this libraries, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can carry a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. in order to run a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to download a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains the rest of the same time to the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, automatic correlation is performed in red. GPS track data will be recorded in GMT-time and therefore the camera time must be converted to the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. check here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation is a higher deviation for the GPS time and camera time. the deviation among them will be merged. the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have any trace data from a place for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the pictures. the difference of 2000 seconds will then correlated all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and differential in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location between camera and GPS is located, you can set these limits here and then correlate the button.</seg>

<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG coding can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled on the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally you can select a background color for the slide size. with this module it is possible to create a DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD file for your DVD player. to burn the mediums, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images that are packed into MPEG Diaschau. after that, you can create the module via Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures of selected images are listed under image files in the portfolio. there you may also change sorting images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you are planning to select the file on a TV, you must select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">Next step, you should specify the time in seconds to display a picture below. the speed of the image process is set among them. a low value generates very sudden, a very smooth glass change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background colour can be set up next. in doubt, you should leave it black. the name and the path of the generated file can be set to the name of the MPEG file file. it is possible to keep the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the film. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a coffee or drink a coffee in all the rest, if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that coding or tools are missing, so you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages across the right settings.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows to print several pictures on a sheet paper along with standard Photosizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your images stored in the RAW format stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it produces the same results, like the software from your camera vendors. sometimes you get some dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file that will be converted and start the module. the Raw Picture Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button you can look the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the convergence process. the first option determines whether the camera settings are used for the white-balance. the main parameters such as Gamma, Brightness and Red / Blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion result is equal and the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to edit your pictures often or later you should not use the JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">In case you choose JPEG as memory format, metadata files are stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the EXIF file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break down this process, you can use this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile-processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at once. use this mode therefore if you are safe, for example, by testing on a single image that are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, this is helpful if this is produced in an earlier attempt. however, a preview of progress is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of that can be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the image size from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image size or enlarge. in addition, four types of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the picture will be automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can set the printing resolution and the size of the photopapiers. the target pattern, including background size, boundary size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send chosen pictures with your preferred e-mail program. there is also possible to change the size of the additional pictures before. other images can draw on the list of showing images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures window will be displayed by you. via the button pictures you can add more pictures with a file extension dialog. for the last modified image, a preview on the right side is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw images to the picture list and add it to the list of the imagined pictures.</seg>
<seg id="875">Removing the button images, the selected images are removed from the list of showing images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all images, you can open the New message window of your e-mail clients with the button. you only need to add the addresses and the subject. those selected images are already attached as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many pictures on once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e-mails. it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and every time you will change until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you have to install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After choosing comments in a attached file, the comments can be attached to the images into a text file and added the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under picture file format and are the original files in JPEG format, the original exifdata will be added to the larger pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window is not automatically closed, so you can watch the status news on the search of errors, but you can automatically start your e-mail program. with the button, you can send this window? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions such as you want to display your diasau. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL-transitions in the presentation use very elegant image outputs using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graph card, otherwise the slide is very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file names indicate that the filename of the images in the left corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can manually start with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures accidentally choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so, it will not be used the sequence of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the images, the time interval between the images can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should exterminate the presentation your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly chooses each transition between the images a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diaschau, you can access a toolbar on the upper left screen. move the mouse to this corner for you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop and restart the presentation and stop the previous picture and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom screen, you can see the current filenames, the position of the current picture and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under KDE-Imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working area.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the lower frame, as a background for your KDE-working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have added your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & photoalbum; through these browses, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the image, now in any group, so in persons, places and in group keywords entries are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories that you have entered your pictures and videos with notes. in addition there are entries to look at the EXIF-based information, viewing the folder's structure on your hard drive and of course see the actual pictures. in the following will be described each for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse to record people, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are displayed, on which both people are shown. by this selection method, you can limit the number of images shown from a few thousand pictures to a few more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view images to view the images of your computer range.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & conphotoalbum; however, for each person a own image image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined themselves. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display pictures beside the name, select the button, which you can use on the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view of each category separately. it has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and simultaneously (if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to define the picture for each individual person. to view this, you need to display the image files window (in closer). now you can select the picture for the corresponding person. in the image window, you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and then select which part of the image will be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you want to see the entry in the main window, you will display a dialog box that is very similar to the dialog for the fixing of the image properties. this dialogue can be viewed at the picture once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string in the labeling or description, the labels or descriptions of the pictures are searched after this text. if you want, you can also enter a date, so for example, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, according to images, in which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user guide book for & photoalbum;. if you don't like to read handbooks, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photography album; and watch the quick-off, screen photos and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialogue the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry into the menu. then, some example images can be loaded and you can try the functions of & photoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you'd rather like to print this manual, please find it on the homepage of & conphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the lower edge of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of these Leif you can see here:. as the name suggests, this glue shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each rental show you another unit. you can switch between the units and months, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the LEICA only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactive on the following ways: you can change the displayed entries from the database (if you select a date, you will always be displayed the first picture of this date in preview icon) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and the mouse via the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data, pull you in the preview view just pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& KphotoAlbum; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images. integrated and the other as module is available (see). in the following part of the user name is available in & photoalbum; integrated version described above the menu file HTML... can be accessed.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of overprint and a description that should contain the HTML file later. HTML-sample pages, see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose from whether a & photoalbum; -export file is to be created on the review page. nourishing information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed. so, you can avoid that information from a party are obvious. for example, that all images are exported from a party. you can therefore not use these settings to hide certain pictures from certain viewer.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages are to look like. most setup possibilities are clearly, why this is not specially received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures. this allows those who have a monitor and monitor a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time you have defined. so he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which can be displayed on a lower transmission time, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, place the different folders and the URL, where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder, in which all your pictures will be saved. this folder will be saved and select the next time. here you can select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if this is really all right for viewing. if you select a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL you should set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In case that the HTML files are not yet stored in the final destination folder, so that the import function, see, right, you must specify the final goal of files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="930">The subordination options described above have all three of the base folder or URLs. in these, a subfolder is laid out, whose name is set in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, you may want to create your pictures with these images. you can, of course, have a HTML page to view images. if you are already very much time to view the images, recording location, etc., you need to do with & photoalbum; do not even make this job again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & audio album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties will be imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file is only one link to images. the advantage can have all images together and that file might be so independent. however, the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the menu file Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the images on two times. first you can't find the pictures that you specified in the file of the .kim file. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog box is described for the export of images that you can order via the menu file....</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialoges is whether it is intended to act in internal or external .kim files. there are the following three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you need to copy the .kim file option, you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatic near the .kim file, copy & copy photo album; the images are automatically copied for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is really small, it is usually not to compress the files. if you want to compress this anyway, simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option is to limit the maximum image size. if you are sending your friends images, you may not want to limit the images in full size since the .kim file might be very large. here you can tell the size that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you want to import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select & kphotoalbum; the exportalized database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to imports consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you would like to import, afterwards, in which folders will be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you specify the category people to the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is mentioned in your database. therefore, you will need to be imported in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported in the categories of the imported file and which categories are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example will see you on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to search pictures and view: if you see images, you often want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will run the various steps from (1) to the information on your pictures, via (2) the searches and look forward to (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum started as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been extended and today, there is also your videos. at many places in this manual is talked about images, but frequently this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal locking tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; note the folder, in which your pictures are stored and used to automatically start a different folder with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; using the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings. set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of & with photoalbum; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to you.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call the installation options and options for viewing. for each setting, an extensive help is available, which you can call through a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">You can also describe how to create different features for each image, e.g. persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog, which is used to work already existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a labelling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog box, you can set up complete membership groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a Midglider as stated.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the installation options, which are available to you at the fixed selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window, you can choose a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digiplug and Gwenview. this module system means KIPI and means & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. nutritious information on this page you will find on the Kipi homepage.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. modules can not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & photoalbum; but most modules have a help-page that you can call on the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Because the modules of several applications can be used together, it can be tested that the modules can be tested with the demo database, before you can call these on your own pictures - demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. don't say, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, making it possible to function some modules with & photoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage, if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & audio album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications can't support their pictures in records. even if & with photoalbum; this type of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules so you can use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, i.e. all images that show you the picture look at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & conphotoalbum; the modules also has a list of albums. here goes & photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry into this category is a record for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you have set in the installation dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you're using the category people, you will do so whether you have selected persons to view and enter the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are compatible with & photoalbum; not compatible, you can remove this from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select in the module, which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you'll see a menu and tool bar. at the moment we will not see a lot of information about your pictures. in the section we will show you back to this window, now click on the entry images that shows you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each image with notes, where the image has been recorded, etc. you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures of certain notes at the same time. if, for example, in the picture of Jesper, and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes, if you want to use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can define three lists with a text box by giving people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & conphotoalbum; because you are always able to use information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on shifting the images within the list: if you are shown for example a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people can be depicted, so that the names used are moved to the top, which are quicker and assign up.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get a alphabetical list of the list, click the icon for sorting under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen notes for each image, you might want to edit all the selected pictures and have these pictures with notes. Click in this case simply to the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be comfortable to mark all these pictures and use the menu option multiple entries to once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialogs it is possible to add a entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also get an entry to a category of existing or subcategory. attention, this is predicts that you can order your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the note dialogs by removing the LEICA, which make the upper edge of the frame, click and move it. you can also make your own window, using it outside the window section.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, you click on the button options... which offers you the possibility to save the current construction and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also miss a frame even completely. if you want to display this window later, use the button options... and then click here window an / out. this process will see you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the record pictures in your browser, you'll get an overview of the pictures of the selected pictures, or any pictures if you do not have a filter. an example can be seen here. you can configure the size of looking images using the middle mouse button, and try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as a background picture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is displayed in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. just select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the removing button or choose from the menu Edit. now, you will display the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Kphotoalbum; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the pictures anywhere, so that you can hold on your hard disk. in the picture you'll need to record the pictures anywhere, so that you can't find the pictures from your hard disk. in the picture you can't find all required images from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the pictures are present, so that the pictures of these pictures can show you. however, you can view the preview of these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this function you need to copy files out of the folder and copy them again. if you would like to avoid trouble as you wish to avoid the passing of your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to make a little more privacy, please filter out the images that you can watch for others. alternatively, you can also see all images that may see your little sister, taxes and the menu entry everything besides current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">Thus, you have set out what images are hidden in case of the case. if you unlock the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry into the menu. if you want to see images again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered for unlock the images. in order to set up this password, select password change in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please note that this image protection is not very safe if you can read or delete any pictures on the hard drive and to the other, this type of password protection is able to read or delete this type of password protection; not very familiar with the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can describe all your pictures with & photoalbums; of course, you can describe them at some time, of course, that you want to look at some point. for this reason, it has a picture _ and video viewer. these can be seen from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you can enter through the image, like who's on the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can also configure which information displayed and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. then, you can see the context menu, you can see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on the browser, see, matching entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will give you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you were selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons image high and finish. you can jump to the first and final image with Pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run those as Diaschau. as frequently it can download a new picture after a few seconds. how often it can capture a new picture by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or Minus. the slide is stopped by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability to view & kphotoalbum; is it possible to change the full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete pitch on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can simply enter into the image and get out into the image. with the Minus button you can get out again. with the Minus button you can get out again into the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the Point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the simultaneity put the zooms, so each pixels corresponds to a pixel's screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work with videos that are in and out-out with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu you can rotate the picture. this doesn't work with videos. you can make notes on the current picture with the menu notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures, you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can view the image and configuration dialog of the image to mark this name. but they may only draw the picture to mark and consider further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see what photos you want, you can start viewing with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you are one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, you are viewing the possibility to view images with traits as you watch them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letter. in the picture you can see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, you can see them in your browser. so, if you have any pictures you edit, print or whatever you have chosen ones. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or what you just want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can display in the preview site. if you can view categories in DRE Vorschauview, then you can add features to the images by pressing simply the letter for the feature after the image was chosen. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, it allows you to display your photo album; paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The old is not stored in the image, but in the database. in the way you can reset your common later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In case you can see a picture on the painted picture. in order to put the painting mode of & image album; just select the painting from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar on the window above.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering it. & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual has been written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the symbol Rendering The symbol Rendering in the toolbar or choose the menu view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode meets the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to rendering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert a lot of Render modes, from a quick preview of up to full images in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render, in the toolbar, or in the menu view Render Modi..., the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size, you can enter the width and height of the rounded image. if you only want to rendering a small area of the picture, select the check box and enter the image section of rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the features, the & Povray; for rendering it. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflective photoelectric sensor. an exhaustive description of the Render properties can be found in the user guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a painting with only one beam is pitted, various errors can be created. these pictures often have a moirè pattern or line effects in bends and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique of anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of this bug. generally, pictures with this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, links & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is constantly split up and adaptive because each pixel is steadily split by the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray appears a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color value is calculated with super sampling rates, both pixels will be calculated using a particular additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 will be charged with an additional limit of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 Rays per pixel. if the difference is divided between the specified threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 subpixel size, which can be followed individually and further on further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam, called Jittering. when you switch Jittering, Povray changes the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which calculates diffuse lighting reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object taken.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Open a new window for displaying the & Povray; Consolenant. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>

<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle in the camera view and in the window-type label.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object-catch of points to the Raster in the context menu of the wireless model views. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scalations and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Bigger values improve a more accurate wire model and thus a better starting point for the displayed objects, but they require more time to rendering. for some objects, such as the ball, you can adjust the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high details for advanced projections, all wire model views are further subdivided when the camera uses a extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions in perspective and vertical projections. this feature provides a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you indicate wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is shown in a box sample of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you indicate the ground, a floor is placed below the objects. the floor is shown in a box sample of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you turn canoe, the non-recursive antialiasing method for rendering the scenes is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more precise to the parameters in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window of window orders will be explained, as you can create and save window frames.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window arrangement: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of precursor arrangements shows all existing window arrangements. a new setup you can add to the button, and remove a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>

<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you will create a new column at the right side of the existing window, with boxes. you can't get a map view together with the previous view and floating on the main window, but generates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just purchased & Povray; and now you want to begin with more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but easy scene, among beginners: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain about that you can only use a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't have a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you add no light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faultless, see the first start of & kpovmodeling; the following pre-installed window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You'll need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols, as well as their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry, then you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model list shows how the camera considers the whole scene, which you create. in particular, you notice the scene from the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, you can find the contents of view object properties, where the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation about & Povray; please find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but note that the camera is able to change the camera, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click on the left button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button and press the input, the wire model views and the object tree immediately change this settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you might set a quader (insert endable body tader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an incomprehensible method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually, it offers a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite level as a ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in object tree, change the name and press the button. in the object-tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model list now shows the level, although at the moment only as a limited extent. if you rendering the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you check out the object tree, you'll notice that you can click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object: scaling, turning and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in view of the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should know the ground for exercise a unit under the horizontal line just so you can get some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to place its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue that you can choose to select how the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the object description (name = soil pigment), with a click on the button you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments show only a mash black material because you can still need to check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on quader and ball in the preview, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your picture right now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the color name. here are further settings necessary. in the colour list you need to enter two new attributes. then select this entry twice (you can also do this also more frequently, but the box colour list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the Object tree, select the colors in view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to run this step, as you have already understood the basic operation of & kpovore; already understood. the ball rotates just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object characteristics you can immediately change the settings. put the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input or the button to press it), so the ball rotated over the ground, as you have postponed the floor for a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, Rendering is now a strange result: as previously seen, the ball surface appears like a mash black material. put in the following steps a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you choose the ball, you can point a material now. as already in the bottom, enter the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the main object and change the name for example in ball pigment. Click on the pigment, then select Incolored and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach interesting effects if you take time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the application or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of gloss effect and reflection is already partially good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should have a good impression of it, which offers you & kpovmodeler; hopefully. hopefully you have learned as much you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracing from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera which renders the scenes) through each pixels in the scene. the Render is calculated as this beam can affect the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects are processed in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source, you can also see anything, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. POVRAY files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in default file dialog, you can select a file which you have done with & kpovmodeling;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu, and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. is it a new file, you'll need to enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene is reproduced in the last stored version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry, if you don't have any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">This menu entry is repeated. you can only select this menu entry, if you use Edit returns.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window arrangement and opens a dialog box in which you can enter a name for a new type or existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you can find options for setting & kpovmodeling; here you can change the appearance, the keepers, and the default behavior.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Open a dialog to device the tool bar. you can add and remove the toolbox with this option for & kpoveils.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to sustain rough surfaces without creating each diffle on the surface individually and without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models will then continue to give them a realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel-based application, using a picture file as color card.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-interface from Amarok has many general functions that can also be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists browser and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function break could look & b; like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command lines of Qt and & KDE; additionally, Amarok has some own command lines options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give an feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use box, so that the user does not run a script.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In folder scripts / templates, you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can quickly find it as the basis for your own scripts or simply notice the required functions. you will quickly find that the letter of scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange your scripts with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is the use of the command dcop; which any KDE installation should be enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; is usually called exec (). this way can be called dcop &gt; relatively simple. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends messages to all current scripts. this is why scripts should monitor their default settings and react according to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to preview the setup dialog. in order to save the store and loading of the setup data, every script should take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working file on the folder, where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signal that a new piece is attachable. the script might now be & zb; with DCOP functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>

<seg id="1194">Customizable clicks: submenu, Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist. in order to add a customized menu entry, you can use the DCOP-function dcop amarok script script addresmenu (submenu menu) to use dcop amarok script inmoveCustomMenuItem (submenu).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok on; ends, or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do so, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks Script-Administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2), which can also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension catocscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main descript must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have Kdelibs (included in the programs contained programs, because & amarok; requires some of them to find such modules or scripts). we have written a little instructions about how to compile Kdelibs.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features like the OSD predicts that your window manager will work with freedesplanktop.org. Gnome will work, but Fluxbox will work for example. we try to support amaroK on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt because these provide excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably, one of your files will make a bug in the TagLib library to days. you can see this bug to the TagLib developer in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok .kde.org and depend on the caputte file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly, it is estimated that Taglib comes from this file. please report this bug to the TagLib developer under bucc.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, please try SQLite. support for it in & amarok; is something more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure everyone of & amarok; used libraries to be compiled with the same compiler version, e.g. & amarok; with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.x, then this leads to the processing of meta-information.</seg>

<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically at a crash). if it is a frequently used crash, and you will send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many program write data as UTF-8 in Meta-Infos, but these are not as Unicode characters. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you receive this bug: catocapp: symbol lookup error: catocapp: unscreen symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixum, then check if amaroK uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen using ldd'd amarokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>

<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you can use the command program dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following in the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have common & KDE; program common, supports & k3b; mostly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-Interface of & k3b; features functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can create a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project via using the # dcop k3b K3binterface currentProject By using this reference is it possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the top listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is applicable only to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">The createFolder (Qstring name) of createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring trust) of addurred (Qstring path) of rendering Item (Qstring path, Qstring newname), offset volume ID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder est / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder est / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audioCreator; is a audio CD; -Elite for & KDE; with it all you can read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder the installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and supported by many coders (compression-free compression). more coachers can still be added to the program (if installed on the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, used by & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia is used. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coding are already present, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself. however, only the coders are not used to compile it. if FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which Kodierr / file format is to be used? a small introduction over Kodierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy of protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudioCreator; if not the firmware of the CD; / DVD device is not possible to avoid any copying protection. if not possible, & audioCreator; even do not use the mechanisms of Copier protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CDs; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only one needs to be done (the setup dialog but can be called to a suitable configuration), the daily handling of a & CD is explained to the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface that you are often stumbled at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats, depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freeDB file or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is collected manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands in the main character. on the page step, for example, further information, such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB request from the CD data is based on request from the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, in the latter case first to connect the connection to the internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts the reading and - if a encoder in the tab setting is configured in the setup page - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that you can choose from a different encoder than the standard. it is to note that previously the encoder in the tab setting is configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that a file extension will be selected, instead of a full & CD; to read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, pieptics) for programming events (such as reading the & CD; terminate).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog by & kaudioCreator; with different cards (such as Encoder, to set up the Encoders). you'll have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information should be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey', which may possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can use these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, which lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences are less important because both coders are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame will be supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high quality sound quality (with high Bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from any computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG-player devices are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - initially in 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list containing parameters to the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This adjustment gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR shared stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a Titels. well Genug for music of young people, portable devices and auto-stereossystems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this attitude will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you have absolutely highest quality without relying on the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are entered manually or run through the program automatically from freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can send / needed to create folder and file names as well as the attributes of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here. the manual or help to the coding explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD (English), when MP3s will be encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudioCreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download / enter the information, so that all the other information can be downloaded from yourself in the computer. it is to note that here only from text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (ante.) I'm not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist may be added to the music company. any information can be added either by the artist through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audioCreator; is active in a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems to be used with another (counterfeit) address. in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used for retrieving data from server (this can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many different countries copies of the main database. if & audio-Creator is set up in many different countries, the geographical server will need to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and like the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirroservers for the online transfer of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually selected monthly) only the updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which software program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used to search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CDs; see also that the cdparanoia package must first be installed out of the appropriate distribution first, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the selected WAV files, the coding and the desired file format can be selected. in the first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) can be added to the Code of the Kodierers. other coders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the responsible Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined coding. further information about Kodierer is in the chapter Welter Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, further information can be obtained via its switch through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device designation on your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give a hint on what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; please control the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the full manual, everything understood, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time and read all our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled package for the example with a search engine. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files that you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write permission (eg; by trying to copy something inside with the conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; something which is thought to be done only once.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the pre-reading of a & CD; what must be repeated for each extension & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the use of the compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to use the freeDB program to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to read one & CD at any time, if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device number is handed over to the read program that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map general settings. here gibts not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be stored / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In case of complete information please choose, so that you will be informed if data are missing from the keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The boxes CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and release the & CD; data automatically downloaded on the Internet of a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during reading the & CD; it can be connected to the internet so he can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD record; this entry begins immediately when you are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory / file names or day entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and file name is changed with counter-order &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter all manually, then disable the selection fields and freeDB will not be used. however, this is about 620 MB big, if you need to use the database before. for freeDB mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following cartel card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. this is settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server via the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section on freeDB. read everything as shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the site freedb.org and watch them after a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way the burden is distributed between the machines. however, this attitude will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, because many firewalls include the protocol 8880 standardly, there is perhaps more fortunate with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit data on the freeDB server. the first check box should be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author knows not so easy to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross the & CD at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined stewards for temporary files: if you cross it, then / must be stored in the file / folders. this can't be useful if only place on another drive is created. do not forget the file in a private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All as you enter on screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances, it needs to be puffed after right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned before, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is on average about 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the record '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 'tags can also be extinguished. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & KDE; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, more than a WAV file can be encoded simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, as the process of reading the & CD; on the hard drive runs out. we will build a connection to the Internet, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will want to pick up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each extension & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freeDB, the screen photos are a bit different than those for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; you will learn the data manually, instead of taking them out of the Internet. comments are shown on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, the & CD is now to be defined in the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window, as in the screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CDs could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding fundamental settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD is successfully completed by the freeDB, all the tracks are already completed and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case that it's more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also solve this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have any local database, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and the title's title</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update', the rest of the data in the Command box 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the Command box 'Update' title, unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual Comments inipell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful termination of the data from the freeDB file is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you do not only begin with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words begin with major letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and titles of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have set up unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioCreator; maximum. this option is set up at the Code 'tab'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Етикети: no tags are supported by all codics or file formats. look at the help of the Kodierer in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, obviously with the style of the selected CD; this is not important because we don't transmit the & CD; for more information, go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, can be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-editor will be back and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the requested data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply type the entries for the fields of the current denominations. give the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure you have entered the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from freeDB. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the denominations.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check sign before each line of a unit. only the titles are selected or out. make sure all the pieces are selected or select the button all pieces on the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection of read out of the read process, this window appears to confirmation. OK, click OK, and then we'll see a look at the window with the contracts, and pursue what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will you see if you are trying to work with a code that you haven't yet installed. pieces that were not successful are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have writing to the folder for temporary files and the target file?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear, why the error occurred right after the end of the start of the game.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. this can be read and encode parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program does not have the configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and encode. with a amd64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpreting and code (however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message appears in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioCreator; you need & KDE; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the coding of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (event events or text events). KMid automatically determines the procedure respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you & KDE; during the playing time of a song, KMid starts again with the same song again.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP drivers and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also get a file from a & Conqueror; window in the & cmid; window fall. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and push the button you play in the toolbar, select the entry play from the menu piece or enter the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece will automatically start when you pull it on the & kmid; -window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece is played, you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">When you find that a song is too fast or slow down, you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template. to get back the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space break or the select of the menu entry in the menu piece, thus interrupts the playback. betting the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Liedtexte can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set up which events are supposed to be displayed, and even better: the event type will automatically be selected, so you will automatically adjust the karaoke text. but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select from the menu settings the entries, or songwriters. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are the series to be played. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, you first open the collecting manager. find in the menu collection under the point.... click New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking the copy and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the thunder in the collecting manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When applying this collection, this collection will not be saved. if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the Collective Manager. there you can add a song with the button to add a song. it appears in turn the file dialog, with which help you choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the setting automation back to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece of opening (using file opening or drag & drop) will automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the opening pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to select the collecting manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series after the submenu of the menu collection, the songs are played in sequence, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove songs or random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collecting manager, or use the select list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">In order to jump back a song, select the button preceding piece, the previous piece from the menu piece or press the button arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collecting manager, select the delete collection and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be deleted. however, it doesn't matter since it is stored in leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map General MIDI events in occurrences that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you must edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that saves all the required changes for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. requirement for this is, however, that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... End Define KEYMAP "Another Keymap"... End Define CHANNELMAP... End options... End</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and End that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches from General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use will look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">For example, the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put on the sound with number M. if your keyboard is not supported (e.g. with sound 60) you can handle a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a thread. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">Therefore, if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (vault), patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the concept drum patch of the patch is meant with each tone a different perfusion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the clay means the pitch of the same drum (as many keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify as sounds on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As at PATCHMAP section the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map tones on the Perkye channel. look at the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to transfer some channels to other channels. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, make it simply in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is used on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, you will continue to use the Keymap with the name name for this channel. if you want to change the Forcepatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example, to always use the performant patch on the perkine channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio, in which proportion of Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied by the value of n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value is 4096, so that the Map file is not decimal (Decimal).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM exists that a keyboard that will play a pitch of sound with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some sounds to get two sounds up to a octave above. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & cmid; try around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of pips (one for every MIDI channel). on these pieces you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the canyon view to change the instrument on a certain channel. if you have modified an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played sounds. view in the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The Tempo LCD displays the speed, played with a song. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, you can find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played, it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. so it can result in the same MIDI file to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same score in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can force to force & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That can happen if you have a binary (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, it supports & kmid; drag & drop. open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror; choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, disable the setting automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow key left from Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & KDE; - Desktop a & Konqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; in this way I don't want to play a MIDI file or I want to play a file, merely go to the & Konqueror; -window, and draw the desired file into the window of & kmid; pull.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file, without having to add them straight to a collection, turn off the setting automation back to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. open from files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. not only want to play the first file. so you can adjust the setting automation for collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, I animates that, continue to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; in the moment I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maers; Laga. at the moment I'm not much free time for my Hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time. as Hobbies I collect program, MIDI files, make music and prove phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, error, or an idea for an extension of & kmid; do you or even if you simply want to make me happy, write to me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really wish to send me a postcard from your residence or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file, you will count with friends of & kmid; but if you want to contact a MIDI file, but if you want to contact me, as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my free time and I'm not worried about money. I would therefore agree that I only get closer programming, because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - correction of errors that the pitch was too high at AWE cards.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have any sound card, you must compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it runs as if you would have a sound card except that you cannot listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website on new releases, or send the question to The & KDE; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is displayed in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu. select individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category long playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy. if you prefer an entry, his group and all his subgroups to the current category will be copied and playback starts with the printed entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' Current piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do if & kmplayer / kmplayer /, can also be changed through an editor, but also through the application itself. through the click of a subgroup, only the XML content will display this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must choose from the menu with playlist and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if editing mode or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Following the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can only be switched through the change of XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation will be deactivated by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 'option on' 1 '. if the option is not present, it can simply be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format needs to be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation on stables doesn't need to be short, it will be terminated automatically by opening a different source. this would be disturbing at the end-animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; IMG dur = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif. / lt; & lt; / bodyworks; In the directory tests / some examples of SMIL which are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the disk space from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here's the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example of a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & mmplayer; it can even be played by the special field Embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">With that the & kmplayer; 'flash' can use HTML pages to use the & mplayer; module as service providers for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & mplayer; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there is no mistakes, the backend output is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always a given backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if this is determined), it must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should use all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be configured, the scanner can be configured to use the configuration dialog, or the TV channels can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the kmplayer is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port. there should be detected ports (e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support can be used by kmplayer only XVideo (probably this type of playing video equipment under Linux is the only works). this is why the videoforlinux server must be working on the X server. therefore, this is why the XFree86 server must therefore contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, by KMPlayer for the sources used various names. at the time of the emergence of this documentation this dvdnavresource, dvdsource, eclipsource, tvscanner, tvsource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they start with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there indications how I can make my CDROM drive quieter if I play from it (not of the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is as user root according to the device. it's essential to ensure that / dev / cdrom shows the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is used to work with multiple files. with a master document the work is simplified using other integrated .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if there are no mistakes in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File information: in this mode, the DVI; file is based on the subject of nature, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Considering the editing tool bar, the three large-scale selection fields should be developed. the first selection box has been developed for the quick installation of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The veritable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Other is for entries of articles such as keywords, notes, notes, or references.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name is created for a section, a picture or different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Regarding: is used for reference to a fixed name (selection for a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is indicated. for the processing of & BibTex; files are corresponding editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & b. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¼ Ã © is used for the creation of the font. it can be written for the main text to be defined as notes of notes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1775">In the call of & kile; two selection options are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document through selection of document and consolidation of the settings. 2. the document may be written by the reason.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the instruction\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font color. if the font is not specified, it can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the source code has been entered, the & latex has to be compiled. the simplest way to this is the use of the menu building or the button.</seg>

<seg id="1781">The details are given only within the environment (from\\) {n} to\\ end}. there is no protection (number) for details within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many people to provide reading and usability of the document. for example, there are certain fonts, fat pressure, capping pressure, submissions, etc. these commands are either connected with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ '{Premature Ejaculation}: this command is for the spa pressure, and is long as long until he is closed with a\\ end {stamped} or another environment. a single word in a proposition can be represented with\\ emph {word} cursive.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ '{Quote} and ends with\\ end {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex code; it is now displayed a step-for-step instructions for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in an assistant, a bit text has been entered, a few adjustments should be completed for better readability of the document. to this, at least one quote, some places in the fat and capping pressure and a poem is used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">As soon as the document has been viewed, editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (internal viewer). an external viewer needs to be closed with an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & postscript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a framed file format (English. D e V ice I nate). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi edition such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). in the 7th step - by clicking on DVI - can then print the document using a file (if the printer is properly set).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & latex; source code is created, the conversion can start in a different formats using the top PFE in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-presentation look at the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. to this end, only modern can set up modern under settings...</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to search for the preliminary search, the mouse indicator has to be positioned in a line of the source-texts and connect to pre-search-search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then done then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the medium mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document & cile; in & eyepiece; in & eyepiece; as text editor should be specified as text editor (setup eyepiece... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should the use of fast construction of the & DVI; viewer can not be used, an error occurred. should there be a mistake, this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file extension refers to error source in the source code. in the editor, the recording file will always be used in the error. in order to consider the faultful line, the error must be clicked on the error in the logged line, navigating immediately to the flawed line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as the corresponding button in the tool bar is clicked, a window is to choose from a selection of the document for the document. the default values are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty document, a document may be used either by reason or the wizard to create a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">User-tier users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate creating a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new presentation, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file extension or a new file must be created. & cile; can create a new template using existing document and selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using a file new, some strings can be replaced by other data (e.g. name or drawing codes). these variables may be set in settings of Kile... settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating its own presentation, it is therefore necessary to know which characters can be replaced by the variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically they will be used:\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and that in the editor's instructions. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">The creation of a new document can then be the own template instead of the standard material.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. a simple way to create a template should be searched after one on the Internet and can be drilled under the steps below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and highlighting of many different kinds of text files (including also & latex; and & BibTex;). many settings can be made directly from & kile; can be made out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his mom would like to learn the manual to Kate. users of & kile; can be found directly with reading the chapter of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called for the menu help LaTeX reference. you can find a balance of all commands that can be found in & latex; use it as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with folded Strg button to balance the & tex; meaning that in this way, click\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with penetrated linker mouse, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with penetrated switching key, the source of the source code in the Editorwindow will be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to browse the wide variety of sources of sources and emphasized this. for example, the & latex commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants are identical to sprint stamps. this is a type of bookmarks within the text. this is also highlighted the jump stamp or the corresponding key brand, so that it will be automatically logged in the first input of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The Edit is probably one of the main component in using a program such as & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent MÃ ¶ gages have been added in & kile; important functions for the writing of a & latex; special commands for their selection. under processing equipment, the following commands are included in the text-selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">If you have a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line), this extended meaning does not include tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventive thing in & kile; this means that the figures are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">If the word is under the current curry position. this selection also has a enlarged meaning, since this command also has a latex (\\) and a positive star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For steering a part of the document, this first can be removed and by pressing the button. & Kate; offers the keeple Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; provides with its commands for faster data. under processing, the following commands are included:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description on processing equipment.</seg>

<seg id="1822">With this command, at the beginning of the current environment (no matter where current position is), the cursor is placed directly before the command to the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, at the end of the current environment (no matter where current position is), the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">When the cursor is found or within the command\\ in the {surroundings}, the end of the environment is sprayed (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the input of many shined ambient commands, the environment can be lost quickly. this command does not close the last setting, so that the telegraph environment will not be broken.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under the TeX-Group there are some important commands that comply with the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, at the beginning of the current group (no matter where current position is), the cursor is placed directly in front of the slipping clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, at the end of the current group (no matter where current position is), the cursor is placed directly behind the closing clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the weakening clamp of a & tex; group # is, is sprayed at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many screwed groups brackets can be lost fast to the most important groups. this command does not close the last group, so that the shook structure of the & tex will not be broken.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple beginner signs are used in & kile; the sign "for two simple trials is used. also for the end of the beginnings, the sign is used. & Kile; knows this case and for two closing arguments for r & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic adjustment of the double vacations can be set under settings Kile... LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It also applies to specific settings (e.g. née or French), so that German or French beginnings are used. there are also many other languages.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already there is a good source code for us, this in & kile has been added; for special commands (mostly for & latex;) are still extended. all these modes are equipped for the automatic adjustment. all of these modes are used for the automatic adjustment of settings. all these modes are set to be set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">In the beginning a new environment through the command\\ release {surroundings} is & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surroundings} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When drying the RÃ ¼ r, the last letter of entry is removed and can be confused as a result list. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are subject to selecting a command. alternatively, a simple jump to these positions is open, so that a simple jump to these positions is open, and the corresponding parameters can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Inter alia cile; cile... cile; adherence settings to these lists can be made. there are different colors lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as alarm from the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not valid for the completion of environments. it can always be entered a few characters with\\. in the other hand, environments will be a large list of environmental commands to result in. on the other hand, environments will be used so often that & kile; a special mode for completion of environments.</seg>

<seg id="1968">Plugins are able to be managed by plugins. plugins are KPart applications of the third side, which can be used by any KPart application, on the best-known & Konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in must be the following:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not on the standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is handed over to the plug-in at the start, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of current file) or the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "Only-Lese" mode: check if the plugin refuses to store the store. only check-in parts usually refuse to store when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the Plugin: is this activated, then testet & quantaplus; if the adjusted information is correct. disable the saving of the application is then not available if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the error search was completely redeveloped. no support for the dbg Debugger. instead of it a debugger Plugin has been implemented, which enables various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debuggers for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plugins in the project settings. with the button options next to the debugger plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that is displayed in the contents of guarded variables. usually, in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">One view, where all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed, usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that is shown in the output (like in HTML) of the Debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debuggers, everything is or part of the following functionality available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to debugger is necessary, if necessary, or it shares the plug-in to listen to Debugans. this action will be triggered by default when a project will not be used, so in the normal case does not have to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen session Start the session. closes the connection to debugger or ends the leaves to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server for a debug request. this is synonymous with using a browser window to view the current document. the output of this requirement is shown in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points out the debugger to begin with the execution of the script and the currently performed line continuously. if this happens when the script is done, the execution will continue. happens, before a debit claim has started, the script will start with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points the debugger to start with the version of the script, without information to oversaw variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is done, the execution goes on. is the execution as soon as a requirement is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Debugger performs the next statement in the script, without going into the functions or includes:</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next statement in the script, although possible in functions and includes incorrect adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points out the debugger to pass the directive and go to the next way, as if it did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitoring value appears in the variation view.</seg>

<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be done manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see in details for transformation.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Featuresdialoges, the & quantaprc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insert of tags to a document without risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are not as folder. they only contain the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. day-folders bear the name of the indescriptioning language and version, so there is. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declared whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible to make other users a better view and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations are placed in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only contain once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains as a only element type about himself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script feature. when using it & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day-type class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for Type Method. returns the name of the class, where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tags. this item can only happen once for each attribute. additionally, it sets the name and type of attribute. additionally, it contains more tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source codes used for the attributes in the tag Editordialog and attribute-tree in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. dcop interface is used within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of a interface. dcop methodological name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, one interface and methodology name. the arguments that will be handed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag which grouped the elements of a list together. it can only happen for an attribute description. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the attribute of a tags inside a dialog. this day can only happen for each attribute in a dialogue (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Gives the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for each field in dialogue (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the definable Tags. this item is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this item is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files need to begin with a & XML; Declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but watch out & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; whatsthis &gt;, and some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML files, the tools dialog above in & quantaplus; -window to start and check out TagXML. to select another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. at present, check only occurs during the loading of the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the file name for this TagXML file is supposed to be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; loading function is described. the filename of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; day name = "overload" type = "function" returnkey = "character" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / day &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via DTD edit DTD settings; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD indication; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can define action with settings... created. Click on New Action to the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned shortcut key. with clicking the user defined user interface, a key abbreviation can be assigned; with Kone, the current keepers can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detaigated settings and inserted this text in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or as input (or parts of document). even examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start-up dialogue or the different see... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are permitted, it is recommended to use the% script.sh. in this way: global scripting folders: $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the current document. in case of a local document, file size: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; process. if from & quantaplus; only one instance is taken, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters of this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods mentioned above, a script input of & quantaplus can be used on the default entry. in the radio box input, what are the default to be sent. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected field of document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually sensible with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">Accordingly, the output of the application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, on the default output. it can be stated that the default output is to be specified by the default edition:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in this case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you must add actions and configure. select Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes and you are planning to enable you to edit your dialogue "Day" when available, so that input will be possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igouitt! is that a bad symbol. who should remember the action with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & menu;, graphics Other programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& Kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that day start, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as an example), or should be signalized, or at least, a message to the user will indicate that clicking this symbol is a & lt; it starts in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with Settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the required action. besides the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder, in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and put it on with other tags, so there is, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions for tool bar or it should set this for a better overview through some Trenders into several groups. make the toolbar set up dialog via Settings tool bar. make sure the toolbar is chosen.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenner (top left) for my tool bar. after choosing the element, which should be added to the tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the queror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner support the grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the & Conqueror; button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by propositions of all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored in the right file, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc, so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language that you like best. this is why I describes this chapter as I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository whether any one has done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc / language. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second, we treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example, php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Sections Section 2 = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.1 Sections 2 = Day 2, Day 2 = day 2, tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the document tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation:</seg>

<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess bar code (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents can be referenced directly to one file (and clearly stated at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but watch out & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateien.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section of the section is the area of docrc file, which is intended to display the context of context & PHP; for example, if the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function will be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file binding.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc / share / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR / share / apps or $KDEDIR /</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this is good and value is to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, such as documentation were not rich in the & quantaplus; community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; are you not alone. it is possible to share the resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or otherwise to whom are sent. at different places there is an email with email, toolbar toolbar with email, toolbar menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts in the script and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download it. to sign a useful contribution, we recommend to sign the resources to sign up for a GPG / PGP key. this means that the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked after their Passphrase for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase will not be saved), or in the case you can search for a new resource (URL-preview can remain empty), and click OK to upload the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the upload toolbars from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload toolbars, and will begin in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installation, examines & quantaplus; in the case of problems, it may be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work with XML-languages which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; it can be time to work by adding a DTEP package because hundreds of day files can be needed in the day XML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD load and converge of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective name: newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep file.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition line: the string that is in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd will be released</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP according to conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; according to converting the & descriptionrc, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these fundamental concepts we have to do with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantitative; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projects. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantaphlus; it is possible that the group of administrators are stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators different workstations, actions and patterns in a global tree that can be available to each in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tool bars. local elements are stored in user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; -pattern up to toolbar with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are filed under the folder's folder and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the building sites, the cartographers with information and the toolbars. please suggest in, and for further information regarding these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">One can click the box with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current documentation, such as close the current, other or all cartists, reloading, deleting or upload of document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click on the Editors' link to a further context menu related to the processed document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), processing under the mouse pointer or open the file, if the string is described under the mouse pointer a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor there are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars will be adapted to the new functions and thus linked users needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to include a simple day, e.g. & lt; embark; in their document, then click the icon which has to include the date. if you want to insert the data for this just one day, you can insert several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog box of various fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction prospects (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and pass through. in the presentation with cartographers are available for files, project, pattern of documentation, documentation, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using right mouse click. actions such as add, removing, upload or delete files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities to be open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what connection it is used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project is also working here. through clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button you can select other functions, such as the script, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one displays the internal structure of the active document. through left-click of an element, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. by the right-click of an element, a list of instructions in terms of navigation and handling of the tree is open.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other areas of construction. with it, some attributes and namespaces may change. the modification of all available attributes with a few clicks is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the full documentation for Web technology for your development. it can be downloaded for & quantitative documentation; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be downloaded, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cartists at the bottom of the window, can be achieved via the usable information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cartography shows information about each in Quanta running script. so, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are indicated.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed will give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility of defining their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive about & email; if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can secure this in & quantaplus; like any other backup and charging!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the site of the & quantaplus files on your system. in order to get a complete list of options that can be handed to the configure script. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at stake of & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH is on the same folder. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During an effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers started to deal with an obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup languages? well, this would make him absolutely great for Web development tools for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Not longer to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarize: if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantitative; for it should be suitable & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaphlus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why development, which already has someone else developed? thanks to the & KDE; rumor is not only this everything possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; as to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can expand productivity dramatically. through self-painted actions, scripts and toolbars, automating almost every task is possible. through this program, they can expand & quantaplus, without any scripting language language tax. (more about it can be found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detailed documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter or helpcenter help: / quanta execute).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developing and cared for by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list is changing every time you can open a file, which is not on it, whereby the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for the later use. if you try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project presentation folder, only an error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Convert to insert from the clipboard there are special signs for the & HTML; enrollment, so they are correct and not be understood from the browser as a formatting assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -enshrase, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in the URL; s. first line to add & URL; s is used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches block selection respectively. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are chosen!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed using GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the news window and not. this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">The problem and enrollment of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; Hauptfensters. the problem reporter is activated once you are changing to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbol-old left from the main window. this column allows you to set up with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with entries prior or next, depending on the position of the cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu, grouped after the file names of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects will be saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presented a dialog to insert files into the current project. selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches for the project directory after new files that could be there. this allows you to copy graphics files into your project file or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Downloads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find detailed information.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Charges a project tool. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only stored in this menu when you assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new factory toolbar. this creates only the names. actions need to store the toolbar via toolbars, or you will be asked when ordering, if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the viewing area. if you don't delete the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, that the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu option opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the uploading of toolbars on the main server where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; you or someone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / auffeur of the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities should be cracked out without the whole & DTEP; if this is not present and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the store will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day installation dialog if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific undermending.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivates the intelligent insert of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quantaplus; insert the insert using tool bar, if this day is contradict the rules this day.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plug-ins listed under the menu listed below are listed. Click to click on a activated plugins.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the Syntaxies mode for the current file. the list of available measures are based on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate changeover between different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, the changeover time might need time or unnice graphics. recommended is the card size, which is also the default mode, or the lower window mode, which corresponds to the presentation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open window window. with selection of a insert the corresponding window is enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main character.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialogue apply every application that use the KHTML Part, including the & Konqueror; -web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judge the behaviour of the Editorderer. in the documentation of & Kate; you will find detailed details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or adding which you can change.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should be a help according to the setting of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but like with each open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled up at the top of the project, as for example, after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later with Shift; F7 Project Properties Tab.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name file, file will be automatically filled out.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces using the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine that one wants to access, one, apart from local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, default settings are used. depending on the remote computer, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder, in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder, in which the toolbars for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows files to include files from the local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or whole folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static webinder you want to download and change. in serverpage scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Defending, if files, which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are supposed to be integrated. if a project is started to restart, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make an exact selection of dilution.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by anchors or, by removing the bunch, out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be upload in the menu with project Properties in the lower window profiles or with the key Shift Shift; F7 changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder possible), which will be revamped with project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, even files listed in .cvsignals are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded during opening the project. can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the button options. in case the error search is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the lower window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the indication of a construction view of the server for each profile, forming a own building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the lower window configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details in details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration, you can switch event promotions and add these actions to change or delete these actions. event actions will be executed when a certain event happens, such as the sickle of a file. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior is currently not influence.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select the project... from the menu project or the symbol Project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus is closed, the project file will be stored automatically. you will be asked whether you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you upload a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project management reports are free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">As well, however, the entries are missing and opening up with... in the right mouse button menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here, different profiles can be searched here. the profile contains information about the site of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is blinded to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will retain in the core memory and if the program is forgotten. this possibility is useful when the frequency of upload files is necessary and the rather unsafe password will not save in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialogue if you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-load profiles can be uploaded to the project (or parts of the project) to various servers. in editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name to be copied onto the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves from. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually, this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator runs a service not to the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attack wave, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it according to your discretion, so it can't be read on the plate, so it can't be easily read, but everyone with programming results can be seen easily in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tool toolbars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simply divers of view, can be loaded several files and toolbars, and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored or delete on the toolbar project, or the project toolbar via the toolbar project tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only boost productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to the own workwise.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best above the menu tool bar. use and adding differ. adding tool bars will be treated at the bottom of the tool below.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), which can be done with new action, a new tool bar, or toolbar can be done, which can be specified in the dialog, where actions on this or other toolbar should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (icon) on a tool bar, additionally remove the entries from action and action worked, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with toolbars... and setting settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essential documentation, code snips and files to link. you can copy, move or link any existing directory with extended organisation and interfaces. templates are in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you need for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions before each template provided precisely due to the use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binve is everything that is not purer text. it can be inserted every file except text, images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted in the storage space below global templates. further information about the templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually you will be a simple report for the purpose and organises work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples can be found in the storage area under global templates. see also for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always added to the documents. you can find everything from a comment via a final menu on Javascript or Perl. some examples are in the storage area under global templates. see also for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are available for all websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a file structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and save file as a template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it is done, notice that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check in the storage area under project areas.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click the file as a template as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and placing on the build-view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be used in a pre-level file. all file management functions can be used, such as pulling and insert or insert via the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">One can click on a folder or in the project files build on a folder to the right and secure Site template, secure a name for the presentation and secure. by default, it is secured as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project objectives enable a very target-oriented approach. you can attach headlines and footer lines or dynamically with & PHP; in addition, you can insert or link with them. in addition, one can keep some things in use of templates in projects very profound in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the lower window templates are based on the files specified in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates and templates. each of this folder is equivalent to one of four types of containers, as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to specify the behavior of a folder in the foreword table with the right mouse button to click on the folder and in the context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A radio box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is hidden, as soon as the attributes is inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except for regular folders. if a regular folder would disable it, unless they were explicitly explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the Blah would appear with something like Text Baustein. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows charging or presented text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footer lines for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into one folder with special headphones and footer lines a whole presentation already with the appropriate headlines / footer lines.</seg>

<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second informs the editor window in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor is as follows: it downloads a document like a normal & HTML; - page and cursor appears. then you can edit and edit the source code as required in the VPL code editor, which are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing & PHP; there is no plans to change these behaviours.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that simultaneously the changes are visible in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronous, this mode is already active, the key pressure of the active cursor from a window to others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. additionally you can automatically choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation can be set automatically. in general, the recommendation can be adjusted for quick calculator and a large spot for slow PC.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the processing of invisible tags in work with the VPL; editor is also called, as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is also called. this is what a new document with the VPL; this means you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. stroke words for internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows the change of the inhalf, e.g. keywords in the column names and keyword key words on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change about the list is possible just as with the meta-elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to attach an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is as in a word Processing, is possible by clicking with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor is behaved as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing and using a backdrop or ranch.</seg>
<seg id="2225">In the same way, the insertion of tags is made in the same way, as in the source editor, that the insert of tags should not be removed before existing identical tags, e.g. if an anchor tag, must be inserted with text, any other converted anchor tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars as the tables assistant or the lists wizard are deactivated. they will work later in & VPL; for this release the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes made and at the same time the insertion had changed. another programmers had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2283">That of me used the program only showed me the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly had changed within this line. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps the changes had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could have differences in line and changes to white characters. later, any amount of further useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you would like to compare text quickly, copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparisons window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merging folders. this function transformed & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported, this is useful if two people are able to work independently from one piece of body and changes. the original file (the base) helps to process the resolution of conflicts. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screen photo shows three quell files when merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you complete with the same and merging full folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in file combination:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and respect the possibilities of current colour monitors. if you need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no anger, if Jn changes the impression.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can simplify the typing work by simply writing the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 / O Zielordner kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening-dialog allows the manual type of filenames, the selection about the file browser (file...) or selecting a last modified file. you don't have to specify a third file, if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences in two files will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button files... you can also select a folder. if you select a file, the comparing or merging of folders will be used, but for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active and process. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file. you can also do this step later to the store.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The button-button opens a dialog with settings. here you can define options before you start with the comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text box. compare, text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in open dialogue you do not need to select files, you can simply connect the dialogue with the break-knob.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and insert: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains some similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar to these features, this would be a relatively large amount of effort. you would need to download and compare it into & kdiff3; now you can simply copy and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment you can go out & kdiff3; pull out. only the failure of text is supported in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and remove text in another program as learting and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such a case, your original data may be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box is the Info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every Info line has a little color. (if the path is too long, let the mouse will rest a while on line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are assigned the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color that file differs. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merging) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links to the text is the interaction column. if differences were found, the column displays the appropriate color. if white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the processor and in a few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column of the text, is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is displayed in broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparisons) also has a Info line with the inscription:, the file name and [Gechanges] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!!! until all conflicts are disbanded, the Save is disabled!!! (use the buttons to be dissolved and disrupting the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, each monitor must be solved simultaneously a conflict that must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows, the first line of the group is highlighted in all windows, and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also be a jump to the current group.) This group will then be the current group. it will be emphasized with the color background colour for current area and the left appears to be a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or by manual processing, no further line is left in the group; this text is only a placeholder for the case that you may change your opinion, and perhaps again another source. this text appears either in the final stored file, nor in a marker you might need to copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; assembling conjunctions; however, appear in the clipboard when you copy such text from the window window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources you ignore the numbers, or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly to the keyboard and the mouse, but you can use the arrow keys to the left, right, up, down, page on, page, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Strg end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. clicking on the vertical image bar can also be used by clicking on the navigation system.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the insert button, you can switch between insertion and overdrive mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click of the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns synchronizes the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group (as already discussed in section merging and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar includes seven buttons on navigation with the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-top), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture descending / Ctrl-picture downstream) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, it must also be regarded as a conflict. therefore, it must be distinguished between soldered and unrimal conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in the clipboard, you need to automatically copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Strg insertion). if this is enabled, whatever you select, automatically copied into the clipboard and copy the manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally write the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilers are stored in accordance with the basic operating system. UNIX-based systems use a line-in feed\, and Win32-based systems use a car-driven\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the line of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and reproduced at the next start. (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also sets the fonts with variable width, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in italic writing are displayed. if the chosen font is not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in its pure form but would be smoked. on these systems, the button settings automatically represents an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the tab of the tabulator button inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you enter or press return, the incoming line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be copied automatically into the clipboard. manual copy into the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which Zeiling-type you prefer to store. the default value is the usual choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When attempting to files & kdiff3; first, all complete identical lines can be ignored in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step white characters will not be ignored. in this step white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car-driven '\' at the end of a line, other again store only one line-feed '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the car sign are visible, but then, like a white character, this option must be deactivated. in default, this option must be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignores. in the results, the differences are still displayed, but they will be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. this option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic transmitting mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unrest conflict is going.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solve automatic all conflicts in white characters by the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you are considering that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to scanning the folders and execute a merging. look for details under documentation to the directory comparing and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, then the original version is the Suffix .original file, if already a such backupfile with the Suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. this option does not affect the current program. you need & kdiff3; end and restart, so the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted for each entry separately. if you activate this option, all entries are used for the upper setup.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Via the selection fields for the coding, a short notice that is the local coding. (this can't be changed here and has an informal character here.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences such as special characters treated and interpret. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can define which coding should be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (e.g., your files can handle 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress down changes in white characters in text or comments (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options are ignored or Ignatiere C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may only see the differences between two of three files. depending on the selection of A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt;</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. check out the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparisons to each other or to each other. this can also be useful for display of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide if you compare the files together in merge menu. (if this function is used to restart merging and use the file names of the last source file as default for the output file. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be given first to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function for example, for removing disturbing parts or to correct the insert.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will be given first to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command was given (see above), then the output of the command is used only at the line-off. you may have to write your own processor. any input line must have an associated edition line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind is to facilitate the user more flexibility while setting up diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>

<seg id="2354">While you experiment with used, you might be able to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions. you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for Zeilenabasca / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a showing, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several changes to once. then you can use the Semicolon ';' to separate the requirements of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used, you can also use some other different details such as perl. perl -p -E's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allergy are different from perl some details. where used\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after normal pre-processor are maintained for viewing and interaction. the further operations are changing only the data that the line-down algorythmus sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-right processor is the issue of the normal pre-processor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but, as in any function, the text changes or differences, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a file. for this reason, you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folder readily compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... for each object a proposal to merge; you can adapt the suggestion before start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can the merge simulate and shows the simulated changes, without it really performing,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparing and merge of individual files. you only need to open folder on command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as basis. if no target folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merge. to select the merge, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During reading the folder you will inform you a small news window over the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scan is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any file that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The file structure will usually be folded together. you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrows keys to the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions of all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, the file comparison is started and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window on the selected object. in such a case, the combination hr action will not be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about the problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As in the above picture shows are used in columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, the color is identical with identical entries, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if you are identical to all content. then file the same color. with folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea on this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A exists, deleting the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A folder and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if A folder and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronize mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder, and if the option synchronize directories. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if needed for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; directly after merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merging (unsecure), then examines & kdiff3; the date of files are different, but the date is identical, but the date is identical.. Solange cannot be eliminated such mistakes can not be started using the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file is working after the others. status column indicates that when merging was successful, and according to other messages when the merge is complete, you should make a last review and see whether the status is OK.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When setting up the comparative analysis of full analysis, KDiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unmonasteries, soldered, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three files are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can select either the selected entry (file or ocdner), or all entries at once. if you selected all merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a target folder, then it is used in the three-file meeting mode C as the goal, in the two-folder combination, A and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a target folder, please check whether all entries should be displayed in the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options in particular entries to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key abbreviation). to bring only the current record: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to conflicting data types, still invalid merge actions exist, a message appears on the faults elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you assemble all entries, a dialog window appears with the options, simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen if you really want to make the really changes. you will then receive an exhaustive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then runs certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (lead to a single file), then a merge window (see the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select once again directories / continue or press F7. if you still do not have saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then it runs & kdiff3; continue his work with the next post.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some errors that will help you to test the cause of the problem, or make the problem to solve a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other way before you continue with merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually assembled individually, this records (in the current session) and leads them together in later, these entries will not be saved, or not saved, these entries will be dealt with. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit onto the specified pattern are displayed in the elemental pattern. you can separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folder must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element-tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element-tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that will be ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this file can be set-specific with a .cvsignals file. (see below info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a directory attribute. in other file systems a printed point. a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the element-tree or not. this option is switched on default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to the links. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is switched off, the links like normal folder will be treated and recursively searches. (note that & kdiff3) will not pass on possible records. a link to itself would lead to an end loop and crashes (crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics of statistics. (the number of deleted, unmonasteries, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower if it is applied to files containing no text. (type an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders across a slow network, it may be faster, only the change date and the file size is to compare. this speed advantage is however a certain degree of security. please be careful with caution. this option is discharged in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of date. there is no real comparison to date. these files are considered identical if they are equal. that can be useful if copying the date of change. please be careful with caution. this option is discharged in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronize mode when two folders are compared and not a target folder. in this mode the suggestions for merging files are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the copy of the newer file as action. (this is considered unsafe, because the other file has not changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a file is replaced or delete, then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .original if an old Backup file is deleted with the .original extension already exists, so it will also be deleted without any backup. this option does not only merge full folder. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder coaches remains visible to the merge single files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the window in the window menu, you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file via double-click. however, there is also a single file directly into the merge menu. as soon as you save the file, the status is stored and the file will not run once again if you launch the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status goes out however if you read the directory again: directory-menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO-Slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can open files and folders that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local file.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax than local files and folders. a few things should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a brief list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or can't be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder. then, it will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit authorizations or change of change. therefore, the permissions or change of change from the original. (please note the option of confidentiality of size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently being the differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop first starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a KPart, the patch file consists of the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. also this is unreliable if the original files has changed since generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the comparisons of folders will not support in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is compromised) already. also the name KDiff3 indicates that it can merge like the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot as I looked into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers that went on or go there so much.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have previously compiled the program from sources and configure the configure PREFIX in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more detailed information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters varies, these lines are treated as identical as identical, but if only a non-white character is treated, the line will not be treated as not identical. iF similar lines of next to Each other, this subject, but this is the case of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is simply lost if the result is simply stored as text file, and it is too much effort to design an extra file format which could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort to have been so far too large. you can always reproduce a specific version of using a source A / B / C. in order to process larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text suddenly lt; no src lint; appeared and the text can't delete it. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors to draw from differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information, how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE, you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the latest modifications at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; to compile and install, use the command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system installed in the KDE. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake should not have any problems with compile. if difficulties persist, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or umber-insert) add the text from the clipboard on the current curry position and replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are shown: files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder's structure, and therefore do not appear in the target file.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to read the folders with the function updates.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to display the differences. if the target file does not contain these files, they are missing after merge. (the behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with labelling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed from the button to the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. undertakes in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual work areas. it is quite convenient to revise the ongoing programs on the working areas, to finish their size, stop it or move it. this works both inside a desktop as well as in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can all virtual working areas as well as displaying the current applications. applications can be selected and even move on desktop and other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the medium mouse button, windows can be moved within & pager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only appear only the two entries in Pager. however, the context and the name of the application as well as the names of the application as well as the entries, maximize, on Desktop and Finish. the following commands have the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only when clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to selected virtual desktop. appears only if it was clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved within the & pager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also be moved to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, are displayed in the & pager; the name of the virtual work areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Crossing this field allows the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual work areas. together with its name, the names are equipped with ordinances, & eg; 1. mind.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background every desktop is also displayed as a background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, running programs will be displayed as small windows in & pager; otherwise only empty workspaces are displayed in order to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple rectangles with the program window. icon displays the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program icon. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -Hauptfensters will be determined: in a 2xn-grid, how from Pager applications appear in some other Windows applications; horizontally, all virtual work surfaces are in a horizontal row, which is very good for the representation at the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, the windows as icons or with their content. furthermore, it runs out of the control panel.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & pager; and subsequent retrieving the switch... leaves the dialog settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this can not be changed in the dialog settings. but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you'll need to register as user root or register to your system administrator. in this file you need to enter the keys windowTransparent mode and assign this a value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can you handle the pain that arises during the mouse to cause pain. unfortunately, you can cause pain that are related to your computer with the use of your computer, you should look for a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it even clearer: even if & kmousetool should avoid pain that arise when clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain that applies through the mouse because of the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be diminished for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click immediately after breaking the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart splash is enabled, making & kmousetool; a break, after releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can run the pulling on a pressing mouse button. the smart splash requires a little practice, but you get used quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can reduce & KDE; to add the reaction time, go to sound & multimedia, select sound system and here the horsemen. there is a shift sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & KDE; this feature is currently only below & KDE; available at GNOME or other windowments, please enter the respective documentation to find out how you start a program automatically.</seg>

<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & KDE; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or spots in browserwindow, which do not represent a link, you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is buck, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the pages of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and dirt can scratch easily with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started using this case. if you're in this case, it means that & kmousetool means that the operation can't stop by letting the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click. this is reset by the status of & kmousetool; back and you can continue as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to make it. however, you can't manage the mouse on a neutral field of desktop. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart camera but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it and again add any other action to move it into the clipboard, but it will probably cause problems with them. here are some advice for this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent shifting if you just start using & kmousetool to use. mark text instead like this: perform a mouse click on the other end of the text area, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is always played every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button lets you play a sound like a mouse click. later you can use the intelligent drive without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it must be installed on most system already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers that are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; actuated the mouse button soon as soon as the mouse pointer shortly. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome, and to those who have prepared pain.</seg>

<seg id="2622">In order to understand the work of filters, it is important to know how the program "tool dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differs in four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readern has the highest priority. it is predrawn to all the orders and holds these orders. if the edition of the screen reader is pre-read, orders received will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news like & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has precedence and maintains the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the news. while you & eg; you can welcome a long text on a website. & KDE; notifications are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every assignment you encounter with the map orders, is a text contract. KSayit is an example of applications that have text applications. text orders are intended for the issue longer texts that have no special pressures.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order species are shipped in queue-long, except for the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen Readers, while & ktts; just such a reading, this issue is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readern. they will be applied to normal warnings, messages, and text orders, as well as on & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and give it to the next filters. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Characters can replace parts of a text by other text. the replaceable parts can be delivered either as words or regular expressions, which allow the replacing of chat-emotions as: -) by text or for the conversion of news from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to transform & ktts, some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML included.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With Spreaders you can send orders depending on the text of the text or depending on the program that send the text to & ktts; for example, if you have hired a female voice, you can read the text of KDE messages about it. Siehe. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters is adjustable, after which it is applied for a language output. if the filter is fixed, its rules does not apply, he continues the text unchanged at the next filters.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text contract, a message, warning or a & KDE; message to & ktts; it is processed by all activated filters, which were set up on the page below. editing will take place in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the furnished normal filters. if a filter is not crossed, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filer, and it will be shown below the following setting dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the installation of string filters, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions than comparative pattern. if this pattern is found in the text, then the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text. large and small page will not be considered when comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filters. you can choose any name, it must be different from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the string in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The program "Social-dispatcher" uses a adaptable module architecture for language synthesizers. if you wish to expand & ktts; for use of another synthesizers, you will be able to contact the Developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; it is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile it, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "meaning-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source texts of & ktts; from the source archive for kdees, or download any night currently created tarball, translating and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you can use & ktts, check first if your language dispatcher works correctly with your language synthesizers. in addition, you can use the Shellskript SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & KDE; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts. the program tmsgr is to be developed so that the setup of speech dispatcher is directly possible and the script SPD-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into single sentences. the user can reset, repeat, repeat the output or break down.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application is based on & ktts, for example, it can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have a speaker created, whose language is English and whose sex is female, this is automatically the best speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktts, you will be chosen to see you in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the map speaker on adding, click here to insert a speaker in the list or click on Edit, the card speaker system is shown below. as an example, the module for the Festival Interactive is shown below. details on the modules can be found.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path is to Festival in PATH, you only need to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to festival. in general, this attitude will automatically be performed automatically. generally, Western languages are used to use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or slovakian use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you will adjust volume, microphone speed and pitch of synthetic language. if you cannot select some controllers, and this gray can be displayed, which will not be selected from you.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as multiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded with their size. if you are loaded this check box, these voices will already be loaded with the start of KTTSD, so that the first set is synthesized by the first set faster.</seg>

<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readern has the highest priority. it will be moved to all the orders and holds these orders. after the edition of the Screen-Reader was pre-read, orders received received again.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have priority priority. this stage is important news like & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output from messages and normal text. these orders will continue after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can welcome to & kmouth; nevertheless someone welcome you ride the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text message is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a Screen Readers, adds & ktts; the audio output in the queue is long.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound are active as well as the introductory message, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders. for news, warnings and issues of screen reels there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the standard voice, the festival is used for the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch will not be set at the festival configuration dialog, the SSML text is usually very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and satin-cross recognition filters (SDB filters). this can also be synthesized as only the first phrase, as only the first phrase must be synthesized, not to jump or cancel, even when the language synthesizers are not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts; it is set up automatically as a set of a set of satin identifiers. you can add the settings or add further Satzunlimited recognition filters.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Easiest to simplify the device selection, select the speaker selection, and select text to read, change the speaker selection, and select some features and check how the speaker selection has changed. of course, you have to have set up more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start with the pre-reading, as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You may then apply text orders on the map orders, even if the language synthesizers are not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal movement detection filter is automatically created when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, just removed. change nothing to this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">With a regular expression of punctuation, compare text with a regular expression of punctuation and add a tabulatorsign (Decimal characters 8) to the satin limits (tab automatically from the text is automatically removed from the filter). note that the standard movement detection filter keeps the character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & KDE; -News (adhesive), warnings, messages, or the output of screen rears.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal movement detection filter, you can insert this again by inviting the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card speaker selection, you can skip the application settings for the application. the card card is displayed, if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the chief on the map speaker). in other words, there are no speaker characteristics.</seg>

<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired speaker. if this feature doesn't matter, you don't give it any.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box when the property has to have before other features. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output is, it will always be used as the main feature. the only case if you possibly want to specify the attribute language, lies before, if you know that a specific application sends text in another language as that in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the area speaker, which is the most listed below, click on the selection button and then use speaker, which is the most listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input is 0 necessary).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I do not get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and finished; the GST-register-0.8 is finished. if the problem is not solved, you may not install a compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall Gstreamer.</seg>

<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts can occur at ALSA that prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. evidence of possible solutions will be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have an additional voice for the festival of the Internet. I installed them and can use it in the festival but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the map audio, there is a rate of speed. so this works, the SOX program has to be installed and over the environment variable PATH. some synthesifers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the microphone speed will be ignored when & create; & HTML; (this is because the HTML is turned into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xodes file of the & HTML; -after SSML outline filter, and put the microphone speed up.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which enables management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & box center can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter will be displayed. the network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network settings in the & menu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; Network hardware can't install. physical equipment and their drivers have already been operational and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device is anchored and allows the setting of network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices at installing & Linux; installed and set up. network appliances later added, the drivers have to be loaded with the following files, according to the kernel version.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded when the network settings are selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. at the start of the module network settings, this, the platform used to detect the platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not recognized, the hous selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and releaser's best. by marking the default non-re-quire, this selection will automatically be made automatically at the next start of the network settings.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of network settings can only be seen in system management mode. before, all options are grey, which means that settings can only be considered, changing system management mode at the right end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The module's entire functionality is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interface is used to manage network appliances of the system. all available network appliances are displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be carried out:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings defined network interfaces can be addressed by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button... in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings menu shows the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection of automatic the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP- or BOOTP server will provide all required TCP / IP information at each system start. in the select list, either DHCP or BOOTP may be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With selecting Manually, without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP address can be performed. in the input field IP address, the network netmask is required.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initiates the network interface during booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values in this dialog will be displayed as the properties of the device in the box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not used. the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. you can determine if the address is already used in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switching off network device is operated by selecting from the list and click on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switch off an unactivated network device is activated through a selection from the list and click on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet which allows the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If your computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected, in which the Gateway Computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer support with DNS support replaces the respective IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS solves this name into an IP address such as 123.45,678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the namespace part of the riding resolution allows a simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified. DNS entries can be accessed by selecting a contract and execution or hergrading in the list with buttons or herent in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button below... from the batch machine to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button to add. the entry will then be inserted into the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the batch machine to the name resolution, select one entry and click on the button Edit.... It is displayed the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of nament computers describes host-to IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily in boats when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this is still in the test version of IP should replace in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer, and click on Add.... The dialogue new alias is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known host name and click the button. if the known host has several alias names, de button add several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select one entry of a well-known computer from the list and select Edit.... The acquaintances of your computer is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">One of the following tasks can be executed, then with clicking OK, the list of the static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings on the network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it suffices when & KDE; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with a graphical surface, such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient for this case; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to be experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should afford this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given via basic network technique, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace continuous knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information is mediated via the integration of the PC into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). this description has never been expanded by IPv6. this description is therefore concentrated in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge corresponding to the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the contact address given to a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can't be easily chosen any any!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When creating an own small (home) network, the IP address should be switched from a specially for this purpose area to avoid IP address transfer with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be possible through setting of a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the net mask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route that is the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the standard route is required for IP transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section the configuration files are stored by & knetworkconf; where they are filed in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file will sometimes be changed in DSL connections, so it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections, another content is defined.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is sorted by using scripts in SuSEconony. another stand can therefore be expected.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a safety program for banding works on the basis of tar. it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a band. the first goal was to create a surface for tar, which set out my wife: how much longer takes it when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be made by & kdat; it can happen on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; focus the band back and reads the prestressing information of the tape. recognize & kdat; if you don't know if the band is formatted, you will be asked if the band is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the pre-spell, it is looking for the appropriate index on your record. can this not be found, you will be asked whether the tape index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol is changing for the tape drive, in order to indicate that the band has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the bananas can now be searched for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to throwing tape, first must first be solved. there are three methods to evaluate this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; gives a change in the symbol for the band, that the binding for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding notification in the status bar. the band can now be cast out without a risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat it can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band species must be formatted before you can use to save data. this process does not need to formatting a formatting at & kdat; this process must be formatted before using the band of & kdat; usually formatting a formatting of the tape ahead, DAT drives are not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the belt called and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all the data on the band go wrong! after completion of the formatting process the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup, you need to select the required files. that can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in a local file tree. it will only secure this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in a local file-tree with a bunch. only the selected files and / or subfolder are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click the right mouse button on the local file-tree and select in the Shechem menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog settings for backup. in this dialogue you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears to backup. dialogue shows the progress of the backup process, including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder was checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the files in the record for the band with a bunkchen. only the selected files and / or subfolder are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been launched, the dialog settings for verification. in this dialogue you can check your choice and change the working file for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the settings for verification, the dialog appears to check this dialog. this dialogue shows the progress of the test process and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can rebuild the restore, the files must be restored, marked with two types:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. only the selected file or the subfolder is restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Mark the desired files from one of the archives with a bunkchen. only the selected files and / or subfolder are restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been launched, the dialog appears for restoration. in this dialogue you can check your choice and change the working file for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog appears to recover. this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it shows itself as necessary to recreate the tape indexfile using the tape. this process removes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a safety profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a fuse profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working file, in which the backup is to be carried out. the list of the stored files will be updated automatically according to the chosen working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, is that only the files are stored in the same file system, such as the folder. folder, which are on other file systems, you can apply separately under backup files. each record will be regarded as tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last inkretmental backup file, a snapshot file is used since the last increase file, a snapshot file will only be saved, which has changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last ineffectual use.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can set you via the menu option KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be carried:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device node for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variation of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the band is integrated, the command will load into the drive. at some drives it is necessary to be carried out before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, try & kdat to lock the ejection mode. maybe this attitude does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when loosing the integration of & kdat, the band will automatically be cast off. use this option not with Floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; the hardwarfare block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable recorders. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it is writing a file to the start of the tape. this file should only be one memory block on the tape. the file of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the name: seconds, whereby the name of the system is formatted on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the period in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar - archives created directly with the GNU / GNU / tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not deal with increative fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup device. this symbol is only active when a band is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksysteme log; is a & KDE; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can get information on your system or where the system allows you to obtain information on your system or where the system enables fast access to information about problems related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer does in the background. it is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system sets the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems based on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features, which can be filtered and analysed the protocol files specific programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksysteme log; a number of useful functions. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different kinds of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition, and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, provides & ksystemlog; functions available, with their help to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file easily and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksysteme log; initially the most important protocol-file system - to open it, and it opens up instead of its a small news window, so you don't have the protocol / var / log, for normal users usually do not have any permissions to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar after a selected criterion or click on the filter bar. in the default setting, a string line will be displayed next to the filter Show more. then, a protocol line is only displayed, if in one of the columns containing the filter string search engine is contained.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this section. select the sequence of the filter search engine only with entries in accordance with the selected column files. select also in the filter bar the name of a process, it shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines, which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default settings, and helps you recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a remarkable color as protocol lines of the stage hint. the color lines can be switched off-set dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display certain process only (for example, in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can then be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command as for example to the start of the Samba server. in this case you use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to activate new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate substructures. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage. once you have selected a window, select the menu to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has an own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.or.Dort you will find more recent information about the source sources by & ksystemlog.</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section takes some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init quickly develops into the standard for control of the system at the start of the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and even more flexible than the traditional BSD inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I don't want to go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it yourself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is why someone could try to create a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and reformatting. this is why you need to make sure the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service which you want to start with the system or change to another Runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services are not such things like setserial, which will only be launched only once. such calls may include rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie down to / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't want to use a rc.t in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for various places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is listed in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair the / etc / inittab of hand and change the 3. if you have something to pass through, then you will repair it by restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is one link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written so written that there may be an argument as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K includes, the script will stop using the argument. if it includes a S, the script will start called using the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to create a simple way to build machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level, which can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; I also could have a user Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of the available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts between Runlevelling and change the position within one levels by removing it elsewhere. this happens only then if they pull out a record from the area of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed if you select this in a new Runlevel. to select it only on a new Runlevel, you need to select from the menu Edit or select from the context menu, even if the same entry has previously existed in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number is sometimes not calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorting number of entries, before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are currently no possibility to restore entries which were thrown into the paper basket. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the different working ranges (Available systems services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change sorting order number or name manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. connect the tabulator button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if they are available from & ksysv. otherwise they are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution: please check if all configuration files are provided, which are required by the respective system services (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) just end without a message when their configuration files are not provided or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about Runlevel, so that this manual may be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have done changes, you must save them. either you will use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or entry to save in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and user group list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry. it appears in the dialog user and group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only shown if you have extended system settings. only if you are able to make additional settings (Quota) for users, it will appear to make individual settings, if Shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password will appear if Shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD - Unixen.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This cartographical map appears only if for at least a embedded file system limitation (Quota) is activated and initialize (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, can be changed for each user parameter, whereby the restrictions are quoted in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set separately for each file system. the current file system is chosen with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card-map groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user is owned, you will find in the field of the prime group. furthermore, the user can mark the user in other groups by adding them in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select from the menu users or group or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or delete the selected user or selected group works analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the lilo bootmanager, remove the boat password, remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the default operation system, remove, change operating systems, change, change and more.</seg>
